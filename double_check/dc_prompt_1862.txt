Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Illuminated manuscripts from the 15th to 17th centuries featuring intricate floral borders and gold leaf detailing.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Book of Hours of Catherine of Cleves
2. The Grimani Breviary
3. The Hastings Hours
4. The Isabella Breviary

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Lindisfarne Gospels
6. A modern calligraphy wedding invitation
7. The Dead Sea Scrolls
8. A Victorian botanical illustration book
9. An Art Nouveau decorative border design
10. The Gutenberg Bible
11. A Persian miniature painting
12. An Egyptian papyrus scroll
13. A Celtic manuscript
14. A Japanese illustrated scroll
15. A modern gold-embossed book cover
16. An Ottoman calligraphy manuscript
17. A Renaissance fresco
18. A medieval tapestry
19. An illuminated Torah scroll
20. A Chinese silk painting scroll
21. A Byzantine mosaic
22. An Art Deco illustration
23. A Baroque altar piece
24. A Gothic stained glass window

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
