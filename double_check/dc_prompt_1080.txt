Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or man-made structures that emit light or heat through chemical reactions or physical processes, often used for illumination, signaling, or celebration.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. lighthouse
2. tiki torch
3. sparkler
4. glow stick

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. mirror
6. crystal prism
7. stained glass window
8. solar panel
9. reflective road sign
10. disco ball
11. neon paint
12. fluorescent clothing
13. glow-in-the-dark sticker
14. LED screen
15. television
16. smartphone display
17. laser pointer
18. projector
19. computer monitor
20. traffic light
21. car headlight
22. flashlight
23. desk lamp
24. ceiling fan light

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
