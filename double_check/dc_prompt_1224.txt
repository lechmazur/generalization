Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Celestial or terrestrial phenomena that exhibit a central point of immense gravitational influence surrounded by a distinct, observable boundary or structure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. black hole
2. hurricane
3. galaxy
4. tornado

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. comet
6. asteroid
7. planet
8. star
9. moon
10. nebula
11. supernova
12. aurora
13. eclipse
14. meteor shower
15. rainbow
16. volcano
17. earthquake
18. tsunami
19. lightning
20. solar flare
21. sandstorm
22. cyclone
23. aurora borealis
24. geyser

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
