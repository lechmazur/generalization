Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used for writing that are no longer in common use but were once prevalent in specific cultures or regions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a quill pen
2. a stylus for wax tablets
3. a reed brush for papyrus
4. a slate pencil

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a typewriter
6. a fountain pen
7. a ballpoint pen
8. a mechanical pencil
9. a chalkboard
10. a notebook
11. a printer
12. a highlighter
13. a marker
14. a whiteboard
15. a pencil sharpener
16. a ruler
17. a stapler
18. a paperclip
19. a glue stick
20. a rubber stamp
21. a correction tape
22. a calligraphy pen
23. a paintbrush
24. a crayon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
