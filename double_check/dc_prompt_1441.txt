Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Competitive events where participants must navigate backwards while moving forward along a predetermined course

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a reverse triathlon where participants swim, bike, and run backward along the course
2. a backward rowing race where competitors face the finish line while rowing in reverse
3. a reverse orienteering event where participants navigate a course backward using a map
4. a backward skiing competition where skiers descend a slope facing uphill

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a marathon
6. a relay race
7. a car rally
8. a cycling time trial
9. a swimming race
10. a figure skating competition
11. a parkour challenge
12. a horse racing event
13. a skateboarding competition
14. a cross-country running event
15. a dragon boat race
16. a bobsled competition
17. a kayaking race
18. a mountain biking event
19. a sailing regatta
20. a snowboarding competition
21. a gymnastics floor routine
22. a synchronized swimming performance
23. a rock climbing competition
24. a track and field event

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
