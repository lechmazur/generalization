Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Measurement systems that group items into nested categories where each level contains exactly three subdivisions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Dewey Decimal Classification system
2. The U.S. military rank structure
3. Traditional Chinese administrative divisions during Tang Dynasty
4. The Linnaean taxonomy system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The metric system
6. Binary tree structures
7. The periodic table
8. Library of Congress Classification
9. RGB color model
10. Musical note divisions
11. Geological time periods
12. Computer file systems
13. DNA nucleotide organization
14. Chemical compound nomenclature
15. Academic degree classifications
16. Olympic medal rankings
17. Chess piece hierarchy
18. Planetary classification system
19. Wind speed scales
20. Corporate organizational charts
21. School grade levels
22. Internet domain hierarchy
23. Political subdivision systems
24. Military time classification

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
