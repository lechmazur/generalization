Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to provide protection or coverage that incorporate geometric patterns for structural integrity or aesthetic purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a honeycomb-patterned motorcycle helmet
2. a geodesic dome tent
3. a chainmail armor shirt
4. a quilted jacket with diamond stitching

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a plain raincoat
6. a smooth leather wallet
7. a wooden baseball bat
8. a silk scarf
9. a plastic water bottle
10. a woolen sweater
11. a glass window pane
12. a metal spoon
13. a cotton t-shirt
14. a ceramic vase
15. a rubber tire
16. a nylon backpack
17. a paper notebook
18. a wooden chair
19. a plastic comb
20. a stone statue
21. a wool blanket
22. a leather belt
23. a metal key
24. a cotton pillowcase

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
