Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological devices that collect and transmit environmental data from remote locations using autonomous systems.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ocean buoy weather station
2. wildlife tracking collar
3. forest fire detection drone
4. glacier monitoring sensor array

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. thermometer
6. security camera
7. smoke detector
8. barometer
9. seismograph
10. telescope
11. radar system
12. traffic counter
13. wind vane
14. rain gauge
15. compass
16. satellite dish
17. radio antenna
18. motion sensor
19. webcam
20. weather balloon
21. pH meter
22. anemometer
23. light meter
24. humidity sensor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
