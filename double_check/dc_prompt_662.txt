Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Moments or places characterized by a sudden, profound silence amidst an otherwise dynamic or bustling environment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The moment a crowded train station falls silent as a train departs, leaving only the echo of its wheels.
2. A bustling city street where all noise ceases during a sudden, unexpected snowfall.
3. The instant a packed concert hall hushes in anticipation just before the orchestra begins to play.
4. A lively playground where all children stop and listen as a distant siren wails.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A quiet library where people are always expected to be silent.
6. The calm atmosphere of a deserted beach at dawn.
7. A serene forest where the only sounds are those of nature.
8. The peaceful ambiance of a meditation retreat.
9. A moment of silence observed during a memorial service.
10. The stillness of a church during a prayer.
11. The quietness of a countryside road with no traffic.
12. The silence of a museum where visitors are hushed.
13. The tranquility of a yoga class in session.
14. The hushed tones of a hospital ward at night.
15. The calm before a storm when the wind dies down.
16. The silence of a graveyard at midnight.
17. The quiet of a sleeping household in the early morning.
18. The stillness of a deserted town square at night.
19. The silence of a classroom during an exam.
20. The quiet of a park in the early hours before it opens.
21. The hush of a theater audience waiting for the curtain to rise.
22. The silence of a snowy landscape with no one around.
23. The quiet of a remote mountain trail.
24. The stillness of a lake at dusk with no boats or people.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
