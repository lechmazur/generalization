Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects created or significantly altered by renowned artists during conflicts in the 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Guernica by Pablo Picasso
2. The Third of May 1808 by Francisco Goya
3. War Requiem by Benjamin Britten
4. Wartime Chair by Gerrit Rietveld

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh
6. The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí
7. Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci
8. The Scream by Edvard Munch
9. Water Lilies by Claude Monet
10. The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli
11. American Gothic by Grant Wood
12. The Thinker by Auguste Rodin
13. Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer
14. The Kiss by Gustav Klimt
15. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon by Pablo Picasso
16. The Night Watch by Rembrandt
17. David by Michelangelo
18. The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci
19. Sunflowers by Vincent van Gogh
20. The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck
21. The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch
22. The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo
23. Liberty Leading the People by Eugène Delacroix
24. The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
