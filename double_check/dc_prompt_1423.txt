Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical or logical systems that were developed to address ethical questions but ended up having significant applications in computer science

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Game Theory
2. Bayesian Networks
3. Decision Theory
4. Fuzzy Logic

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Euclidean Geometry
6. Quantum Mechanics
7. Relativity Theory
8. String Theory
9. Chaos Theory
10. Graph Theory
11. Number Theory
12. Topology
13. Set Theory
14. Linear Algebra
15. Calculus
16. Cryptography
17. Artificial Intelligence
18. Machine Learning
19. Data Mining
20. Neural Networks
21. Formal Language Theory
22. Automata Theory
23. Combinatorics
24. Probability Theory

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
