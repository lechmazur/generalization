Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize natural subterranean heat sources for energy production and incorporate advanced cryptographic verification methods

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Blockchain-secured geothermal power plant in Iceland's Hellishei√∞i field
2. Zero-knowledge proof validated thermal energy extraction system in New Zealand's Wairakei Valley
3. Smart contract-enabled underground steam harvesting facility in California's Geysers
4. Distributed ledger monitored heat pump network in Turkey's Menderes Graben

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Solar thermal power plant
6. Traditional geothermal heating system
7. Bitcoin mining facility
8. Underground data center
9. Ethereum validation node
10. Ground source heat pump
11. Volcanic monitoring station
12. Digital signature verification system
13. Hydrothermal vent energy extractor
14. Quantum encryption facility
15. Underground thermal storage unit
16. Blockchain development laboratory
17. Hot spring power generator
18. Cryptographic security center
19. Magma energy research facility
20. Digital identity verification platform
21. Thermal gradient measurement system
22. Hash-based authentication server
23. Underground thermal reservoir
24. Public key infrastructure facility

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
