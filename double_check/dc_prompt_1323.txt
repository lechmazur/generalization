Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or entities that operate in isolation but rely on external frameworks or infrastructures to function effectively

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A landlocked country's economy
2. A self-sufficient off-grid cabin reliant on deliveries for certain supplies
3. A virtual machine running on a host operating system
4. A satellite orbiting Earth, dependent on ground stations for communication and control

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bicycle
6. A coral reef
7. The human digestive system
8. A solar panel
9. A wind turbine
10. A car
11. A smartphone app
12. A social media platform
13. An online multiplayer game
14. A power grid
15. The internet
16. A supply chain
17. An ecosystem
18. A colony of ants
19. A beehive
20. A flock of birds
21. A school of fish
22. A pack of wolves
23. A human cell
24. A computer network

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
