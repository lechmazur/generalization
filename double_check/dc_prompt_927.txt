Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations where natural formations create protective barriers against external elements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a coral reef
2. a mountain range
3. a dense forest
4. a sand dune system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a desert
6. a river delta
7. a volcanic crater
8. a glacier
9. a canyon
10. a waterfall
11. a cave
12. a plateau
13. a marsh
14. a tundra
15. a savanna
16. a fjord
17. a geyser
18. a hot spring
19. a lagoon
20. a peninsula
21. an atoll
22. a butte
23. a mesa
24. a rift valley

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
