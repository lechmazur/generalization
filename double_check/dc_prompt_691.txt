Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic movements or techniques that have influenced both visual arts and artificial intelligence development

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Impressionism's focus on capturing light and color has influenced both painting and AI-generated art, particularly in style transfer algorithms.
2. Cubism's exploration of geometric forms and multiple perspectives has parallels in 3D modeling and computer vision, influencing object recognition and scene understanding.
3. Surrealism's emphasis on dreamlike imagery and unexpected juxtapositions finds echoes in GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) used to create fantastical and novel visual outputs.
4. Pointillism's technique of using dots to create an image has influenced digital image processing and pixel-based art generation in AI.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Renaissance perspective
6. Baroque dynamism
7. Romanticism's emotional expression
8. Art Nouveau's organic forms
9. Abstract Expressionism
10. Pop Art
11. Minimalism
12. Photorealism
13. Machine learning algorithms for music composition
14. Natural language processing for poetry generation
15. AI-powered animation tools
16. Virtual reality experiences
17. Data visualization techniques
18. Algorithmic trading in financial markets
19. Medical image analysis
20. Robotics and automation
21. Self-driving car technology
22. Facial recognition software
23. Big data analytics
24. Cloud computing infrastructure

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
