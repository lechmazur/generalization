Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Wellness destinations built on artificially constructed bodies of water that incorporate elements of Eastern spirituality into their branding and services

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A luxury resort built around a large, man-made lagoon, offering meditation retreats led by Buddhist monks and incorporating Balinese architecture.
2. A wellness center on a human-engineered lake, specializing in Ayurvedic treatments and featuring yoga pavilions overlooking the water.
3. A spa retreat constructed on a purpose-built reservoir, providing Taoist-inspired wellness practices and incorporating feng shui design principles.
4. A floating meditation center on an artificial pond, offering Zen garden experiences and guided mindfulness sessions with certified instructors.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A hot springs resort in a natural volcanic valley.
6. A yoga studio in a bustling city center.
7. A meditation app with guided visualizations.
8. A nature retreat in a remote forest.
9. A beachside hotel with ocean views.
10. A fitness center with state-of-the-art equipment.
11. A health food store selling organic produce.
12. A wellness blog promoting healthy lifestyle tips.
13. A cruise ship with spa facilities.
14. A mountain lodge with hiking trails.
15. A desert spa with Native American-inspired treatments.
16. A lakeside cabin with fishing opportunities.
17. A riverside campground with nature walks.
18. A treehouse hotel in a rainforest canopy.
19. An eco-resort powered by renewable energy.
20. A wellness festival with music and workshops.
21. A spiritual retreat center in a historic monastery.
22. A holistic health clinic offering alternative therapies.
23. A botanical garden with medicinal plants.
24. A community garden promoting urban farming.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
