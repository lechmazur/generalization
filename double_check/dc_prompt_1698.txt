Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects traditionally made by pouring hot material into a cavity that creates a negative space which becomes functional when the material cools and hardens

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a cast iron skillet
2. a bronze statue
3. a glass bottle
4. a concrete block

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wooden chair
6. a knitted sweater
7. a ceramic vase
8. a plastic water bottle
9. a paper cup
10. a metal sheet
11. a clay pot
12. a woven basket
13. a leather wallet
14. a stone sculpture
15. a rubber tire
16. a cardboard box
17. a wool blanket
18. a bamboo flute
19. a steel beam
20. a silk scarf
21. a plastic toy
22. a glass window pane
23. a copper wire
24. a porcelain dish

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
