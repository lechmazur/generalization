Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or cultural phenomena that are named after specific geographic locations and embody a unique characteristic or identity tied to that place.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Champagne
2. Darjeeling tea
3. Scotch whisky
4. Havana cigar

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Swiss cheese
6. French fries
7. Buffalo wings
8. Boston cream pie
9. New York cheesecake
10. Italian dressing
11. Greek yogurt
12. American football
13. Mexican wave
14. English breakfast tea
15. Belgian waffles
16. Turkish delight
17. Russian roulette
18. Spanish omelette
19. German chocolate cake
20. Canadian bacon
21. Indian summer
22. Chinese checkers
23. Japanese garden
24. Australian rules football

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
