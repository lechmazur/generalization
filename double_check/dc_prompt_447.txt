Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographic features whose names contain a repeated letter sequence of at least two letters, where the repeated sequence is not a single letter repeated.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mississippi River
2. Allegheny Mountains
3. Appalachian Trail
4. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Amazon River
6. Rocky Mountains
7. Lake Superior
8. Grand Canyon
9. Mount Everest
10. Yosemite National Park
11. Niagara Falls
12. Great Barrier Reef
13. Hudson Bay
14. Victoria Falls
15. Andes Mountains
16. Lake Victoria
17. Yellowstone National Park
18. Gobi Desert
19. Mount Kilimanjaro
20. Black Sea
21. Arctic Ocean
22. Death Valley
23. Serengeti Plains
24. Galapagos Islands

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
