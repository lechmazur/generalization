Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Divination or fortune-telling methods that rely on interpreting random patterns in scattered or dispersed materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Interpreting the patterns formed by tea leaves at the bottom of a cup
2. Reading the shapes and configurations of spilled oil on water
3. Analyzing the arrangement of scattered bones or shells
4. Deciphering the patterns created by tossed grains or seeds

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Using a crystal ball to foresee future events
6. Reading tarot cards to predict outcomes
7. Interpreting the lines on a person's palm
8. Consulting the I Ching by throwing coins
9. Observing the flight patterns of birds for omens
10. Analyzing astrological charts based on birth dates
11. Using numerology to understand life paths
12. Interpreting dreams for prophetic insights
13. Reading the aura around a person
14. Using a pendulum to answer yes or no questions
15. Consulting oracle bones by heating them to produce cracks
16. Interpreting the flight of arrows for divination
17. Using geomancy to predict future events based on earth patterns
18. Reading the entrails of animals for signs
19. Interpreting the smoke patterns from burning incense
20. Using bibliomancy to randomly select passages from books
21. Observing cloud formations for weather predictions
22. Interpreting the sounds of wind in trees for omens
23. Using a ouija board to communicate with spirits
24. Reading the patterns in a person's handwriting

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
