Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures designed for covert functionality while appearing to serve an ordinary or unrelated purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A hollow book safe with a false interior
2. A walking cane with a concealed sword inside
3. A decorative garden rock with a hidden key compartment
4. A teddy bear with an integrated nanny cam

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A secret underground bunker
6. A camouflage military uniform
7. A two-way mirror
8. A hidden door in a wall
9. A trap door
10. An invisible ink pen
11. A secret compartment
12. A false bottom drawer
13. A spy satellite
14. A security camera
15. A hidden microphone
16. A safe behind a painting
17. A panic room
18. A disguise kit
19. A voice changer
20. A secret passage
21. A hidden basement
22. A bug detector
23. A lockpick set
24. A signal jammer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
