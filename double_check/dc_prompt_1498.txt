Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Medieval European women who were executed and later had their convictions officially overturned or were formally exonerated by religious or government authorities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Joan of Arc, executed in 1431 and later exonerated by the Catholic Church in 1456
2. Margery Jourdemayne, accused of witchcraft and executed in 1441, later cleared of charges posthumously
3. Petronilla de Meath, executed for heresy in 1324, later exonerated by the Church in the 20th century
4. Anne Askew, executed for heresy in 1546, later recognized as a martyr by Protestant reformers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a medieval knight executed for treason
6. a woman accused of witchcraft but never formally exonerated
7. a male heretic executed and later pardoned
8. a woman executed for adultery in medieval Europe
9. a woman accused of witchcraft who escaped execution
10. a medieval queen executed for political reasons
11. a woman executed for theft in medieval Europe
12. a woman accused of witchcraft but acquitted at trial
13. a woman executed for murder in medieval Europe
14. a woman executed for treason without exoneration
15. a woman accused of witchcraft but pardoned before execution
16. a woman executed for heresy without later exoneration
17. a woman executed for blasphemy in medieval Europe
18. a woman executed for witchcraft in colonial America
19. a woman executed for sorcery in medieval Europe
20. a woman executed for rebellion in medieval Europe
21. a woman executed for poisoning in medieval Europe
22. a woman executed for infanticide in medieval Europe
23. a woman executed for apostasy in medieval Europe
24. a woman executed for witchcraft in early modern Europe

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
