Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical communication systems designed to regularly transmit small, lightweight objects over long distances using relay stations or intermediary points.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Pneumatic tube transport systems
2. Pony Express mail delivery network
3. 19th century optical telegraph stations
4. Medieval homing pigeon relay networks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Email system
6. Radio broadcasting tower
7. Telephone lines
8. Cargo ships
9. Railway network
10. Satellite communication
11. Interstate highway system
12. Underground subway
13. Fiber optic cables
14. Commercial airline routes
15. Package delivery trucks
16. Cellular network towers
17. Cargo aircraft
18. Bus transit system
19. Conveyor belt system
20. Telegraph wires
21. Shipping container ports
22. Microwave transmission towers
23. Pipeline network
24. Bicycle courier service

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
