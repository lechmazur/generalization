Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Literary works that explore the concept of time through the use of stream of consciousness narrative technique.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway," where the protagonist's thoughts flow freely, reflecting on past and present moments throughout a single day.
2. James Joyce's "Ulysses," which uses stream of consciousness to delve into the characters' minds, exploring their perceptions of time and memory over the course of a day.
3. Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time," particularly in the section "Swann's Way," where the narrator's stream of consciousness triggers memories and reflections on time.
4. William Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury," where the use of stream of consciousness in different sections reveals the characters' fragmented sense of time and memory.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A novel that uses a linear timeline to explore the life of a character from birth to death.
6. A film that uses flashbacks to show a character's past experiences.
7. A poem that reflects on the passage of time using traditional narrative structure.
8. A play that uses dialogue to discuss the concept of time without delving into characters' inner thoughts.
9. A short story that uses third-person omniscient narration to explore time travel.
10. A memoir that chronicles the author's life events in chronological order.
11. A science fiction novel that explores time dilation without using stream of consciousness.
12. A historical fiction book that uses a straightforward narrative to depict events across different time periods.
13. A graphic novel that uses visual storytelling to represent the passage of time.
14. A television series that uses episodic structure to show characters aging over time.
15. A philosophical essay that discusses the nature of time without using narrative techniques.
16. A fantasy novel that uses a magical device to manipulate time, narrated in third person.
17. A documentary that explores the history of a city over several centuries.
18. A biography that details the life of a historical figure using a chronological approach.
19. A dystopian novel that examines the control of time by a totalitarian regime, using a linear narrative.
20. A collection of short stories that each explore different aspects of time, but use traditional storytelling methods.
21. A mystery novel that uses a detective's investigation to uncover past events, narrated in the third person.
22. A romance novel that follows the development of a relationship over time, using a straightforward narrative.
23. A children's book that uses illustrations and simple text to teach about the concept of time.
24. A psychological thriller that uses a non-linear timeline to build suspense, but does not use stream of consciousness.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
