Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural spaces that incorporate optical illusions to enhance or alter the perception of depth and dimension.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ames Room
2. Forced perspective corridor in Palazzo Spada, Rome
3. Villanueva Building, MIT with manipulated window sizes
4. Installation art using mirrors and distorted surfaces to create infinite reflections or compressed spaces

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A building with large windows offering panoramic views
6. A house with high ceilings
7. A long hallway with repeating patterns
8. A room painted in light colors to make it feel bigger
9. A garden with converging paths
10. A skyscraper with a tapered design
11. A bridge with a parabolic arch
12. A stadium with tiered seating
13. A church with a tall spire
14. A museum with interactive exhibits
15. A theater with a raked stage
16. A library with tall bookshelves
17. A park with a winding path
18. A city with a grid layout
19. A desert with vast open spaces
20. An ocean with a seemingly endless horizon
21. A mountain range with varying elevations
22. A forest with dense vegetation
23. A cave with a narrow entrance
24. A tunnel with a distant light at the end

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
