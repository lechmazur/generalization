Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): ornate handmade textiles from Central Asia featuring geometric patterns

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a silk ikat robe with intricate diamond motifs
2. a woolen carpet with interlocking octagonal designs
3. a velvet wall hanging featuring tessellated star patterns
4. a cotton embroidered shawl with repeating zigzag borders

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a Persian rug with floral motifs
6. a Japanese kimono with cherry blossom patterns
7. a Navajo blanket with tribal symbols
8. a Scottish tartan plaid
9. a Moroccan leather pouf
10. a Chinese silk painting of a dragon
11. a batik sarong from Indonesia
12. a French tapestry depicting a pastoral scene
13. a Mexican serape with striped designs
14. an Indian sari with paisley prints
15. a Turkish kilim with animal figures
16. a Peruvian alpaca poncho
17. a Greek embroidered tablecloth
18. a Scandinavian knitted sweater
19. a Balinese batik wall art
20. a Tibetan prayer flag
21. a Venetian lace table runner
22. a Native American beaded moccasins
23. a Korean hanbok with floral embroidery
24. a West African kente cloth

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
