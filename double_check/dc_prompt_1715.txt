Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical traditions that feature continuous drone notes maintained through circular breathing techniques

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. didgeridoo music from Indigenous Australian cultures
2. Tuvan throat singing with accompanying igil or doshpuluur
3. Indian classical music featuring the tanpura drone
4. Moroccan Gnawa music with the sintir drone

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. bagpipe music from Scotland
6. Gregorian chant with organ accompaniment
7. flamenco guitar with rhythmic strumming
8. jazz saxophone solos
9. African drumming ensembles
10. classical piano sonatas
11. bluegrass banjo picking
12. opera arias with orchestral backing
13. electronic dance music with bass drops
14. reggae music with offbeat guitar chords
15. Chinese guzheng performances
16. Irish fiddle tunes
17. hip-hop beats with sampled loops
18. baroque harpsichord compositions
19. rock guitar riffs with distortion
20. samba percussion rhythms
21. country music with pedal steel guitar
22. choir singing in four-part harmony
23. blues harmonica solos
24. kora music from West Africa

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
