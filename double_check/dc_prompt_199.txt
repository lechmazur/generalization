Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or artifacts from the late 19th century that feature circular patterns and are associated with social gatherings.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A punch bowl with a repeating circular fruit slice pattern around the rim.
2. A tablecloth with a large, central circular medallion and radiating circular floral patterns used for a Victorian tea party.
3. A set of porcelain plates with a repeating circular border design, used for formal dinners.
4. A stained-glass window in a social club featuring a rose window design.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A pocket watch
6. A bicycle wheel
7. A phonograph record
8. A top hat
9. A horse-drawn carriage
10. A corset
11. A type writer
12. A kerosene lamp
13. A cast iron stove
14. A rocking chair
15. A gramophone horn
16. A camera lens
17. A teacup without a circular pattern
18. A silver serving tray with a rectangular shape
19. A set of dominoes
20. A deck of playing cards
21. A newspaper
22. A painting of a landscape
23. A music box
24. A pair of opera glasses

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
