Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural designs inspired by literary or mythological narratives that aim to influence human behavior or perception.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A building designed with a labyrinthine structure to evoke the myth of the Minotaur, encouraging visitors to reflect on their journey and choices.
2. An office complex with a central atrium inspired by the story of Icarus, using height and light to inspire ambition and caution in its occupants.
3. A library designed with a tree-like structure, drawing from the myth of Yggdrasil, to foster a sense of growth and interconnectedness among its users.
4. A residential complex with rooms arranged to mimic the narrative flow of Dante's Inferno, aiming to influence residents' perceptions of their personal journeys.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A skyscraper designed to maximize natural light and energy efficiency.
6. A museum dedicated to the history of architecture.
7. A public park designed to promote community interaction.
8. A bridge designed for aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.
9. A shopping mall with a focus on sustainability.
10. A residential building with smart home technology.
11. A theater designed to enhance the acoustics for performances.
12. A sports stadium designed for optimal viewing and fan experience.
13. A hospital designed to promote healing and comfort.
14. A school building designed to facilitate learning and collaboration.
15. A government building designed to reflect national identity.
16. A hotel designed to provide luxury and comfort.
17. A restaurant designed to enhance the dining experience.
18. A factory designed for efficiency and safety.
19. A train station designed for ease of access and flow.
20. A library designed to maximize storage and accessibility of books.
21. A community center designed to serve diverse populations.
22. A concert hall designed for optimal sound quality.
23. A skyscraper designed to withstand earthquakes.
24. A museum designed to showcase art and history.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
