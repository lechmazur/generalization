Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical or mythological locations referenced in the titles of works featuring Vincent Price as a central figure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Pit and the Pendulum
2. The Masque of the Red Death
3. The Tomb of Ligeia
4. The Abominable Dr. Phibes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Raven
6. The Fly
7. House of Wax
8. The Tingler
9. The Last Man on Earth
10. Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine
11. Theatre of Blood
12. The Mad Magician
13. The Fall of the House of Usher
14. The Comedy of Terrors
15. The Oblong Box
16. Scream and Scream Again
17. The Monster Club
18. House on Haunted Hill
19. The Bat
20. Dr. Phibes Rises Again
21. The House of the Seven Gables
22. The Whales of August
23. The Invisible Man Returns
24. The Return of the Fly

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
