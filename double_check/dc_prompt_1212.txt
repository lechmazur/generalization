Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): structures or systems that use cyclical or circular patterns to optimize function, balance, or flow

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a water cycle in an ecosystem
2. a feedback loop in a control system
3. a Ferris wheel at an amusement park
4. a circular conveyor belt in a factory

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a straight highway
6. a linear timeline
7. a ladder
8. a one-way street
9. a pendulum clock
10. a spiral staircase
11. a solar panel
12. a wind turbine
13. a linear conveyor belt
14. a straight pipeline
15. a linear equation
16. a straight river
17. a linear accelerator
18. a straight railroad track
19. a linear sequence of events
20. a straight cable car system
21. a linear assembly line
22. a straight escalator
23. a linear irrigation system
24. a straight zip line

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
