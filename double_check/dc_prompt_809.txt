Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Experiences that evoke a profound sense of stillness through contrasting elements of silence and motion.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Watching snowflakes fall in a forest at dawn
2. Standing in an empty cathedral as sunlight streams through stained glass
3. Observing fish swim in a quiet aquarium at midnight
4. Sitting beside a frozen lake while leaves drift overhead

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A meditation retreat
6. The eye of a hurricane
7. A quiet library
8. An empty theater
9. A sleeping child
10. A desert at noon
11. A monastery garden
12. The Northern Lights
13. A candlelit room
14. An abandoned building
15. A zen garden
16. A misty morning
17. A sunset over water
18. A prayer room
19. A mountain peak
20. An art gallery
21. A floating feather
22. A starry night
23. A butterfly garden
24. A windless day

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
