Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for human use that incorporate a functional miniature replica of a larger, real-world structure commonly found in urban environments.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a keychain shaped like a miniature Eiffel Tower
2. a desk lamp with a tiny replica of a city bridge as its base
3. a coffee mug featuring a functional miniature skyscraper as a handle
4. a watch with a tiny working Ferris wheel embedded in its face

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a toy train set
6. a model airplane
7. a dollhouse
8. a miniature garden
9. a snow globe
10. a puzzle of a city skyline
11. a poster of a famous landmark
12. a 3D-printed sculpture of a building
13. a city-themed board game
14. a map of a metropolitan area
15. a postcard featuring a famous bridge
16. a scale model of a car
17. a replica of a historical artifact
18. a city-themed jigsaw puzzle
19. a decorative figurine of a landmark
20. a cityscape painting
21. a miniature train station
22. a souvenir magnet of a famous building
23. a city-themed calendar
24. a diorama of a street scene

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
