Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials or systems that facilitate the transmission of information through structured, non-linear pathways

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) used in web pages
2. Graph databases that manage and query connected data
3. Neural networks in artificial intelligence that process information
4. Blockchain technology for secure, distributed data transactions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional printed book
6. A linear television broadcast
7. A radio signal transmission
8. A postal service delivering letters
9. A telephone conversation
10. A fiber optic cable
11. A satellite communication system
12. A Morse code transmission
13. A newspaper article
14. A public speech
15. A streaming music service
16. A live sports event broadcast
17. A walkie-talkie communication
18. A fax machine transmission
19. A podcast episode
20. A video conference call
21. A digital billboard advertisement
22. A printed magazine
23. A traditional classroom lecture
24. A cinema movie screening

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
