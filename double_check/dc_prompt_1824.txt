Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geometric shapes with more than 10 vertices that can be derived from uniform polychora through cantitruncation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. bitruncated 120-cell
2. cantitruncated 600-cell
3. bitruncated 24-cell
4. cantitruncated 120-cell

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. regular dodecahedron
6. icosahedron
7. truncated icosahedron
8. rhombicosidodecahedron
9. snub dodecahedron
10. truncated cube
11. octahedron
12. truncated tetrahedron
13. cuboctahedron
14. icosidodecahedron
15. truncated octahedron
16. rhombicuboctahedron
17. snub cube
18. great rhombicosidodecahedron
19. great icosidodecahedron
20. small stellated dodecahedron
21. great dodecahedron
22. great icosahedron
23. truncated icosidodecahedron
24. great rhombicuboctahedron

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
