Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Events or objects that have a significant historical impact and are associated with a specific date or period in the late 18th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789
2. The publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman" in 1792
3. The invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in 1793
4. The execution of Louis XVI of France on January 21, 1793

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The American Civil War
6. The invention of the printing press
7. The discovery of penicillin
8. The first moon landing
9. The sinking of the Titanic
10. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
11. The fall of the Roman Empire
12. The Black Death
13. The birth of Jesus Christ
14. The invention of the internet
15. The construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza
16. The Renaissance
17. The Protestant Reformation
18. The French and Indian War
19. The signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776
20. The United States Constitution
21. The reign of Queen Victoria
22. World War I
23. The Industrial Revolution
24. The development of the steam engine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
