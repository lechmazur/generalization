Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or places that serve as repositories for lost or forgotten personal histories, often containing fragmented or incomplete narratives, and are associated with emotional or cultural significance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A dusty, locked trunk in an attic, filled with faded love letters, sepia-toned photographs, and a tattered diary.
2. An abandoned orphanage, its peeling walls echoing with the whispers of children who grew up within its confines.
3. A weathered headstone in a forgotten cemetery, bearing only a name and a date, leaving the rest of the story untold.
4. A shoebox filled with old ticket stubs, postcards, and dried flowers, tucked away in the back of a closet.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A library full of historical documents.
6. A museum showcasing ancient artifacts.
7. A family photo album meticulously maintained and updated.
8. A digital archive of birth certificates and legal records.
9. A time capsule buried with specific intentions for future discovery.
10. A social media profile documenting someone's life in real-time.
11. A security camera recording a specific event.
12. A diary with daily entries detailing current events.
13. A textbook outlining a specific historical period.
14. A newspaper archive accessible online.
15. A personal website dedicated to family genealogy.
16. A university's alumni directory.
17. A government census database.
18. A collection of autographs from famous people.
19. A scrapbook filled with mementos from a recent trip.
20. A playlist of songs that evoke specific memories.
21. A hard drive containing backed-up computer files.
22. A cloud storage account storing personal documents.
23. A voice recorder documenting interviews for a research project.
24. A video recording of a family gathering.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
