Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that undergo a transformative process over extended periods, resulting in a stable, enduring form that retains traces of their original state.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Metamorphic rock
2. A mature tree
3. A fossilized skeleton
4. A complex language

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A melting ice cube
6. A decaying log
7. A cooked egg
8. A folded piece of paper
9. A painted canvas
10. A growing crystal
11. A downloaded file
12. A translated text
13. A learned skill
14. A composed song
15. A built house
16. A written novel
17. A sculpted statue
18. A woven tapestry
19. A brewed cup of tea
20. A baked cake
21. A mixed cocktail
22. A burning candle
23. A rusting nail
24. A blooming flower

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
