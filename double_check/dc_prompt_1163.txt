Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): innovations or practices that emerged from resource scarcity or crisis and led to significant societal advancements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The development of synthetic rubber during World War II
2. The creation of the Green Revolution in response to food shortages
3. The invention of the bicycle during the 19th-century horse shortage
4. The establishment of urban community gardens during economic downturns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the smartphone
6. The creation of the internet
7. The development of the steam engine
8. The discovery of penicillin
9. The invention of the airplane
10. The creation of the printing press
11. The development of nuclear power
12. The invention of the light bulb
13. The creation of the World Wide Web
14. The development of GPS technology
15. The invention of the refrigerator
16. The creation of the assembly line
17. The development of the electric car
18. The invention of the washing machine
19. The creation of social media platforms
20. The development of renewable energy sources
21. The invention of the microwave oven
22. The creation of the first personal computer
23. The development of the telephone
24. The invention of the television

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
