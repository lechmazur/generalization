Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artifacts from pre-Columbian Norse expeditions to North America

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. L'Anse aux Meadows artifacts
2. Viking spindle whorl found in Newfoundland
3. Norse cloak pin discovered in North America
4. Iron rivets from a Norse ship in North America

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Aztec calendar stone
6. Inuit carvings
7. Columbus's ship logs
8. Native American arrowheads
9. Roman coins found in England
10. Egyptian hieroglyphs
11. Chinese porcelain from the Ming Dynasty
12. Spanish galleon treasure
13. Medieval European manuscripts
14. Polynesian navigation charts
15. Greek amphorae
16. Byzantine mosaics
17. Persian rugs
18. Japanese samurai swords
19. French fur trade artifacts
20. British colonial documents
21. Viking artifacts from Scandinavia
22. Roman aqueduct remains
23. Ottoman Empire relics
24. Renaissance paintings

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
