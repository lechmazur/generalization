Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Annual cultural festivals that involve decorating tall wooden poles with flowers and ribbons as a central ritual element

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Maypole Dance at Beltane Festival
2. Majlis Pole Ceremony in Oman
3. Festa de São João in Portugal
4. Obon Festival in Japan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Diwali Festival of Lights
6. Chinese New Year Dragon Dance
7. Oktoberfest in Germany
8. Holi Festival of Colors
9. Rio Carnival in Brazil
10. Thanksgiving Parade in the USA
11. Cherry Blossom Festival in Japan
12. Running of the Bulls in Spain
13. Day of the Dead in Mexico
14. La Tomatina in Spain
15. Burning Man in Nevada
16. Venice Carnival in Italy
17. Songkran Water Festival in Thailand
18. Gion Matsuri in Japan
19. Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland
20. St. Patrick's Day Parade in Ireland
21. Harbin Ice Festival in China
22. Inti Raymi in Peru
23. Up Helly Aa in Scotland
24. Lantern Festival in Taiwan

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
