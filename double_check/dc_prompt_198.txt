Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects with a primary function that have become obsolete due to technological advancements, yet retain a distinctive, recognizable shape.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a rotary telephone
2. a floppy disk
3. a cassette tape
4. a typewriter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a smartphone
6. a vinyl record
7. a Polaroid camera
8. a gramophone
9. a pager
10. a VHS tape
11. a CRT television
12. a film camera
13. a fax machine
14. a Walkman
15. a slide projector
16. a telegraph
17. a phonograph
18. a Betamax tape
19. a boombox
20. a calculator watch
21. a laser disc
22. a transistor radio
23. a Game Boy
24. a digital camera

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
