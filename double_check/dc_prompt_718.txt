Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments that incorporate natural materials and are traditionally used in rituals or ceremonies specific to indigenous cultures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Didgeridoo
2. Native American flute
3. Rainstick
4. Ocean drum

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Violin
6. Piano
7. Trumpet
8. Electric guitar
9. Steel drum
10. Bagpipes
11. Harmonica
12. Sitar
13. Gamelan
14. Tabla
15. Djembe
16. Talking drum
17. Maracas
18. Bongos
19. Kalimba
20. Shakuhachi
21. Koto
22. Erhu
23. Balalaika
24. Accordion

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
