Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient Greek physicians who made major anatomical discoveries that were later proven incorrect but influenced medical thinking for over 1000 years

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Erasistratus believed that the brain was the seat of consciousness and that nerves were hollow tubes carrying animal spirits, a theory that persisted for centuries despite being incorrect.
2. Herophilus proposed that the nervous system was a network of channels carrying pneuma, or vital air, which influenced medical thought for over a millennium, though it was later disproven.
3. Alcmaeon of Croton suggested that the brain was the central organ of sensation and thought, a view that shaped medical understanding for centuries but was not entirely accurate.
4. Praxagoras of Cos distinguished between arteries and veins, believing arteries carried pneuma instead of blood, a misconception that lasted for over a thousand years.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Aristotle's theory of the four humors influenced medical practice for centuries but was not specifically about anatomical discoveries.
6. Hippocrates' concept of the body's natural healing power shaped medical thought but did not involve specific anatomical discoveries.
7. Galen's work on the circulatory system was largely correct and did not fit the theme of incorrect anatomical discoveries.
8. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, an ancient Egyptian medical text, contains anatomical observations but is not from Ancient Greek physicians.
9. Claudius Ptolemy's geocentric model of the universe influenced scientific thought for centuries but is not related to medical anatomy.
10. Paracelsus' theories on chemistry and medicine influenced medical practice but were not specifically about anatomical discoveries.
11. Avicenna's Canon of Medicine was influential but did not focus on incorrect anatomical discoveries by Ancient Greek physicians.
12. The Ayurvedic system of medicine from ancient India influenced medical thought but is not related to Ancient Greek anatomy.
13. Andreas Vesalius' work on human anatomy was largely correct and did not fit the theme of incorrect discoveries.
14. William Harvey's discovery of blood circulation was correct and did not involve incorrect anatomical theories.
15. The Hippocratic Oath, while influential in medicine, is not related to specific anatomical discoveries.
16. Imhotep, an ancient Egyptian physician, made contributions to medicine but is not from Ancient Greece.
17. Theriac, a complex ancient remedy, influenced medical practice but is not related to anatomical discoveries.
18. The concept of miasma as a cause of disease influenced medical thought but is not about anatomical discoveries.
19. The ancient Chinese practice of acupuncture influenced medical thought but is not related to Ancient Greek anatomy.
20. The theory of spontaneous generation influenced scientific thought but is not related to medical anatomy.
21. The ancient Roman physician Celsus wrote on medicine but did not make major incorrect anatomical discoveries.
22. The medieval Islamic physician Rhazes made contributions to medicine but is not from Ancient Greece.
23. The ancient Indian physician Sushruta made contributions to surgery but is not from Ancient Greece.
24. The concept of vitalism in medicine influenced medical thought but is not about specific anatomical discoveries.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
