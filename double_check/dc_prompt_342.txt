Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical inventions patented between 1830 and 1840 that directly contributed to advancements in communication technology.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Morse's telegraph
2. Wheatstone and Cooke's five-needle telegraph
3. Bain's chemical telegraph
4. Davenport's electric printing telegraph

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the steam engine
6. the cotton gin
7. the phonograph
8. the typewriter
9. the telephone
10. the camera obscura
11. the printing press
12. the electric motor
13. the incandescent light bulb
14. the radio
15. the phonautograph
16. the daguerreotype
17. the sewing machine
18. the bicycle
19. the mechanical calculator
20. the gramophone
21. the pneumatic tire
22. the safety pin
23. the revolver
24. the dynamo

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
