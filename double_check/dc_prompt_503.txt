Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures built primarily to facilitate the loading and unloading of cargo from ships, located on islands accessible only by bridge or tunnel.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Red Hook Container Terminal on Governors Island
2. Port of Alameda on Alameda Island
3. Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island
4. Port of Coronado on Coronado Island

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Port of Los Angeles
6. Port of Singapore
7. Ferry terminal on Ellis Island
8. Navy Pier in Chicago
9. Port of Hong Kong
10. Port of Seattle
11. Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco
12. Port of Rotterdam
13. Venice Cruise Terminal
14. Sydney Harbour Port
15. Key West Seaport
16. Port of Miami
17. Port of New Orleans
18. Pier 39 in San Francisco
19. Port of Vancouver
20. Port of Charleston
21. Port of Savannah
22. Port of Oakland
23. Port of Baltimore
24. Port of Long Beach

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
