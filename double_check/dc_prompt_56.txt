Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures that utilize tensegrity principles for primary load-bearing support.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Kurilpa Bridge in Brisbane, Australia
2. The Blur Building at the Swiss Expo in 2002
3. The Needle Tower by Kenneth Snelson at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C.
4. The Biosphere 2 in Arizona, USA

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A suspension bridge
6. A geodesic dome
7. A cable-stayed bridge
8. A skyscraper with a steel frame
9. A tent supported by poles and ropes
10. A wooden truss bridge
11. A reinforced concrete building
12. A steel arch bridge
13. A cantilever bridge
14. A masonry arch bridge
15. A tensile fabric structure
16. A suspension roof
17. A cable net fa√ßade
18. A pneumatic structure
19. A space frame structure
20. A folded plate structure
21. A shell structure
22. A grid shell structure
23. A membrane structure
24. A beam and column structure

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
