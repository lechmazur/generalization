Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Manufactured objects designed for interlocking with identical copies of themselves to create a larger, contiguous surface or structure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lego brick
2. Floor tile
3. Jigsaw puzzle piece
4. Paving stone

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Chain link
6. Train car
7. Rope
8. Zipper
9. Button
10. Magnet
11. Paperclip
12. Shoelace
13. Gear
14. Socket and plug
15. Bolt and nut
16. Domino
17. Key and lock
18. USB cable
19. Electrical wire
20. Pipe fitting
21. Building block (generic)
22. Fence post
23. Railroad track section
24. Brick (generic)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
