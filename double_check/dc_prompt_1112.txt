Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or objects that involve the interplay of chance and strategy, where outcomes are influenced by both deliberate decision-making and unpredictable elements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. poker
2. backgammon
3. stock market investing
4. fantasy sports leagues

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. chess
6. roulette
7. tic-tac-toe
8. lottery
9. checkers
10. blackjack
11. dominoes
12. slot machines
13. go
14. rock-paper-scissors
15. monopoly
16. craps
17. bridge
18. mahjong
19. snakes and ladders
20. roulette
21. solitaire
22. war (card game)
23. connect four
24. jenga

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
