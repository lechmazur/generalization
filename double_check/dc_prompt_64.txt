Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures that use a base-20 counting method for organization or classification.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Maya numeral system
2. The vigesimal counting system used by the Aztecs
3. The traditional counting method of the Yoruba people
4. The base-20 number system used in some Papua New Guinean languages

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The decimal system
6. The binary system
7. The hexadecimal system
8. The duodecimal system
9. The octal system
10. The sexagesimal system used by the ancient Sumerians
11. The Roman numeral system
12. The Chinese numeral system
13. The Arabic numeral system
14. The Babylonian numeral system
15. The Egyptian numeral system
16. The Greek numeral system
17. The Indian numeral system
18. The Japanese numeral system
19. The Korean numeral system
20. The Thai numeral system
21. The Hebrew numeral system
22. The Incan quipu system
23. The tally system
24. The abacus

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
