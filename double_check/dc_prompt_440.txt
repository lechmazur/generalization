Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things named after geographic features that are not themselves those features.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chesapeake Bay Retriever
2. Manhattan clam chowder
3. Alaskan king crab
4. Himalayan salt lamp

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Rocky Mountain spotted fever
6. Long Island iced tea
7. Black Forest cake
8. Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort
9. Grand Canyon National Park
10. Mount Everest climbing boots
11. Pacific Ocean salmon
12. Sahara Desert sand
13. Amazon River dolphin
14. Andes Mountains trekking poles
15. Death Valley National Park visitor center
16. Mississippi River steamboat
17. Great Barrier Reef snorkeling gear
18. Niagara Falls boat tour
19. Swiss Alps ski resort
20. Garnacha (grape from Aragon, Spain)
21. Darjeeling tea (from Darjeeling, India)
22. Napa Valley wine (from Napa Valley, California)
23. Florida orange
24. Idaho potato

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
