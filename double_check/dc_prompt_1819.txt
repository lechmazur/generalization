Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures hidden behind natural water features

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fallingwater house behind waterfall in Pennsylvania
2. Villa Escudero restaurant behind Labasin Falls
3. Multnomah Falls Lodge behind the waterfall in Oregon
4. Grotto behind Minnehaha Falls in Minneapolis

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hoover Dam
6. Venice canals
7. Fountains of Bellagio
8. Panama Canal locks
9. Pont du Gard aqueduct
10. Underwater hotel in Dubai
11. Floating houses in Amsterdam
12. Bridge over troubled water
13. Lighthouse in the ocean
14. Water mill on river
15. Alcatraz Island prison
16. Statue of Liberty on island
17. Thames Barrier in London
18. Three Gorges Dam
19. Atlantis Resort Bahamas
20. Golden Gate Bridge
21. Sydney Opera House by harbor
22. Ch√¢teau de Chillon on lake
23. Pier at Brighton Beach
24. Floating markets in Thailand

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
