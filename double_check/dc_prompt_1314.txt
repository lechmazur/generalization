Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or scientific works that capture or represent transitional states between motion and stillness, often through techniques or discoveries that reveal the passage of time or evolution.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Claude Monet's "Water Lilies" series
2. Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies
3. Time-lapse photography of a blooming flower
4. Leonardo da Vinci's "Vitruvian Man"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night"
6. Isaac Newton's laws of motion
7. Salvador Dal√≠'s "The Persistence of Memory"
8. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
9. Michelangelo's "David"
10. Johannes Vermeer's "Girl with a Pearl Earring"
11. Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time"
12. Edvard Munch's "The Scream"
13. Galileo's telescope
14. Rembrandt's "The Night Watch"
15. Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species"
16. Auguste Rodin's "The Thinker"
17. Andy Warhol's "Campbell's Soup Cans"
18. Marie Curie's research on radioactivity
19. Jackson Pollock's "No. 5, 1948"
20. Gregor Mendel's pea plant experiments
21. Pablo Picasso's "Guernica"
22. Thomas Edison's phonograph
23. Frida Kahlo's "The Two Fridas"
24. James Clerk Maxwell's equations

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
