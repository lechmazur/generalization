Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures known for their erratic behavior and controversial leadership that led to significant societal or political upheaval

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Caligula
2. Ivan the Terrible
3. Maximilien Robespierre
4. Mao Zedong

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Genghis Khan
6. Adolf Hitler
7. Joseph Stalin
8. Nero
9. Vlad the Impaler
10. Elizabeth I
11. Napoleon Bonaparte
12. Alexander the Great
13. Julius Caesar
14. Winston Churchill
15. Abraham Lincoln
16. Margaret Thatcher
17. Franklin D. Roosevelt
18. Queen Victoria
19. Martin Luther King Jr.
20. Nelson Mandela
21. Mahatma Gandhi
22. Joan of Arc
23. Che Guevara
24. Vladimir Lenin

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
