Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Hand-built ceramic objects that incorporate naturally occurring crystalline glazes, where the crystalline growth visibly spans across multiple individually thrown and assembled components.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A large, undulating ceramic platter composed of five individually thrown sections, seamlessly joined, with iron-saturated crystalline glaze flowing across the seams, showcasing large, feather-like crystals.
2. A lidded jar formed from three distinct thrown pieces – the base, the body, and the lid – unified by a shimmering, zinc-based crystalline glaze with starburst crystal formations extending across all components.
3. A sculptural, abstract form built from several wheel-thrown conical and cylindrical elements, assembled and fired with a titanium-infused crystalline glaze, resulting in a complex surface of interconnected, needle-like crystals.
4. A wall-mounted ceramic light fixture comprised of multiple thrown and altered porcelain shards, joined and glazed with a flowing, lithium-based crystalline glaze, creating a network of delicate, dendritic crystal growth across the fragmented surface.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A single, wheel-thrown bowl with a vibrant, speckled glaze.
6. A hand-built ceramic sculpture with a smooth, matte finish.
7. A set of porcelain cups with a delicate floral decal.
8. A raku-fired vase with crackled and metallic surface effects.
9. A stoneware teapot with a salt glaze.
10. A porcelain figurine with intricate hand-painted details.
11. A large, coiled ceramic vessel with a textured, earthy surface.
12. A slab-built ceramic box with a geometric pattern.
13. A thrown and altered vase with a glossy, monochrome glaze.
14. A ceramic tile mural with a pictorial design.
15. A hand-built ceramic mask with a vibrant, underglaze decoration.
16. A set of earthenware plates with a rustic, hand-painted border.
17. A thrown porcelain bowl with a celadon glaze.
18. A stoneware pitcher with a reactive, variegated glaze.
19. A ceramic sculpture with a metallic luster glaze.
20. A hand-built ceramic vessel with a crackle glaze.
21. A thrown and altered bottle with a layered, slip-decorated surface.
22. A ceramic wall hanging with a woven texture.
23. A set of porcelain spoons with a mother-of-pearl inlay.
24. A stoneware mug with a carved, geometric design.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
