Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices that use the Doppler effect to measure the speed of a physical phenomenon relative to the device.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a radar gun used by law enforcement to measure vehicle speed
2. a weather radar system detecting wind speed in a storm
3. a medical ultrasound device measuring blood flow velocity
4. a speed sensor in a sports watch tracking running pace

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a thermometer measuring body temperature
6. a barometer detecting atmospheric pressure
7. a seismograph recording earthquake vibrations
8. a pedometer counting steps
9. a GPS device tracking location
10. a heart rate monitor measuring pulse
11. a hygrometer measuring humidity
12. a light meter measuring illumination
13. a sound level meter measuring decibels
14. a tachometer measuring engine RPM
15. a voltmeter measuring electrical voltage
16. a scale measuring weight
17. a compass detecting magnetic north
18. a Geiger counter measuring radiation levels
19. a breathalyzer measuring blood alcohol content
20. a lux meter measuring light intensity
21. a pH meter measuring acidity
22. a wind vane measuring wind direction
23. a rain gauge measuring precipitation
24. a stopwatch measuring elapsed time

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
