Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used for precise measurement in specialized fields

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. micrometer
2. calorimeter
3. sextant
4. spectrophotometer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. ruler
6. stopwatch
7. thermometer
8. compass
9. scale
10. protractor
11. tape measure
12. level
13. odometer
14. barometer
15. altimeter
16. anemometer
17. hygrometer
18. speedometer
19. tachometer
20. voltmeter
21. ammeter
22. ohmmeter
23. thermostat
24. pedometer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
