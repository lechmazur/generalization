Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Entities or phenomena exhibiting a hidden, complex inner structure or system that is not readily apparent from external observation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a seemingly simple rock that contains intricate mineral formations
2. a plain-looking book with a complex narrative structure
3. a basic-looking app with sophisticated algorithms running in the background
4. a traditional woven basket with an elaborate pattern hidden within its design

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a transparent glass
6. a simple wooden table
7. a clear pond
8. a plain white wall
9. a smooth pebble
10. a basic calculator
11. a standard light bulb
12. a regular sheet of paper
13. a typical rubber band
14. a common plastic bottle
15. a straightforward recipe book
16. a simple melody
17. a basic smartphone
18. a plain cotton t-shirt
19. a standard door
20. a typical chair
21. a regular key
22. a simple garden hose
23. a basic wristwatch
24. a standard pencil

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
