Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or practices that serve dual purposes, one of which is symbolic or spiritual, and the other is practical or functional, often rooted in cultural traditions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a dreamcatcher
2. a wedding ring
3. a prayer rug
4. a totem pole

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a smartphone
6. a bicycle
7. a refrigerator
8. a television
9. a hammer
10. a light bulb
11. a computer
12. a microwave oven
13. a pair of scissors
14. a washing machine
15. a car
16. a lawnmower
17. a vacuum cleaner
18. a blender
19. a stapler
20. a pencil sharpener
21. a coffee maker
22. a toaster
23. a sewing machine
24. a drill

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
