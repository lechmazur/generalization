Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artworks created using digital tools and verified through blockchain technology

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. CryptoPunk #7523
2. Beeple's "Everydays: The First 5000 Days"
3. XCopy's "Right-click and Save As guy"
4. Pak's "The Merge"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Van Gogh's "Starry Night"
6. Adobe Photoshop digital painting
7. 3D printed sculpture
8. Instagram filter artwork
9. Microsoft Paint drawing
10. Animated GIF
11. Digital photograph
12. Procreate iPad sketch
13. YouTube video art
14. Virtual reality installation
15. QR code art
16. Algorithmic generative art
17. Augmented reality sculpture
18. Video game concept art
19. Digital collage
20. CGI animation
21. Pixel art
22. Vector illustration
23. AI-generated artwork
24. Digital fractal art

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
