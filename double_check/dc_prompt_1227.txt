Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural artifacts or practices that use natural materials to create symbolic or functional spaces for contemplation, survival, or connection to the environment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The use of sand to create intricate mandalas in Tibetan Buddhist rituals.
2. The construction of sweat lodges using branches and animal hides by Indigenous peoples for spiritual purification.
3. The creation of Zen gardens with raked gravel and carefully placed rocks for meditation in Japanese culture.
4. The weaving of grass huts by Pacific Island communities for shelter and communal gatherings.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern art installation using recycled materials.
6. A digital meditation app.
7. A concrete urban park designed for relaxation.
8. A synthetic yoga mat used for personal practice.
9. A glass greenhouse for growing plants.
10. A metal sculpture in a public space.
11. A plastic raincoat for protection against the elements.
12. A wooden chess set for strategic play.
13. A silk tapestry depicting historical events.
14. A leather-bound journal for personal reflection.
15. A ceramic vase used for floral arrangements.
16. A cotton hammock for outdoor lounging.
17. A rubber tire swing in a playground.
18. A nylon tent for camping.
19. A wool blanket for warmth.
20. A paper origami crane as a symbol of peace.
21. A steel bridge connecting two landmasses.
22. A polyester flag representing a nation.
23. A bamboo flute for musical expression.
24. A clay pot used for cooking traditional meals.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
