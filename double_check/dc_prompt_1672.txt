Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Online platforms launched between 2004-2006 that began as single-purpose services but evolved into major social networks with over 100 million users

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Facebook
2. YouTube
3. Twitter
4. LinkedIn

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Instagram
6. Snapchat
7. TikTok
8. WhatsApp
9. Reddit
10. Pinterest
11. Spotify
12. Netflix
13. Amazon
14. eBay
15. MySpace
16. Flickr
17. Dropbox
18. Slack
19. Zoom
20. Discord
21. Vimeo
22. Quora
23. Medium
24. Tumblr

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
