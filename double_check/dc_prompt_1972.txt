Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): ceramic objects created using the slipcasting technique and inspired by natural forms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A porcelain vase with a texture resembling tree bark
2. A ceramic bowl shaped like a seashell
3. A slipcast sculpture mimicking coral formations
4. A ceramic lamp base designed to look like a cluster of mushrooms

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A hand-thrown clay pot with a smooth finish
6. A ceramic plate with a floral painted design
7. A stoneware mug with a matte glaze
8. A terracotta planter with geometric patterns
9. A glass vase with a leaf motif
10. A wooden sculpture of a tree
11. A metal bowl with a hammered texture
12. A ceramic tile with a mosaic design
13. A hand-carved wooden bowl
14. A plastic model of a fish
15. A knitted woolen blanket with a leaf pattern
16. A ceramic teapot with a dragon motif
17. A clay sculpture of a human figure
18. A porcelain figurine of a cat
19. A glass sculpture of a wave
20. A ceramic cup with a smooth, glossy finish
21. A metal sculpture of a bird
22. A ceramic tile with a geometric pattern
23. A hand-painted ceramic bowl with abstract designs
24. A clay vase with a traditional Greek design

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
