Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical invariants used to classify or distinguish structures in topology, physics, or abstract systems.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Euler characteristic
2. Winding number
3. Chern number
4. Linking number

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Conservation of energy
6. Golden ratio
7. Fibonacci sequence
8. Speed of light
9. Planck constant
10. Pi
11. Gravitational constant
12. Atomic number
13. Quantum spin
14. Symmetry group
15. Fractal dimension
16. Prime factorization
17. Center of mass
18. Periodic orbit
19. Phase space
20. Vector field
21. Complex plane
22. Metric tensor
23. Wave function
24. Eigenvalue

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
