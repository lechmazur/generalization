Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Microscopic entities that exhibit coordinated movement patterns through chemical signaling

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Myxobacteria aggregating into fruiting bodies
2. Neutrophils migrating towards a site of infection
3. Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae forming slugs
4. Quorum sensing in Vibrio fischeri leading to bioluminescence

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Fish schooling
6. Birds flocking
7. Ants foraging in trails
8. Magnetic nanoparticles aligning in a magnetic field
9. Red blood cells flowing through capillaries
10. Plant roots growing towards water
11. A flock of sheep moving across a field
12. Cancer cells metastasizing
13. Spermatozoa swimming towards an egg
14. Kelp swaying in ocean currents
15. Dust particles moving in air currents
16. Iron filings forming patterns around a magnet
17. A school of krill migrating
18. Bacteria moving towards a food source
19. Paramecia moving towards a light source
20. Slime mold growing on a decaying log
21. Pollen grains carried by the wind
22. Leaves falling from a tree
23. Water molecules evaporating
24. A crowd of people moving through a city street

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
