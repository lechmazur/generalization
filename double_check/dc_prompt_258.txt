Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures built using interlocking or stacked components, designed for both stability and the potential for deliberate disassembly or collapse.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A dry-stone wall
2. A K'NEX model
3. A Jenga tower
4. A card house

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A brick wall with mortar
6. A welded metal sculpture
7. A jigsaw puzzle
8. A chain
9. A rope knot
10. A woven basket
11. A knitted sweater
12. A crocheted blanket
13. A glued wooden chair
14. A nailed birdhouse
15. A spiral staircase
16. A suspension bridge
17. A zipper
18. Velcro
19. A magnetic clasp
20. A snap button
21. A bolt and nut
22. A dovetail joint
23. A mortise and tenon joint
24. A LEGO creation glued together

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
