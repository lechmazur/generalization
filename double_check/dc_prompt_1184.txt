Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Phenomena or systems that experienced a sudden, irreversible collapse due to external intervention or environmental change, leading to their functional or existential end.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The sudden extinction of the passenger pigeon due to overhunting and habitat destruction.
2. The collapse of the Aral Sea ecosystem following the diversion of rivers for irrigation projects.
3. The destruction of the ancient city of Pompeii by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
4. The sudden decline of the Great Barrier Reef due to coral bleaching from rising sea temperatures.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The gradual decline of the Roman Empire over centuries.
6. The seasonal migration of monarch butterflies.
7. The slow erosion of the Grand Canyon by the Colorado River.
8. The annual shedding of leaves by deciduous trees.
9. The transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly.
10. The cyclical phases of the moon.
11. The gradual melting of glaciers over decades.
12. The predictable change of tides due to lunar cycles.
13. The slow adaptation of species through natural selection.
14. The seasonal blooming of cherry blossoms.
15. The gradual urbanization of rural areas.
16. The predictable rotation of the Earth on its axis.
17. The slow rusting of iron when exposed to moisture.
18. The annual migration of birds to warmer climates.
19. The gradual increase in global temperatures due to climate change.
20. The predictable orbit of planets around the sun.
21. The slow desertification of certain regions due to climate change.
22. The gradual buildup of sediment in river deltas.
23. The slow recovery of a forest after a wildfire.
24. The predictable cycle of the seasons.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
