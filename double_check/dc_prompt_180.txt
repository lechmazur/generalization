Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical scientific discoveries made through the use of advanced technological instruments that were first observed in the 21st century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Detection of gravitational waves by LIGO in 2015
2. Observation of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012
3. First image of a black hole captured by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019
4. Discovery of exoplanets using the Kepler Space Telescope in the early 21st century

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Invention of the telescope by Galileo in the 17th century
6. Discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928
7. Development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s
8. First successful cloning of a mammal, Dolly the sheep, in 1996
9. Mapping of the human genome completed in 2003
10. Discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953
11. First moon landing in 1969
12. Invention of the printing press in the 15th century
13. Discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen in 1895
14. First successful heart transplant in 1967
15. Development of the first computer in the mid-20th century
16. Discovery of the electron in 1897
17. First flight of the Wright brothers in 1903
18. Invention of the steam engine in the 18th century
19. Discovery of radioactivity by Marie Curie in the late 19th century
20. First use of anesthesia in surgery in the 19th century
21. Development of the first vaccine for smallpox in 1796
22. Discovery of the neutron in 1932
23. First successful organ transplant in 1954
24. Invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison in the 19th century

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
