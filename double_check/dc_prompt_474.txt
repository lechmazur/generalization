Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer electronics whose primary input mechanism is a circular rotating dial with discrete detents.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Apple iPod Classic
2. Logitech diNovo Mini
3. Griffin Technology's iTrip
4. Behringer DJX750

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphone with touchscreen
6. Laptop with trackpad
7. Tablet with stylus
8. Game console with joystick
9. Digital camera with zoom lever
10. Smartwatch with touch interface
11. Television with remote control
12. Headphones with volume knob
13. Keyboard with scroll wheel
14. Mouse with scroll wheel
15. E-reader with page turn buttons
16. Portable speaker with dial volume control
17. Car stereo with rotary knob
18. Home theater system with remote
19. Drone with joystick controller
20. Virtual reality headset with hand controllers
21. Smart home hub with voice control
22. Fitness tracker with button interface
23. Wireless router with reset button
24. Printer with touch screen panel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
