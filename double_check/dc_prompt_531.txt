Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize a multi-stage cyclical process involving a gaseous phase transition to transport a substance or property.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Refrigeration cycle in a refrigerator
2. Steam engine operation
3. Air conditioning system
4. Geothermal power plant

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Electric fan
6. Hydraulic press
7. Wind turbine
8. Solar panel
9. Battery-powered flashlight
10. Electric motor
11. Hydroelectric dam
12. Combustion engine
13. Microwave oven
14. Fuel cell
15. Electric heater
16. Photovoltaic cell
17. Gasoline engine
18. Windmill
19. Electric kettle
20. Diesel generator
21. Thermal power plant
22. Incandescent light bulb
23. Geothermal heating system
24. Electric stove

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
