Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovative architectural designs that integrate both functional and artistic elements to address social issues

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A building designed with integrated vertical gardens to combat urban heat islands and promote community interaction.
2. A multi-use structure that serves as both a homeless shelter and an art gallery, using recycled materials to highlight sustainability and social issues.
3. An architectural design featuring movable walls that transform public spaces into emergency shelters during natural disasters, also serving as a community hub for cultural events.
4. A school building with an innovative layout that encourages collaborative learning and includes public spaces for community education on social issues like health and environmental awareness.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A skyscraper with a unique glass facade that reflects the surrounding environment.
6. A bridge designed with aesthetic lighting to enhance its visual appeal at night.
7. A museum dedicated to modern art with a focus on interactive exhibits.
8. A residential complex with energy-efficient features like solar panels.
9. A public park designed with sculptures that serve as play structures for children.
10. A community center that hosts workshops on various topics including art and technology.
11. A library with an open floor plan to encourage social interaction among visitors.
12. A shopping mall with a central atrium that hosts seasonal events and performances.
13. A sports stadium with retractable roofs to adapt to different weather conditions.
14. A hotel with rooms designed to maximize natural light and views of the city.
15. A concert hall with acoustics designed to enhance the musical experience.
16. A corporate office building with ergonomic workspaces to improve employee productivity.
17. A university campus with buildings designed to blend with the natural landscape.
18. A hospital with patient rooms that have calming color schemes to promote healing.
19. A restaurant with an open kitchen concept to engage diners in the cooking process.
20. A theater with a flexible seating arrangement to accommodate different types of performances.
21. A public transportation hub with digital displays for real-time travel information.
22. A residential tower with a rooftop garden for residents to enjoy outdoor space.
23. A convention center with modular walls to adapt to different event sizes and layouts.
24. A government building with a design that symbolizes transparency and accessibility to the public.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
