Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures designed for sustained, solitary human observation of a large, open natural space, primarily water.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fire Island Lighthouse
2. Cape Hatteras Lighthouse
3. Pigeon Point Lighthouse
4. Point Arena Lighthouse

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Observatory dome
6. Watchtower in a national park
7. Lifeguard station on a beach
8. Control tower at an airport
9. Treehouse overlooking a forest
10. Mountain cabin with a view of a valley
11. Deck of a cruise ship
12. Balcony overlooking a city park
13. Patio with a view of a garden
14. Roof terrace with a city skyline view
15. Observation deck on a skyscraper
16. Lookout point on a hiking trail
17. Porch facing a lake
18. Window seat in a house with a view of the countryside
19. Veranda overlooking a river
20. Sunroom with a view of a meadow
21. Balcony overlooking a vineyard
22. Deck overlooking a canyon
23. Patio with a view of the mountains
24. Observation platform at a nature reserve

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
