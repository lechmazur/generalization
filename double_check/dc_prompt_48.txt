Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural practices or beliefs involving symbolic representation of a person or entity for the purpose of influencing their perceived well-being or fate, where the representation is acted upon as a proxy for the target.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A voodoo doll used to influence a person's health or fortune.
2. A poppet in witchcraft rituals intended to affect the life of the person it represents.
3. A clay effigy used in a ritual to bring good luck to the person it symbolizes.
4. A wax figure created to protect the individual it represents from harm.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A lucky charm carried for personal good fortune.
6. A prayer said for someone's well-being.
7. A horoscope predicting someone's future.
8. A dreamcatcher hung to protect a person from bad dreams.
9. A talisman worn to ward off evil spirits.
10. A fortune cookie message predicting good luck.
11. A saint's medal worn for protection.
12. A feng shui arrangement to bring prosperity to a household.
13. A mantra chanted for personal peace.
14. A crystal used for healing purposes.
15. A rabbit's foot carried for luck.
16. A palm reading to foresee someone's future.
17. A protective amulet given to a child.
18. A prayer flag hung to spread blessings.
19. A zodiac sign used to describe personality traits.
20. A lucky penny kept in a wallet.
21. A wishbone broken for good luck.
22. A tarot card reading for guidance.
23. A four-leaf clover found for luck.
24. A charm bracelet worn for protection.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
