Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): agricultural systems that utilize water-based land management techniques

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Rice terraces in Southeast Asia
2. Flooded fields for cranberry cultivation
3. Wetland rice farming in Africa
4. Paddy fields in Japan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Irrigation systems in desert agriculture
6. Drip irrigation for vineyards
7. Greenhouse farming with hydroponics
8. Water conservation techniques in arid regions
9. Aquaponics systems
10. Rainwater harvesting for crop irrigation
11. Subsurface drip irrigation in orchards
12. Sprinkler systems for lawn maintenance
13. Water recycling in urban agriculture
14. Fish farming in ponds
15. Canal irrigation in ancient civilizations
16. Water management in hydroelectric dams
17. Swamp-based agriculture in the Amazon
18. Water-efficient crop varieties
19. Artificial lakes for water storage
20. Water purification systems for farming
21. Soil moisture sensors for precision agriculture
22. Water distribution networks in rural areas
23. Water rights and allocation in agriculture
24. Stormwater management in urban farming

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
