Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Films released between 1925-1935 that prominently feature rhythmic visual editing to match musical or mechanical movements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ballet MÃ©canique
2. Berlin: Symphony of a Great City
3. Man with a Movie Camera
4. Enthusiasm: Symphony of the Donbass

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Metropolis
6. The Jazz Singer
7. Modern Times
8. Fantasia
9. The Gold Rush
10. Un Chien Andalou
11. The Broadway Melody
12. 42nd Street
13. Top Hat
14. The Blue Angel
15. Steamboat Willie
16. The Skeleton Dance
17. King Kong
18. The Lost World
19. The Cameraman
20. The General
21. Battleship Potemkin
22. The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
23. Nosferatu
24. The Passion of Joan of Arc

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
