Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Professions that evolved in response to specific societal needs during the Middle Ages

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chirurgeon
2. Scrivener
3. Alchemist
4. Herald

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Blacksmith
6. Carpenter
7. Farmer
8. Merchant
9. Priest
10. Knight
11. Monk
12. Baker
13. Butcher
14. Cobbler
15. Miller
16. Tanner
17. Weaver
18. Barber
19. Apothecary
20. Architect
21. Engineer
22. Jester
23. Minstrel
24. Teacher

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
