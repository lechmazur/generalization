Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or tools specifically designed to help people perform calculations that were widely used before electronic calculators became common

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Slide rule
2. Abacus
3. Napier's bones
4. Mechanical calculator

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Protractor
6. Compass
7. Graphing paper
8. Ruler
9. Set square
10. Pencil
11. Pen
12. Paper
13. Mathematical textbook
14. Logarithm table
15. Trigonometry table
16. Computer
17. Smartphone
18. Spreadsheet software
19. Cash register
20. Adding machine
21. Statistical software
22. Quantum computer
23. Mathematical formula
24. Geoboard

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
