Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Photographic equipment designed to capture images across non-visible light spectrums for scientific analysis

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A cooled CCD camera for astrophotography, capturing near-infrared emissions from nebulae.
2. A multispectral imaging system mounted on a drone, used for agricultural analysis.
3. A UV fluorescence photography setup for documenting forensic evidence.
4. An X-ray microtomography scanner for visualizing the internal structure of insects.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A wide-angle lens for landscape photography.
6. A telephoto lens for wildlife photography.
7. A macro lens for close-up photography.
8. A tripod for camera stability.
9. A camera flash for additional lighting.
10. A light meter for measuring light intensity.
11. A camera bag for carrying equipment.
12. A photo editing software.
13. A studio lighting setup.
14. A portrait lens for capturing people.
15. A smartphone camera.
16. A film camera.
17. A darkroom for developing film.
18. A light box for viewing slides.
19. A digital photo frame.
20. A telescope for visual observation.
21. Binoculars for birdwatching.
22. A microscope for viewing cells.
23. A thermal imaging camera for detecting heat signatures.
24. A night vision camera for seeing in low light.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
