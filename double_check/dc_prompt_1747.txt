Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional crafts using animal hides or skins for functional items

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A pair of leather gloves
2. A leather belt
3. A leather wallet
4. A leather satchel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A woolen scarf
6. A silk tie
7. A cotton shirt
8. A denim jacket
9. A plastic raincoat
10. A metal watch
11. A wooden chair
12. A ceramic vase
13. A glass bottle
14. A rubber boot
15. A nylon backpack
16. A polyester dress
17. A linen tablecloth
18. A velvet curtain
19. A canvas tent
20. A paper notebook
21. A bamboo basket
22. A clay pot
23. A steel knife
24. A copper mug

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
