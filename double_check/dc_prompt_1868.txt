Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geological formations in arid regions that contain significant hydrocarbon deposits and are named after local landmarks or features.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ghawar Field
2. Permian Basin
3. Burgan Field
4. Safaniya Field

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Grand Canyon
6. Painted Desert
7. Monument Valley
8. Death Valley Salt Flats
9. Moab Desert
10. Atacama Salt Flat
11. Sahara Oil Pipeline
12. Arabian Shield
13. Mojave Formation
14. Gobi Desert Basin
15. Red Rock Canyon
16. Valley of Fire
17. Thar Desert Dunes
18. Namib Sand Sea
19. Kalahari Basin
20. Simpson Desert
21. Rub al Khali
22. Great Artesian Basin
23. Colorado Plateau
24. Negev Highland

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
