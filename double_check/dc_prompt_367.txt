Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artifacts or structures directly related to pre-Columbian Mesoamerican rituals involving cyclical astronomical observations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. El Caracol observatory at Chichen Itza
2. The Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan
3. The Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza
4. The Monte Alb√°n astronomical observatory

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Pyramid of Giza
6. The Colosseum in Rome
7. The Parthenon in Athens
8. The Stonehenge in England
9. The Eiffel Tower in Paris
10. The Taj Mahal in India
11. The Machu Picchu in Peru
12. The Acropolis in Athens
13. The Leaning Tower of Pisa
14. The Sphinx in Egypt
15. The Moai statues on Easter Island
16. The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul
17. The Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil
18. The Sydney Opera House
19. The Golden Gate Bridge
20. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai
21. The Great Wall of China
22. The Alhambra in Spain
23. The Petra in Jordan
24. The Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
