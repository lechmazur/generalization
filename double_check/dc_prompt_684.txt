Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places or objects that are designed to facilitate both preservation and interaction with nature

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a botanical garden
2. a wildlife observation deck
3. a nature reserve visitor center
4. a green roof with public access

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a hiking trail
6. a national park
7. a bird feeder
8. a treehouse
9. a camping tent
10. a picnic table
11. a kayak
12. a fishing rod
13. a nature documentary
14. a compost bin
15. a solar panel
16. a wind turbine
17. a recycling bin
18. a water fountain
19. a park bench
20. a birdhouse
21. a garden hose
22. a rain barrel
23. a trail map
24. a pair of binoculars

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
