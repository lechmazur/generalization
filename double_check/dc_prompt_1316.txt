Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that utilize modular, interlocking components to achieve structural integrity or functional adaptability.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. LEGO bricks
2. Pipe fittings and sections
3. Modular furniture systems
4. Bayonet light bulb sockets

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Zipper
6. Velcro
7. Button
8. Shoelaces
9. Chain links
10. Train cars
11. Electrical outlet and plug
12. USB cable and port
13. Screws and nuts
14. Nails
15. Glue
16. Welding
17. Soldering
18. Magnets
19. Rope knot
20. Stack of books
21. Jenga blocks
22. Matryoshka dolls
23. Building scaffolding
24. Tiles

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
