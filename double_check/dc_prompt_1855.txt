Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in mathematical topology named after their discoverers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Möbius strip
2. Klein bottle
3. Hausdorff space
4. Hilbert cube

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Euclidean plane
6. Cartesian coordinate system
7. Pythagorean theorem
8. Golden ratio
9. Fibonacci sequence
10. Pascal's triangle
11. Gaussian distribution
12. Newton's method
13. Euler's formula
14. Riemann hypothesis
15. Fourier transform
16. Laplace's equation
17. Bayes' theorem
18. Markov chain
19. Bernoulli's principle
20. Fermat's last theorem
21. Archimedean spiral
22. Poisson distribution
23. Heisenberg uncertainty principle
24. Schrödinger's equation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
