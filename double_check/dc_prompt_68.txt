Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that were initially developed for military purposes but later found widespread civilian applications

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Global Positioning System (GPS)
2. Drones
3. The Internet
4. Microwave ovens

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The cotton gin
6. The assembly line
7. The steam engine
8. The printing press
9. The telescope
10. The microscope
11. The sewing machine
12. The telephone
13. The light bulb
14. The automobile
15. The airplane
16. The radio
17. The television
18. The computer
19. Nuclear power
20. The laser
21. Kevlar
22. Duct tape
23. Super Glue
24. The jet engine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
