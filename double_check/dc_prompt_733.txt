Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural locations that are shared by two or more countries and have unique endemic species

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Pyrenees Mountains (shared by Spain, France, and Andorra) with endemic species like the Pyrenean desman and the Pyrenean brook salamander
2. The Amazon rainforest (shared by nine South American countries) with endemic species like the Amazon river dolphin and the poison dart frog
3. Lake Titicaca (shared by Peru and Bolivia) with endemic species like the Titicaca water frog and the giant Titicaca grebe
4. The Carpathian Mountains (shared by seven European countries) with endemic species like the Tatra chamois and the Carpathian newt

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Grand Canyon
6. The Sahara Desert
7. The Galapagos Islands
8. The Great Barrier Reef
9. Mount Everest
10. Niagara Falls (shared by US and Canada)
11. The Mediterranean Sea
12. The Danube River
13. The Alps
14. The Himalayas
15. The Serengeti
16. The Okavango Delta
17. The Arctic Circle
18. The Antarctic
19. Lake Victoria
20. The Dead Sea
21. The Black Forest
22. The Redwood Forest
23. The Mekong River
24. The Iguazu Falls

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
