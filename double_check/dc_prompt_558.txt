Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects incorporating traditional handwoven textiles from nomadic cultures into functional, modern medical devices.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A stethoscope with earpieces wrapped in handwoven Berber textiles
2. A wheelchair seat cushion made from traditional Navajo woven patterns
3. An orthopedic brace featuring handwoven Andean fabric
4. A surgical mask with straps made from handwoven Mongolian textiles

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A stethoscope with a leather cover
6. A wheelchair with a leather seat
7. An orthopedic brace with a neoprene lining
8. A surgical mask with elastic straps
9. A hospital bed with a memory foam mattress
10. A crutch with a rubber handle
11. A blood pressure cuff with a nylon exterior
12. A thermometer with a plastic casing
13. A hearing aid with a silicone mold
14. A prosthetic limb with a carbon fiber finish
15. A medical alert bracelet made of stainless steel
16. A CPAP machine with a plastic mask
17. A hospital gown made from cotton
18. A surgical glove made from latex
19. A dental tool with a metal handle
20. A first aid kit with a nylon bag
21. A walker with aluminum frame
22. A defibrillator with a plastic case
23. A medical chart with a paper cover
24. A pill organizer made from plastic

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
