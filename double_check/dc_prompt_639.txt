Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Books that explore the intersection of cultural identity and personal transformation through the lens of a female protagonist's journey in a post-colonial context.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie
2. Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys
3. The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy
4. Nervous Conditions by Tsitsi Dangarembga

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
6. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
7. 1984 by George Orwell
8. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
9. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
10. Moby-Dick by Herman Melville
11. The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood
12. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
13. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho
14. The Road by Cormac McCarthy
15. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
16. Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë
17. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath
18. One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez
19. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini
20. The Color Purple by Alice Walker
21. Beloved by Toni Morrison
22. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins
23. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling
24. The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
