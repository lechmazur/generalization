Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional Sámi objects made from reindeer materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gákti with reindeer leather trim
2. Reindeer antler knife handle
3. Reindeer hide drum
4. Reindeer bone needle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Wooden spoon
6. Seal skin boots
7. Woolen scarf
8. Birch bark basket
9. Silver jewelry
10. Leather belt
11. Woven grass mat
12. Stone axe
13. Clay pot
14. Ivory carving
15. Wooden sled
16. Seal fur hat
17. Woolen mittens
18. Bone fishhook
19. Birch bark canoe
20. Iron knife
21. Feather headdress
22. Stone arrowhead
23. Wool blanket
24. Leather moccasins

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
