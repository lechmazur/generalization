Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that serve as intermediaries between human intention and functional outcome, requiring specialized knowledge or tools to bridge the gap.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a computer programming language
2. a musical score
3. a blueprint
4. a recipe

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a hammer
6. a bicycle
7. a smartphone
8. a screwdriver
9. a paintbrush
10. a car
11. a camera
12. a book
13. a television
14. a chair
15. a piano
16. a knife
17. a lamp
18. a refrigerator
19. a clock
20. a washing machine
21. a bicycle helmet
22. a backpack
23. a pair of glasses
24. a wallet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
