Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Automated manufacturing processes that use pressurized liquid-to-solid phase changes to create their final product

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. injection molding of plastic components
2. 3D printing using photopolymer resins cured by UV light
3. die casting of metal parts using molten alloys
4. fused deposition modeling with thermoplastic filaments

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. CNC machining of metal parts
6. laser cutting of acrylic sheets
7. robotic welding of steel structures
8. waterjet cutting of stone tiles
9. extrusion of aluminum profiles
10. stamping of sheet metal components
11. sintering of powdered metals in additive manufacturing
12. electroplating of metal surfaces
13. sand casting of iron parts
14. forging of steel tools
15. polymer extrusion for plastic pipes
16. glassblowing for artistic sculptures
17. powder coating of metal surfaces
18. vacuum forming of plastic sheets
19. milling of wooden furniture components
20. etching of circuit boards
21. laminating of composite materials
22. embossing of leather goods
23. punching of paper sheets
24. grinding of ceramic tiles

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
