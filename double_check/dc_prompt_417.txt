Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Garments designed for extreme cold weather conditions that incorporate fur, either real or synthetic, as a primary insulating material.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A parka with a detachable hood lined with synthetic fur for added warmth.
2. A winter expedition suit featuring real fox fur around the collar and cuffs to protect against severe cold.
3. A heavy-duty insulated jacket with a full lining of synthetic fur designed for Arctic explorers.
4. A thermal overall with real beaver fur integrated into the torso area for extreme cold weather protection.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A lightweight windbreaker for mild weather.
6. A summer dress made of cotton.
7. A raincoat with a waterproof membrane.
8. A fleece-lined hoodie for casual wear.
9. A down-filled vest for moderate cold.
10. A wool sweater for everyday use.
11. A silk scarf for fashion purposes.
12. A pair of thermal leggings without fur.
13. A ski jacket with synthetic insulation but no fur.
14. A leather jacket for urban style.
15. A poncho for rainy conditions.
16. A tracksuit for athletic activities.
17. A denim jacket for spring weather.
18. A t-shirt for warm climates.
19. A pair of shorts for summer.
20. A blazer for professional attire.
21. A swimsuit for water activities.
22. A pair of gloves without fur lining.
23. A hat made of wool for mild winter days.
24. A pair of boots with a rubber sole for wet conditions.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
