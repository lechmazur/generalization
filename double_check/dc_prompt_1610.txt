Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Trading ports that developed their own hybrid languages which became standardized pidgins or creoles before 1800

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Malacca (Malaysian pidgin)
2. Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka Portuguese creole)
3. Fort Marlborough (Bencoolen pidgin)
4. Hirado (Japanese Pidgin Portuguese)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. London
6. New York City
7. Canton
8. Lisbon
9. Amsterdam
10. Swahili
11. Yiddish
12. Singapore
13. Hong Kong
14. Macao
15. Jakarta
16. Manila
17. Goa
18. Batavia
19. Quebec City
20. Chinook Jargon
21. Mobilian Jargon
22. Mediterranean Lingua Franca
23. Hawai'i Creole English
24. Louisiana Creole

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
