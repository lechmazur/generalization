Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional ceremonies that are made from natural materials and have symbolic geometric patterns

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Navajo woven rug with diamond and zigzag patterns used in healing ceremonies.
2. A Hopi kachina doll carved from cottonwood root and painted with geometric designs representing rain clouds.
3. A woven basket made of sweetgrass and decorated with concentric circles, used in Cherokee harvest festivals.
4. A Maori carved wooden lintel with spiral and triangular patterns adorning a meeting house.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A plastic Christmas ornament
6. A metal menorah
7. A glass rosary
8. A silk prayer shawl
9. A concrete statue of Buddha
10. An electronic singing bowl
11. A printed prayer book
12. A steel church bell
13. A synthetic tapestry depicting a religious scene
14. A plastic crucifix
15. A porcelain doll in traditional costume
16. A gold ring with religious inscription
17. A silver chalice
18. A bronze incense burner
19. A stained glass window depicting a saint
20. A marble altar
21. A clay pot used for cooking
22. A wooden spoon used for stirring food
23. A stone axe head
24. A bone needle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
