Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Dictators who wrote books on their political ideologies while in prison.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler
2. The Green Book by Muammar Gaddafi
3. Prison Diary by Jawaharlal Nehru
4. The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Prince by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli
6. Das Kapital by Karl Marx
7. The Art of War by Sun Tzu
8. Common Sense by Thomas Paine
9. The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
10. 1984 by George Orwell
11. Animal Farm by George Orwell
12. The Republic by Plato
13. Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes
14. The Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau
15. On Liberty by John Stuart Mill
16. The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith
17. Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville
18. The Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay
19. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
20. The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek
21. Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Thomas Piketty
22. The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir
23. Orientalism by Edward Said
24. The Clash of Civilizations by Samuel P. Huntington

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
