Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations that fundamentally altered personal transportation methods in urban environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The introduction of the bicycle-sharing system in cities
2. The implementation of electric scooters as a rental service in urban areas
3. The rise of ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft in metropolitan regions
4. The development of autonomous electric shuttle services in city centers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the steam engine
6. The construction of the first transcontinental railroad
7. The mass production of the automobile
8. The creation of the first airplane
9. The development of high-speed trains
10. The introduction of GPS navigation systems
11. The expansion of public bus networks
12. The establishment of carpooling programs
13. The improvement of urban road infrastructure
14. The implementation of traffic light systems
15. The creation of the first subway system
16. The development of hybrid vehicles
17. The introduction of car-sharing services
18. The invention of the internal combustion engine
19. The expansion of bicycle lanes in cities
20. The development of smart traffic management systems
21. The introduction of congestion pricing in urban areas
22. The creation of pedestrian-only zones in city centers
23. The implementation of electric buses in public transit systems
24. The development of maglev train technology

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
