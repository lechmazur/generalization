Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Celestial objects that exhibit periodic brightness variations due to eclipsing phenomena

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Algol
2. Beta Lyrae
3. W Ursae Majoris
4. CM Draconis

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cepheid variable
6. RR Lyrae variable
7. Mira variable
8. Rotating variable star
9. Pulsar
10. Quasar
11. Supernova
12. Binary star with no eclipses
13. Transit of an exoplanet
14. The Sun
15. The Moon
16. Jupiter
17. Betelgeuse
18. Sirius
19. Proxima Centauri
20. Cataclysmic variable star
21. RS Canum Venaticorum variable
22. T Tauri star
23. Wolf-Rayet star
24. Blazar

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
