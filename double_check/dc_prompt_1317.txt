Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Spaces designed to evoke mystery or secrecy through deliberate use of lighting, architectural elements, or symbolic clutter, often associated with esoteric or ritualistic purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A dimly lit chamber with flickering candlelight, ancient runes carved into the walls, and a central altar draped in black cloth.
2. A labyrinthine library with towering shelves, obscured corners, and a single beam of light illuminating a dusty, open tome.
3. A hidden garden enclosed by high stone walls, overgrown with ivy, and featuring a fountain with cryptic inscriptions.
4. A subterranean vault with low ceilings, faintly glowing symbols on the floor, and scattered artifacts arranged in a circular pattern.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a brightly lit art gallery with modern sculptures
6. a minimalist living room with neutral tones and clean lines
7. a bustling marketplace with colorful stalls and loud vendors
8. a children's playground with swings and slides
9. a sunny beach with umbrellas and sandcastles
10. a corporate office with cubicles and fluorescent lighting
11. a fast-food restaurant with neon signs and plastic seating
12. a sports stadium with floodlights and cheering crowds
13. a hospital room with white walls and medical equipment
14. a shopping mall with glass elevators and escalators
15. a classroom with a chalkboard and rows of desks
16. a train station with timetables and commuters
17. a movie theater with red velvet seats and a large screen
18. a coffee shop with cozy armchairs and latte art
19. a public park with jogging paths and picnic tables
20. a gym with treadmills and weight machines
21. a concert hall with a grand piano and chandeliers
22. a hotel lobby with a reception desk and potted plants
23. a science lab with beakers and microscopes
24. a zoo enclosure with animals and informational signs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
