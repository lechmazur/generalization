Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or systems that integrate natural elements with human-made frameworks to create spaces for contemplation or transformation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A labyrinth constructed of local stones nestled within a grove of trees, designed for meditative walking.
2. A greenhouse chapel with stained glass depicting natural scenes and incorporating living plants into the altar area.
3. An outdoor amphitheater built into a hillside, using natural acoustics and incorporating the surrounding landscape into the performance space.
4. A sweat lodge built with willow branches and covered with animal hides, situated near a flowing stream for ritual purification.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A botanical garden with labeled plants.
6. A zoo enclosure designed to mimic a natural habitat.
7. A rooftop garden on a skyscraper.
8. A park with walking trails and benches.
9. A farm that uses sustainable agriculture practices.
10. A hydroelectric dam generating power from a river.
11. A wind farm on a grassy plain.
12. A solar panel array in the desert.
13. A living wall in an office building.
14. A green burial ground where bodies decompose naturally.
15. A composting toilet that uses natural processes.
16. A nature reserve with designated hiking paths.
17. A wildlife sanctuary for endangered species.
18. An aquarium showcasing marine life.
19. A museum of natural history with exhibits on ecosystems.
20. A biodome replicating various climates and ecosystems.
21. A vertical farm growing crops in a controlled environment.
22. A house built with recycled materials.
23. A bridge spanning a canyon.
24. A tunnel carved through a mountain.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
