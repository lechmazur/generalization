Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): celestial bodies or phenomena that exhibit visible atmospheric or surface features when observed through advanced imaging technologies like augmented reality or holographic systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The intricate cloud bands of Jupiter, revealing detailed atmospheric dynamics
2. The surface texture and polar ice caps of Mars, showcasing geological features
3. The auroral displays on Saturn, highlighting atmospheric phenomena
4. The detailed surface features of the Moon, including craters and maria

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The vast emptiness of space
6. The twinkling of distant stars
7. The trajectory of a comet
8. The phases of Venus
9. The color of a planet's sky
10. The brightness of a supernova
11. The orbit of a satellite
12. The size of a galaxy
13. The temperature of the Sun's surface
14. The density of a neutron star
15. The composition of an asteroid
16. The magnetic field of a planet
17. The rotation period of Mercury
18. The distance between planets
19. The gravitational pull of a black hole
20. The spectrum of light from a star
21. The path of a meteor
22. The age of the universe
23. The expansion rate of the cosmos
24. The classification of a celestial object

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
