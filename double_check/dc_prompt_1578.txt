Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices that separate or sort items through repeated rotating or oscillating motions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a centrifuge used for separating blood components
2. a sifter used for sorting flour and other dry ingredients
3. a trommel screen used for separating different sizes of compost
4. a vibratory bowl feeder used for sorting and orienting small parts in manufacturing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a conveyor belt used for transporting items
6. a washing machine that cleans clothes
7. a blender that mixes ingredients
8. a fan that circulates air
9. a drill that creates holes
10. a pump that moves liquids
11. a mixer that combines substances
12. a shredder that destroys documents
13. a vacuum cleaner that removes dust
14. a lathe that shapes wood or metal
15. a crane that lifts heavy objects
16. a robot arm that performs tasks
17. a conveyor system that sorts packages by size
18. a magnetic separator that removes metal contaminants
19. a filtration system that purifies water
20. a sorting machine that uses optical sensors
21. a device that separates items based on weight
22. a machine that sorts items using air jets
23. a device that separates items using gravity
24. a machine that sorts items using a linear motion

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
