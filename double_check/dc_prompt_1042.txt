Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): technologies or systems that integrate ancient cultural practices with modern automation or machinery

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A robotic arm programmed with traditional weaving patterns to create textiles.
2. A sensor-driven irrigation system based on ancient water harvesting techniques.
3. A CNC machine carving intricate designs based on traditional woodblock printing motifs.
4. A software program using algorithms derived from ancient astrological calculations for modern astronomical predictions.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A 3D printer creating modern art sculptures.
6. A self-driving car navigating using GPS.
7. A smart thermostat regulating home temperature.
8. A drone delivering packages.
9. A virtual reality headset for gaming.
10. A smartphone with facial recognition technology.
11. A solar panel generating electricity.
12. A wind turbine generating electricity.
13. A hydroponic system for growing vegetables.
14. A CRISPR gene editing tool.
15. A telescope observing distant galaxies.
16. A microscope examining microorganisms.
17. A weather satellite predicting storms.
18. A pacemaker regulating heart rhythm.
19. An artificial intelligence composing music.
20. A robot performing surgery.
21. A blockchain securing financial transactions.
22. A quantum computer solving complex problems.
23. A machine learning algorithm predicting consumer behavior.
24. A social media platform connecting people online.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
