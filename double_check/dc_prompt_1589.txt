Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional textile patterns that use diagonal lines to represent rivers or water flow

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a zigzag pattern symbolizing a flowing river
2. a herringbone design representing a meandering stream
3. a chevron motif depicting water currents
4. a diagonal lattice pattern evoking the movement of a river

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a floral embroidery pattern
6. a geometric grid design
7. a paisley print
8. a polka dot fabric
9. a striped textile with vertical lines
10. a plaid fabric with intersecting lines
11. a circular mandala pattern
12. a checkerboard design
13. a wave-like pattern with horizontal curves
14. a spiral motif
15. a leaf-shaped embroidery
16. a star-patterned textile
17. a diamond-shaped lattice
18. a sunburst design
19. a cloud-shaped print
20. a fish-scale pattern
21. a tree silhouette motif
22. a mountain range design
23. a feather-like pattern
24. a butterfly-shaped embroidery

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
