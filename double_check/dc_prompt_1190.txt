Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures that enforce strict hierarchical control to ensure compliance with predefined standards or norms.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a military chain of command
2. a corporate organizational hierarchy
3. a school grading system
4. a legal code enforcement system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a democratic voting process
6. a community garden
7. a peer review system
8. a collaborative art project
9. a decentralized cryptocurrency network
10. a flat organizational structure
11. a brainstorming session
12. a jury deliberation
13. a social media platform
14. a public library
15. a volunteer group
16. a cooperative business
17. a consensus-based decision-making process
18. a neighborhood watch program
19. a crowdfunding campaign
20. a peer-to-peer file-sharing network
21. a town hall meeting
22. a self-governing community
23. a grassroots movement
24. a collaborative research team

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
