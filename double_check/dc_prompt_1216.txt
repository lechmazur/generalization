Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural practices or design elements that symbolically or functionally bridge the living and the non-living, often through rituals, aesthetics, or spatial arrangements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Japanese tokonoma alcove
2. An Egyptian tomb's false door
3. A DÃ­a de los Muertos ofrenda
4. A Tibetan sky burial platform

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A church steeple
6. A garden fountain
7. A meditation labyrinth
8. A sundial
9. A wedding arch
10. A museum display case
11. A sacred grove
12. A stone circle
13. A prayer wheel
14. A ceremonial mask
15. A temple bell
16. A memorial bench
17. A wishing well
18. A peace pole
19. A victory arch
20. A sacred spring
21. A ritual drum
22. A sanctuary lamp
23. A prayer flag
24. A ceremonial gateway

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
