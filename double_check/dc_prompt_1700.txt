Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical conjectures that were initially proposed to solve an unrelated problem but ended up having major implications in a different branch of mathematics

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fermat's Last Theorem
2. Riemann Hypothesis
3. Poincaré Conjecture
4. Langlands Program

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Goldbach's Conjecture
6. Collatz Conjecture
7. Four Color Theorem
8. Kepler Conjecture
9. ABC Conjecture
10. Twin Prime Conjecture
11. Hodge Conjecture
12. Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
13. Beal's Conjecture
14. Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness
15. Continuum Hypothesis
16. Andrews-Curtis Conjecture
17. Hilbert's Tenth Problem
18. Riemann Mapping Theorem
19. Banach-Tarski Paradox
20. Monty Hall Problem
21. Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems
22. Russell's Paradox
23. Banach's Fixed Point Theorem
24. Ramsey Theory

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
