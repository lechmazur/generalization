Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Processes that involve the transformation of chaotic systems into structured, predictable patterns through iterative refinement.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The formation of snowflakes from water vapor in the atmosphere.
2. The development of a mature forest from a random distribution of seeds.
3. The emergence of stable planetary orbits from a chaotic protoplanetary disk.
4. The crystallization of metals from a molten state into a structured lattice.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The organization of a library's book collection by genre and author.
6. The process of urban planning to design city layouts.
7. The sorting of data in a computer algorithm.
8. The training of a neural network to recognize patterns.
9. The evolution of species through natural selection.
10. The creation of a schedule for a school's classes.
11. The development of a company's organizational structure.
12. The process of writing a novel from an outline.
13. The formation of a political party from a group of individuals.
14. The establishment of traffic flow patterns in a city.
15. The creation of a musical composition from a set of notes.
16. The process of cooking a meal from a recipe.
17. The development of a software program from a set of requirements.
18. The organization of a team's strategy in a sports game.
19. The process of assembling a puzzle from its pieces.
20. The creation of a painting from a blank canvas.
21. The development of a garden from a plot of land.
22. The process of learning a new language through structured lessons.
23. The organization of a filing system in an office.
24. The creation of a sculpture from a block of marble.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
