Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Archaeological sites or cultural landmarks that feature prominently in fictional narratives or mythologies, blending historical reality with imaginative storytelling.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Glastonbury Tor
2. Oracle of Delphi
3. Tintagel Castle
4. Temple of Artemis at Ephesus

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Great Wall of China
6. Stonehenge
7. Machu Picchu
8. The Parthenon
9. Easter Island
10. Petra
11. The Sphinx
12. Angkor Wat
13. Mount Olympus
14. Tower of London
15. Chichen Itza
16. Pompeii
17. Notre Dame Cathedral
18. Taj Mahal
19. Colosseum
20. Acropolis
21. Pyramids of Giza
22. Hadrian's Wall
23. Aztec Templo Mayor
24. Palace of Knossos

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
