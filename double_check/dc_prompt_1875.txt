Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Religious practices originating in the Caribbean that incorporate African spiritual traditions and have spread internationally.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Santería rituals involving Orisha worship
2. Haitian Vodou ceremonies honoring the Loa
3. Obeah practices involving spiritual healing and protection
4. Palo Mayombe rituals centered on ancestral spirits

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Buddhist meditation practices
6. Christian baptism ceremonies
7. Native American sweat lodge rituals
8. Hindu puja offerings to deities
9. Islamic Ramadan fasting
10. Shinto shrine visits in Japan
11. Wiccan moon rituals
12. Jewish Passover Seder
13. Zoroastrian fire temple ceremonies
14. Ancient Greek oracle consultations
15. Egyptian mummification practices
16. Mayan bloodletting rituals
17. Celtic druidic ceremonies
18. Australian Aboriginal Dreamtime stories
19. Inuit shamanic drumming
20. Maori haka performances
21. Rastafarian Nyabinghi drumming
22. African tribal initiation rites
23. Brazilian Candomblé ceremonies
24. Korean shamanic gut rituals

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
