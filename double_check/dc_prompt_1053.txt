Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or human-made structures that rely on the accumulation or erosion of material over time to achieve their form or function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stalactites in caves
2. Beaches formed by wave action
3. Coral reefs built by coral polyps
4. Arches in sandstone formations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bridges constructed from steel and concrete
6. Skyscrapers built with modern materials
7. Damns built to control water flow
8. Wind turbines designed for energy generation
9. Solar panels installed on rooftops
10. Highways paved for transportation
11. Airplanes designed for flight
12. Submarines built for underwater exploration
13. Artificial islands constructed in the sea
14. Canals dug for navigation
15. Tunnels bored through mountains
16. Levees built to prevent flooding
17. Water treatment plants designed for purification
18. Landfills engineered for waste disposal
19. Greenhouses built for plant cultivation
20. Zoos constructed for animal habitats
21. Amusement parks designed for entertainment
22. Stadiums built for sports events
23. Museums designed to house exhibits
24. Libraries built to store books

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
