Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural practices or art forms that originated as acts of resistance or reclamation against dominant systems of power or oppression.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Capoeira
2. Graffiti art
3. Hip-hop music
4. Quilting in African American communities

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ballet
6. Opera
7. Classical painting
8. Jazz music
9. Rock and roll
10. Modern dance
11. Impressionist art
12. Country music
13. Renaissance sculpture
14. Symphony orchestra
15. Pop music
16. Abstract expressionism
17. Folk music
18. Baroque architecture
19. Film noir
20. Romantic poetry
21. Electronic dance music
22. Surrealist art
23. Musical theater
24. Reggae music

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
