Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): natural or engineered systems that rely on layered structures to achieve functionality or stability

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a gecko's foot with its hierarchical adhesive structures
2. a multilayer optical film used in reflective coatings
3. a sedimentary rock formation with distinct strata
4. a composite material with alternating layers of fiber and resin

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a suspension bridge
6. a honeycomb structure
7. a sponge
8. a tree trunk
9. a spider web
10. a coral reef
11. a snowflake
12. a beehive
13. a chain-link fence
14. a zipper
15. a bicycle wheel
16. a brick wall
17. a DNA double helix
18. a bird's nest
19. a sand dune
20. a crystal lattice
21. a woven fabric
22. a suspension bridge cable
23. a leaf venation pattern
24. a honeycomb sandwich panel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
