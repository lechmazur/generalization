Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Films directed by individuals who have also served as university professors in the field of film studies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Do the Right Thing
2. Blue Velvet
3. The Piano
4. Boyhood

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Inception
6. Avatar
7. Jurassic Park
8. The Godfather
9. Star Wars
10. Forrest Gump
11. The Shawshank Redemption
12. Pulp Fiction
13. The Dark Knight
14. Gladiator
15. Schindler's List
16. La La Land
17. Mad Max: Fury Road
18. Black Panther
19. Parasite
20. Gravity
21. Interstellar
22. Frozen
23. The Lion King
24. Titanic

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
