Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or artifacts that have been physically altered or marked by a significant historical event or figure, leaving a verifiable trace of their interaction.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The microphone used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his "I Have a Dream" speech, showing wear marks from his hands
2. A bullet-damaged helmet from the Battle of Normandy
3. John Lennon's glasses with his fingerprints preserved
4. The flag that flew at Fort McHenry during the battle that inspired the Star-Spangled Banner, showing battle damage

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Napoleon's hat
6. The Declaration of Independence
7. George Washington's sword
8. The Liberty Bell
9. A Roman gladiator's shield
10. The Rosetta Stone
11. Abraham Lincoln's top hat
12. The Wright brothers' first airplane
13. Leonardo da Vinci's notebook
14. Marie Antoinette's jewelry
15. The Hope Diamond
16. Einstein's chalkboard
17. The Crown Jewels
18. Christopher Columbus's compass
19. Cleopatra's mirror
20. Mozart's piano
21. The first Apple computer
22. Shakespeare's quill
23. Joan of Arc's armor
24. Benjamin Franklin's glasses

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
