Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems of organizing information that originated in ancient Mesopotamia and are still actively used in modified forms today

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system
2. The zodiac and its division into 12 signs
3. The cuneiform script
4. The lunar calendar system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The decimal (base-10) numeral system
6. The Gregorian calendar
7. The alphabet
8. The Dewey Decimal Classification system
9. The binary (base-2) numeral system
10. The Chinese lunar calendar
11. The hieroglyphic script
12. The Julian calendar
13. The hexadecimal (base-16) numeral system
14. The Library of Congress Classification system
15. The Mayan calendar
16. The octal (base-8) numeral system
17. The International Phonetic Alphabet
18. The Aztec calendar
19. The Morse code
20. The Braille system
21. The vigesimal (base-20) numeral system
22. The Universal Decimal Classification system
23. The Egyptian calendar
24. The binary-coded decimal system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
