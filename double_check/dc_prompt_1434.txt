Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mass-produced items that became valuable collector pieces primarily due to their packaging rather than their contents

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. 1980s McDonald's Happy Meal toys in their original packaging
2. Vintage Barbie dolls with unopened boxes from the 1960s
3. First edition Pok√©mon cards in their original booster packs
4. Early edition Star Wars action figures in mint condition packaging

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Antique furniture pieces that have increased in value over time
6. Rare coins that are valuable due to their minting errors
7. Classic cars that have become collector's items due to their rarity
8. First edition books that are valuable due to their historical significance
9. Vintage wine bottles that have increased in value due to their age
10. Original artwork by famous artists that have appreciated in value
11. Retro video game consoles that are sought after by collectors
12. Designer handbags that have become valuable due to their brand prestige
13. Rare stamps that are valuable due to their limited production
14. Antique jewelry pieces that have increased in value due to their craftsmanship
15. Collectible comic books that are valuable due to their rarity and condition
16. Vintage musical instruments that have appreciated in value over time
17. Rare vinyl records that are sought after by audiophiles
18. Antique watches that have become valuable due to their historical significance
19. Collectible sports memorabilia that are valuable due to their association with famous athletes
20. Vintage cameras that have increased in value due to their technological significance
21. Rare beer cans that are sought after by collectors due to their unique designs
22. Antique quilts that have become valuable due to their craftsmanship and historical significance
23. Collectible figurines that are valuable due to their limited edition status
24. Vintage advertising signs that have increased in value due to their nostalgic appeal

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
