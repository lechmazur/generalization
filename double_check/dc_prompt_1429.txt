Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Organisms or structures that create self-sustaining underground networks to distribute resources across multiple connected nodes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. mycorrhizal fungi networks connecting tree roots
2. subterranean ant colonies with interconnected chambers
3. underground fungal networks distributing nutrients in forests
4. root systems of clonal plants like aspen trees sharing resources

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a beehive
6. a coral reef
7. a spider web
8. a river delta
9. a subway system
10. a power grid
11. a computer network
12. a highway system
13. a telephone network
14. a food web
15. a social media network
16. a neural network
17. a supply chain
18. a railway network
19. a water distribution system
20. a lymphatic system
21. a circulatory system
22. a postal service network
23. a trade route
24. a satellite network

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
