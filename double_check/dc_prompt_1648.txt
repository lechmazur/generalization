Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical compositions that use identical-sounding words with different meanings as their primary lyrical device

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. "I Can See Clearly Now" by Johnny Nash
2. "Right Here, Right Now" by Jesus Jones
3. "Why Why Why" by Billy Currington
4. "The Way That You Love Me" by Paula Abdul

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. "Yesterday" by The Beatles
6. "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen
7. "Sweet Dreams" by Eurythmics
8. "Like a Rolling Stone" by Bob Dylan
9. "Purple Rain" by Prince
10. "Dancing Queen" by ABBA
11. "Bridge Over Troubled Water" by Simon & Garfunkel
12. "Imagine" by John Lennon
13. "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd
14. "Born to Run" by Bruce Springsteen
15. "Hotel California" by Eagles
16. "Stairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin
17. "Like a Prayer" by Madonna
18. "Sweet Child O' Mine" by Guns N' Roses
19. "Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana
20. "Every Breath You Take" by The Police
21. "Piano Man" by Billy Joel
22. "American Woman" by The Guess Who
23. "Brown Eyed Girl" by Van Morrison
24. "Sweet Caroline" by Neil Diamond

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
