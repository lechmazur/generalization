Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or structures designed for human use that incorporate a non-electronic feedback mechanism to regulate a continuous physical process.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. toilet tank float valve
2. mechanical thermostat with bimetallic strip
3. pressure cooker release valve
4. ball float steam trap

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. digital thermostat
6. light switch
7. doorbell
8. electronic pressure sensor
9. smoke detector
10. water meter
11. manual water pump
12. sundial
13. mechanical clock
14. wind chime
15. weathervane
16. manual can opener
17. hand drill
18. bicycle gear shifter
19. door closer
20. mousetrap
21. mechanical scale
22. egg timer
23. compass
24. water wheel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
