Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices invented before 1700 that measure atmospheric pressure

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Torricellian barometer
2. Water barometer
3. Vernier barometer
4. Boyle's Statical Baroscope

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Thermometer
6. Hydrometer
7. Anemometer
8. Rain gauge
9. Compass
10. Telescope
11. Microscope
12. Pendulum clock
13. Sextant
14. Astrolabe
15. Slide rule
16. Manometer
17. Vacuum pump
18. Air pump
19. Hygrometer
20. Pyrometer
21. Galvanometer
22. Barograph
23. Altimeter
24. Bourdon tube pressure gauge

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
