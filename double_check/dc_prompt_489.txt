Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or devices designed to expose food to smoke for preservation or flavor enhancement, utilizing a chamber or enclosed space and a low-temperature heat source, excluding dedicated ovens or grills.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cold smoker
2. Hot smoker
3. Smokehouse
4. Pellet smoker

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Barbecue grill
6. Oven
7. Charcoal grill
8. Gas grill
9. Rotisserie
10. Convection oven
11. Microwave oven
12. Toaster oven
13. Broiler
14. Smokeless grill
15. Outdoor kitchen
16. Fire pit
17. Campfire cooking setup
18. Wood-fired pizza oven
19. Smoking gun for cocktails
20. Indoor electric grill
21. Portable camping stove
22. Commercial kitchen range
23. Deep fryer
24. Sous vide cooker

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
