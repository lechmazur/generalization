Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Biological or medical visualization techniques that rely on crossing or interweaving patterns to reveal hidden information

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Connectogram showing brain regions and their interconnections
2. Visualization of overlapping gene expression patterns in different cell types using Venn diagrams
3. Tractography depicting white matter fiber tracts intersecting in the brain
4. Confocal microscopy image of interwoven cytoskeletal filaments

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Heatmap of gene expression levels
6. 3D model of a protein structure
7. Scatter plot of patient data
8. MRI image of the brain
9. Phylogenetic tree
10. Flow cytometry dot plot
11. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
12. Illustration of a biological pathway
13. Microscopic image of a cell
14. X-ray image of a bone fracture
15. Animation of protein folding
16. Graph of population growth
17. Medical illustration of the human heart
18. Time-lapse microscopy of cell division
19. Chladni patterns visualizing sound waves
20. Network diagram of protein-protein interactions
21. Bar chart of disease prevalence
22. Topographic map of brain activity
23. Diagram of the circulatory system
24. Illustration of DNA replication

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
