Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or technologies that utilize a structured form of resource allocation or signal distribution to optimize efficiency and control within a defined network or community.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a traffic light system that uses real-time data to adjust signal timing based on vehicle flow
2. a smart grid that dynamically allocates electricity to households based on demand and availability
3. a ride-sharing app that optimizes driver routes and passenger pickups to minimize wait times
4. a warehouse management system that allocates resources and schedules tasks to maximize efficiency

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a water filtration system
6. a solar panel array
7. a wind turbine
8. a bicycle-sharing station
9. a public library
10. a vending machine
11. a GPS navigation device
12. a weather forecasting app
13. a fitness tracker
14. a home security system
15. a drone delivery service
16. a self-driving car
17. a smart thermostat
18. a video streaming platform
19. a social media network
20. a cloud storage service
21. a cryptocurrency mining rig
22. a 3D printer
23. a virtual reality headset
24. a voice-activated assistant

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
