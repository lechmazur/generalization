Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical compositions inspired by bodies of water that incorporate non-Western instruments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Debussy's "La Mer" performed with a koto
2. Vaughan Williams's "A Sea Symphony" with a sitar
3. Ravel's "Une barque sur l'océan" featuring a tabla
4. Britten's "Four Sea Interludes" with a duduk

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata"
6. Vivaldi's "The Four Seasons"
7. Chopin's "Raindrop Prelude"
8. Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture"
9. Mozart's "Eine kleine Nachtmusik"
10. Bach's "Brandenburg Concertos"
11. Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring"
12. Schubert's "Ave Maria"
13. Handel's "Messiah"
14. Puccini's "La Bohème"
15. Verdi's "Aida"
16. Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries"
17. Mahler's "Symphony No. 5"
18. Brahms's "Hungarian Dances"
19. Liszt's "Hungarian Rhapsodies"
20. Prokofiev's "Peter and the Wolf"
21. Shostakovich's "Symphony No. 7"
22. Rachmaninoff's "Piano Concerto No. 2"
23. Sibelius's "Finlandia"
24. Grieg's "Peer Gynt Suite"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
