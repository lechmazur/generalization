Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that were significantly altered or reconstructed due to fire damage in the 21st century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Reichstag building in Berlin, Germany, which underwent significant reconstruction after a fire in 1933, with major renovations completed in the early 21st century.
2. The Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, which suffered a major fire in 2019 and is currently undergoing extensive restoration.
3. The Glasgow School of Art in Scotland, which was severely damaged by fires in 2014 and 2018, leading to ongoing reconstruction efforts.
4. The Shuri Castle in Okinawa, Japan, which was destroyed by fire in 2019 and is being reconstructed.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A building that was demolished and rebuilt in the 20th century due to structural issues.
6. A historic monument that underwent routine maintenance in the 21st century.
7. A skyscraper that was renovated for modernization purposes in the 21st century.
8. A bridge that was reconstructed after being damaged by a natural disaster in the 20th century.
9. A museum that was expanded in the 21st century to accommodate more exhibits.
10. A castle that was restored in the 20th century after years of neglect.
11. A library that was rebuilt in the 21st century to meet new safety standards.
12. A theater that was renovated in the 21st century to improve acoustics.
13. A government building that was reconstructed in the 20th century due to political changes.
14. A sports stadium that was rebuilt in the 21st century to increase seating capacity.
15. A shopping mall that was renovated in the 21st century to attract more customers.
16. A hotel that was reconstructed in the 20th century after being damaged by a hurricane.
17. A university building that was expanded in the 21st century to accommodate more students.
18. A factory that was rebuilt in the 20th century after being destroyed by an explosion.
19. A church that was renovated in the 21st century to preserve its historical features.
20. A train station that was reconstructed in the 20th century to improve transportation efficiency.
21. A hospital that was expanded in the 21st century to provide more medical services.
22. A residential building that was renovated in the 21st century to meet new energy efficiency standards.
23. An airport terminal that was rebuilt in the 20th century to handle increased traffic.
24. A cultural center that was reconstructed in the 21st century to host larger events.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
