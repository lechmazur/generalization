Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that mimic ancient cultural artifacts in their design or function

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A modern smartphone with a flip design reminiscent of ancient folding fans
2. A smartwatch with a circular face inspired by ancient sundials
3. A digital camera designed to look like an ancient telescope
4. A wireless speaker shaped like an ancient amphora

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A car with a touchscreen interface
6. A drone used for aerial photography
7. A virtual reality headset
8. A 3D printer
9. A smartwatch with fitness tracking
10. A smartphone with facial recognition
11. A robot vacuum cleaner
12. A smart home thermostat
13. A wireless charging pad
14. A laptop with a touch screen
15. A digital assistant device
16. A smart refrigerator with inventory tracking
17. A fitness tracker
18. A smart light bulb
19. A noise-canceling headphone
20. A smart lock for doors
21. A portable solar charger
22. A smart water bottle
23. A GPS navigation system
24. A smart gardening system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
