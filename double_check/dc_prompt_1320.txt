Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or mythological figures whose names or identities are derived from or associated with geometric patterns or optical illusions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Escher's Relativity
2. Penrose Triangle
3. Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man
4. Vasarely's Zebra

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Venus de Milo
6. Michelangelo's David
7. Rodin's The Thinker
8. Monet's Water Lilies
9. Picasso's Guernica
10. Van Gogh's Starry Night
11. Rembrandt's Night Watch
12. Da Vinci's Mona Lisa
13. Hokusai's The Great Wave
14. Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans
15. Goya's Saturn Devouring His Son
16. Botticelli's The Birth of Venus
17. Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel Ceiling
18. Raphael's School of Athens
19. Caravaggio's The Calling of St Matthew
20. Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring
21. Pollock's No. 5, 1948
22. Klimt's The Kiss
23. Frida Kahlo's The Two Fridas
24. Salvador Dal√≠'s The Persistence of Memory

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
