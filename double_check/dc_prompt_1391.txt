Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations that required workers to develop new physical symptoms or conditions to master the technology

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Typing on early typewriters leading to "glass arm" or repetitive strain injuries
2. Operating early steam-powered machinery causing "boilermaker's deafness" due to noise exposure
3. Using early pneumatic drills resulting in "vibration white finger" or hand-arm vibration syndrome
4. Working with early telegraph systems causing "telegrapher's cramp" from repetitive hand movements

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Driving a car
6. Using a smartphone
7. Watching television
8. Listening to the radio
9. Flying an airplane
10. Riding a bicycle
11. Playing a piano
12. Using a modern computer
13. Operating a forklift
14. Playing video games
15. Using a microwave oven
16. Driving a train
17. Using a washing machine
18. Riding a horse
19. Using a chainsaw
20. Playing a guitar
21. Using a lawnmower
22. Operating a crane
23. Using a sewing machine
24. Playing a trumpet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
