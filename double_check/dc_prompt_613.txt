Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer electronics released in Japan between 1997 and 2003 that utilized a MiniDisc drive.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sony MZ-R50 Portable MiniDisc Recorder
2. Sharp MD-MT15 MiniDisc Player
3. Panasonic SJ-MJ50 MiniDisc Player
4. Aiwa AM-F70 MiniDisc Player

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Apple iPod Classic
6. Sony Walkman Cassette Player
7. Nintendo Game Boy Advance
8. Canon PowerShot Digital Camera
9. Panasonic DVD Player
10. Sony PlayStation 2
11. Sharp Aquos LCD TV
12. Casio G-Shock Watch
13. Toshiba Satellite Laptop
14. Hitachi Plasma TV
15. JVC VHS Camcorder
16. Pioneer Car Stereo
17. Fujifilm Instax Camera
18. Nikon Coolpix Camera
19. Seiko Kinetic Watch
20. Epson Inkjet Printer
21. Olympus Digital Voice Recorder
22. Yamaha Portable Keyboard
23. LG DVD Recorder
24. Roland Digital Piano

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
