Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or systems that transition from a state of active functionality to a state of passive preservation or decay, where the transition is irreversible without external intervention

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a fallen tree becoming petrified wood
2. a fresh flower being pressed in a book
3. an abandoned mine filling with groundwater
4. a living coral reef bleaching and dying

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a melting ice cube
6. a rusting bicycle
7. a charging battery
8. a growing plant
9. a healing wound
10. a painted wall
11. a flowing river
12. a burning candle
13. a spinning top
14. a boiling pot of water
15. a pendulum clock
16. a fermenting barrel of wine
17. a composting pile
18. a developing photograph
19. a ripening fruit
20. an eroding cliff
21. a deflating balloon
22. a breaking wave
23. a crackling fire
24. a setting sun

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
