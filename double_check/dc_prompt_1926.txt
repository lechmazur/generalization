Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical artifacts featuring luminescent inscriptions used for ceremonial purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ancient Egyptian scarab amulet with phosphorescent hieroglyphs
2. Mayan ceremonial jade mask with light-emitting crystal inlays
3. Roman temple tablet with bioluminescent algae-based markings
4. Celtic ritual stone with naturally fluorescent mineral text

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Rosetta Stone
6. Ancient sundial
7. Greek amphora
8. Viking runestone
9. Bronze Age ceremonial dagger
10. Aztec calendar stone
11. Chinese oracle bones
12. Persian cuneiform tablet
13. Medieval illuminated manuscript
14. Ancient Roman oil lamp
15. Sumerian clay cylinder seal
16. Buddhist prayer wheel
17. Egyptian canopic jar
18. Prehistoric cave painting
19. Incan quipu
20. Stone Age ceremonial beads
21. Ancient Greek temple column
22. Babylonian star chart
23. Native American totem pole
24. African tribal mask

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
