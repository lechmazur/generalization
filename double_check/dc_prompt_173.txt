Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in outdoor activities that can be carried in a backpack and have a primary function involving fire or heat.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a portable camping stove
2. a firestarter kit
3. a heat-reflective emergency blanket
4. a thermos for hot beverages

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a hiking pole
6. a water bottle
7. a flashlight
8. a compass
9. a sleeping bag
10. a tent
11. a first aid kit
12. a multi-tool
13. a map
14. a whistle
15. a rain jacket
16. a pair of binoculars
17. a camera
18. a notebook
19. a pair of gloves
20. a headlamp
21. a solar charger
22. a bug spray
23. a folding chair
24. a portable fan

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
