Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that fundamentally altered human interaction with natural resources

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The invention of the steam engine
2. The development of hydraulic fracturing (fracking)
3. The creation of the Haber-Bosch process for nitrogen fixation
4. The introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the printing press
6. The development of the internet
7. The creation of the smartphone
8. The introduction of social media platforms
9. The invention of the airplane
10. The development of nuclear power
11. The creation of the electric battery
12. The introduction of renewable energy technologies
13. The invention of the personal computer
14. The development of artificial intelligence
15. The creation of the assembly line
16. The introduction of robotics in manufacturing
17. The invention of the microscope
18. The development of satellite technology
19. The creation of the global positioning system (GPS)
20. The introduction of 3D printing
21. The invention of the telegraph
22. The development of the combustion engine
23. The creation of the refrigerator
24. The introduction of virtual reality technology

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
