Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that were initially developed for military use but later adapted for civilian environmental sustainability applications

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. GPS tracking systems repurposed for wildlife migration monitoring
2. Infrared imaging technology adapted for detecting building energy leaks
3. Drone technology converted for forest fire detection
4. Satellite communications systems modified for remote environmental sensing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Solar panels for residential homes
6. Electric vehicles for personal transportation
7. Wind turbines for power generation
8. Military radar systems
9. Internet communication protocols
10. Recycling machinery
11. Weather monitoring stations
12. Geothermal heating systems
13. Water purification plants
14. Combat vehicles
15. Surveillance cameras
16. Nuclear power plants
17. Smart home technology
18. Battlefield communication devices
19. Composting systems
20. Air quality monitors
21. Military grade computers
22. Hydroelectric dams
23. Tactical gear
24. Waste management facilities

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
