Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Volcanic landforms that contain lakes formed by glacial meltwater

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lake Öskjuvatn in Iceland
2. Lake Taupo in New Zealand
3. Lake Towada in Japan
4. Lake Þórisvatn in Iceland

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Crater Lake in Oregon
6. Lake Kivu in Rwanda
7. Lake Nyos in Cameroon
8. Lake Pinatubo in Philippines
9. Mount Fuji
10. Kilauea Caldera
11. Lake Louise in Canada
12. Laguna Verde in Bolivia
13. Mount Aso crater
14. Lake Atitlan in Guatemala
15. Mount St. Helens crater
16. Lake Myvatn in Iceland
17. Santorini Caldera
18. Lake Mashu in Japan
19. Mount Tambora crater
20. Lake Toba in Indonesia
21. Moraine Lake in Canada
22. Lake Superior
23. Lake Rotorua in New Zealand
24. Emerald Lake in Canada

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
