Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations that are historically significant due to their association with legendary or mythical female figures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The island of Avalon, associated with the legendary figure of Morgan le Fay
2. The city of Troy, linked to the mythical figure of Helen of Troy
3. The river Styx, connected to the mythical figure of Persephone
4. The forest of Broc√©liande, associated with the legendary figure of Viviane, the Lady of the Lake

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Colosseum in Rome, associated with gladiatorial combat
6. The Great Wall of China, a symbol of ancient Chinese military defense
7. The Pyramids of Giza, linked to the pharaohs of ancient Egypt
8. The Acropolis in Athens, associated with the goddess Athena
9. Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument in England
10. The Taj Mahal, a mausoleum in India built by Shah Jahan
11. The Eiffel Tower, a symbol of Paris and French innovation
12. The Statue of Liberty, a symbol of freedom in New York City
13. The Parthenon, a temple dedicated to Athena in Athens
14. The Sistine Chapel, known for Michelangelo's ceiling paintings
15. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, a freestanding bell tower in Italy
16. The Forbidden City, the Chinese imperial palace in Beijing
17. Machu Picchu, an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains
18. The Hagia Sophia, a former church and mosque in Istanbul
19. The Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World
20. The Palace of Versailles, a symbol of French royal power
21. The Sydney Opera House, an iconic building in Australia
22. The Kremlin, a fortified complex in Moscow
23. The Chichen Itza, a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya
24. The Petra, an ancient city in Jordan known for its rock-cut architecture

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
