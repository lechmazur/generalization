Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine a natural element with a human-made structure to create a functional or symbolic duality.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. windmill
2. sundial
3. lighthouse
4. rain garden

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. stone wall
6. wooden bridge
7. glass building
8. metal sculpture
9. garden path
10. concrete dam
11. brick fireplace
12. steel tower
13. marble fountain
14. copper statue
15. clay pot
16. bamboo fence
17. rock garden
18. iron gate
19. ceramic tile
20. timber cabin
21. slate roof
22. bronze bell
23. granite monument
24. silver mirror

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
