Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): large-scale public works projects completed in the late 19th century that symbolize national values or ideals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Brooklyn Bridge
2. Eiffel Tower
3. Trans-Siberian Railway
4. Statue of Liberty

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. World's Columbian Exposition
6. Palace of Fine Arts (San Francisco)
7. Tower Bridge
8. Flatiron Building
9. Hoover Dam
10. Panama Canal
11. Golden Gate Bridge
12. Empire State Building
13. Crystal Palace
14. Suez Canal
15. Canadian Pacific Railway
16. Washington Monument
17. Lincoln Memorial
18. Colosseum
19. Great Wall of China
20. Pyramids of Giza
21. Taj Mahal
22. Machu Picchu
23. Angkor Wat
24. Hagia Sophia

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
