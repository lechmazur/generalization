Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Transparent or translucent organisms that create shifting patterns of colored light through their natural movements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Certain species of jellyfish that display iridescent colors when they move through the water
2. Some types of squid that change colors and create light patterns as they swim
3. Certain comb jellies that refract light into rainbow patterns as they move
4. Some species of deep-sea fish that have bioluminescent organs creating shifting light patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stained glass windows that change color with the movement of the sun
6. Disco balls that reflect and scatter light in various directions
7. Chameleons that change color based on their environment and mood
8. Iridescent beetle wings that shimmer in the light
9. Soap bubbles that create rainbow patterns when they move
10. Peacock feathers that display vibrant colors when the bird moves
11. Oil slicks on water that create shifting patterns of color
12. Holographic stickers that change appearance with angle of view
13. Light shows at concerts that create dynamic patterns of color
14. Auroras that display shifting patterns of light in the sky
15. Fireworks that create colorful, moving patterns in the night sky
16. Laser light shows that project moving patterns of color
17. LED screens that display changing patterns of light and color
18. Prism glasses that split light into colorful patterns
19. Kaleidoscopes that create shifting patterns of color when turned
20. Iridescent fabrics that change color with movement
21. Opal gemstones that display shifting colors with movement
22. Butterfly wings that shimmer and change color in flight
23. Car paint with color-shifting properties that change with angle
24. Rainbows that appear to shift and move with the observer's position

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
