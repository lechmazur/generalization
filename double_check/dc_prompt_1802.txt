Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ambitious large-scale human habitats designed to overcome environmental challenges

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a floating city designed to withstand rising sea levels
2. a self-sustaining underground colony in a desert
3. a biodome habitat on Mars with closed-loop life support systems
4. a vertical forest city integrated into a mountain range

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a solar-powered car
6. a wind farm in the ocean
7. a recycling plant
8. a green roof on a skyscraper
9. a community garden in an urban area
10. a rainwater harvesting system
11. a geothermal power plant
12. a wildlife sanctuary
13. a carbon capture facility
14. a desalination plant
15. a smart home with energy-efficient appliances
16. a public transportation system powered by renewable energy
17. a vertical farm in a city
18. a flood barrier system
19. a tree-planting initiative in urban areas
20. a coral reef restoration project
21. a zero-waste manufacturing facility
22. a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle
23. a climate-resilient crop variety
24. a biodegradable packaging material

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
