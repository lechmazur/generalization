Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Measurement networks that use mechanical float devices to detect and transmit changes in fluid levels

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Float-operated water level gauge in a reservoir
2. Mechanical float switch in a sump pump system
3. Float-based fuel level sensor in a vehicle's gas tank
4. Float valve in a toilet tank

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ultrasonic water level sensor
6. Pressure transducer in a hydraulic system
7. Radar level measurement system
8. Capacitive level sensor
9. Optical liquid level sensor
10. Conductive level probe
11. Vibrating fork level switch
12. Magnetostrictive level transmitter
13. Guided wave radar level sensor
14. Laser level measurement device
15. Thermal dispersion level switch
16. Piezoelectric level sensor
17. Hydrostatic level sensor
18. Microwave level measurement system
19. Fiber optic level sensor
20. Acoustic level sensor
21. Infrared level sensor
22. Electromagnetic level gauge
23. Smart water meter with IoT connectivity
24. Digital flow meter

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
