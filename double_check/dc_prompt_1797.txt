Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures designed to manage and process waste or unwanted materials in enclosed systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Septic tank
2. Incinerator
3. Composting bin
4. Wastewater treatment plant

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Recycling bin
6. Landfill
7. Garbage truck
8. Trash can
9. Street sweeper
10. Recycling center
11. Dump site
12. Garbage chute
13. Waste collection point
14. Compost pile
15. Recycling depot
16. Transfer station
17. Hazardous waste drop-off
18. Recycling truck
19. Street trash bin
20. Open-air compost heap
21. Public waste bin
22. Garbage disposal unit
23. Recycling facility
24. Waste sorting center

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
