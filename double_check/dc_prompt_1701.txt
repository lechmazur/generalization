Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects traditionally used for meditation or contemplation that incorporate natural materials arranged in precise geometric patterns

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a Zen garden with carefully raked sand and stones
2. a mandala made from colored sand
3. a crystal grid arranged in a sacred geometric pattern
4. a labyrinth made from stones in a garden

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a yoga mat
6. a meditation cushion
7. a Tibetan singing bowl
8. a scented candle
9. a bonsai tree
10. a dreamcatcher
11. a prayer bead necklace
12. a bamboo flute
13. a waterfall fountain
14. a wind chime
15. a salt lamp
16. a meditation app
17. a yoga block
18. a mindfulness journal
19. a zen koan
20. a meditation bench
21. a mala bracelet
22. a gong
23. a meditation bell
24. a chakra chart

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
