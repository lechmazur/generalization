Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or artifacts built as defensive barriers that have become significant cultural or historical symbols over time

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Great Wall of China
2. Hadrian's Wall
3. The Berlin Wall
4. The Walls of Constantinople

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Eiffel Tower
6. The Statue of Liberty
7. The Colosseum
8. The Pyramids of Giza
9. The Panama Canal
10. The Golden Gate Bridge
11. The Taj Mahal
12. Stonehenge
13. The Parthenon
14. The Forbidden City
15. Machu Picchu
16. The Acropolis
17. The Tower of London
18. The Palace of Versailles
19. The Kremlin
20. The Pentagon
21. The Sydney Opera House
22. The Leaning Tower of Pisa
23. Mount Rushmore
24. The Empire State Building

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
