Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures built on water that serve as transportation hubs

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Venetian Vaporetto Stops
2. Hong Kong Star Ferry Piers
3. Stockholm Archipelago Ferry Terminals
4. Rotterdam Waterbus Stations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Golden Gate Bridge
6. Brooklyn Bridge
7. Panama Canal
8. Hoover Dam
9. Lake Mead Marina
10. Statue of Liberty
11. Alcatraz Island
12. London Eye
13. Niagara Falls
14. Great Barrier Reef
15. Mount Fuji
16. Empire State Building
17. Burj Khalifa
18. Grand Canyon
19. Central Park
20. Amazon Rainforest
21. Great Wall of China
22. Big Ben
23. Colosseum
24. Eiffel Tower

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
