Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical systems that incorporate components designed to minimize noise during operation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a car engine with sound-dampening materials
2. a washing machine with vibration-reducing mounts
3. a computer fan with noise-optimized blades
4. a refrigerator with a quiet compressor system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a jet engine
6. a chainsaw
7. a lawnmower
8. a vacuum cleaner
9. a blender
10. a hairdryer
11. a power drill
12. a motorcycle
13. a leaf blower
14. a jackhammer
15. a helicopter
16. a loudspeaker
17. a train horn
18. a fire alarm
19. a siren
20. a musical instrument
21. a wind turbine
22. a construction crane
23. a factory assembly line
24. a roller coaster

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
