Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Public parks or natural reserves named after colors or color-related phenomena.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Blue Ridge Parkway
2. Emerald Bay State Park
3. Golden Gate Park
4. Silver Falls State Park

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Yellowstone National Park
6. Grand Canyon National Park
7. Central Park
8. Yosemite National Park
9. Rocky Mountain National Park
10. Great Smoky Mountains National Park
11. Acadia National Park
12. Everglades National Park
13. Sequoia National Park
14. Zion National Park
15. Glacier National Park
16. Joshua Tree National Park
17. Olympic National Park
18. Arches National Park
19. Denali National Park
20. Badlands National Park
21. Shenandoah National Park
22. Death Valley National Park
23. Mount Rainier National Park
24. Great Basin National Park

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
