Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures prominently featured in fictional works depicting historical events or figures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Globe Theatre in "Shakespeare in Love"
2. The Palace of Versailles in "The Man in the Iron Mask"
3. The Great Pyramid in "The Ten Commandments"
4. The Roman Colosseum in "Gladiator"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Eiffel Tower
6. The Great Wall of China in a documentary
7. The Empire State Building in "King Kong"
8. The Parthenon ruins today
9. Notre Dame Cathedral in travel guides
10. The Taj Mahal in photographs
11. The Brooklyn Bridge in "Spider-Man"
12. The Pentagon in news footage
13. The Sydney Opera House in tourism ads
14. Mount Rushmore in nature documentaries
15. The Statue of Liberty in disaster movies
16. Big Ben in spy thrillers
17. The Golden Gate Bridge in earthquake films
18. The Kremlin in modern political dramas
19. The Panama Canal in engineering shows
20. The Space Needle in science fiction
21. The Chrysler Building in romance films
22. The Hoover Dam in action movies
23. The CN Tower in urban photography
24. The Gateway Arch in travel shows

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
