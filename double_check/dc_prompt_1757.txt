Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or systems named after geographical locations that serve as hubs for communication or interaction.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Silicon Valley
2. Wall Street
3. Hollywood
4. Broadway

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the Panama Canal
6. the Great Wall of China
7. the Eiffel Tower
8. the Colosseum
9. the Suez Canal
10. the Golden Gate Bridge
11. the Amazon Rainforest
12. the Sahara Desert
13. the Nile River
14. the Himalayas
15. the Statue of Liberty
16. the Pyramids of Giza
17. the Grand Canyon
18. the Great Barrier Reef
19. the Kremlin
20. the Taj Mahal
21. the Acropolis
22. the Dead Sea
23. the Serengeti
24. the Gal√°pagos Islands

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
