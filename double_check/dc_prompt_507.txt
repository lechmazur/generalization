Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artworks permanently installed in outdoor public spaces in Cornwall, England, created by female artists born before 1950.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Mermaid of Zennor by Jessica Turner
2. Sea Forms by Barbara Hepworth
3. Mother and Child by Mary Spencer Watson
4. Birds of Paradise by Wendy Taylor

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Angel of the North by Antony Gormley
6. Another Place by Antony Gormley
7. The Kelpies by Andy Scott
8. Sky Mirror by Anish Kapoor
9. Spiral Jetty by Robert Smithson
10. Cloud Gate by Anish Kapoor
11. Sun Tunnels by Nancy Holt
12. Stonehenge by Unknown
13. The Singing Ringing Tree by Tonkin Liu
14. Gormley's Another Place by Antony Gormley
15. Verity by Damien Hirst
16. Windswept by Diane Maclean
17. Iron:Man by Antony Gormley
18. Folly by Phyllida Barlow
19. Monument to the Unknown Artist by Rachel Whiteread
20. Quantum Cloud by Antony Gormley
21. Time and Tide Bell by Marcus Vergette
22. Nelson's Ship in a Bottle by Yinka Shonibare
23. House by Rachel Whiteread
24. Horizon Field by Antony Gormley

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
