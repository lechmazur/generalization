Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Rivers that have been heavily modified for agricultural irrigation purposes in semi-arid regions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Colorado River
2. Murray River
3. Indus River
4. Yellow River

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Amazon River
6. Mississippi River
7. Yangtze River
8. Thames River
9. Seine River
10. Ganges River
11. Danube River
12. Nile River
13. Volga River
14. Loire River
15. Hudson River
16. Rhine River
17. Po River
18. Tagus River
19. Elbe River
20. Amazon Basin
21. Great Lakes
22. Lake Victoria
23. Lake Baikal
24. Lake Superior

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
