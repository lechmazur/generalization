Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Underground cooking methods that use heated stones or rocks as the primary heat source

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a traditional Hawaiian imu pit
2. a Māori hāngī earth oven
3. a Native American clambake using heated stones
4. a Scandinavian ground oven for cooking lamb

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a gas stove
6. a charcoal grill
7. a solar oven
8. a microwave
9. a tandoor oven
10. a wood-fired pizza oven
11. a campfire
12. a sous-vide machine
13. a pressure cooker
14. a Dutch oven
15. a rice cooker
16. a toaster oven
17. a hot plate
18. a smoker
19. a rotisserie
20. a slow cooker
21. a hibachi grill
22. a convection oven
23. a steam cooker
24. a fondue pot

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
