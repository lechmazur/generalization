Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient mythological figures who gained immortality or divine status through studying or mastering a specific academic discipline

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, who mastered writing and mathematics to achieve divine status
2. Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, who gained immortality through her mastery of strategy and warfare
3. Confucius, who was deified in Chinese tradition for his profound understanding of ethics and philosophy
4. Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure who attained divine knowledge through the study of alchemy and hermeticism

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hercules, who achieved immortality through completing the Twelve Labors
6. Odysseus, who gained fame through his cunning and adventures in the Odyssey
7. Prometheus, who was punished for stealing fire from the gods
8. Perseus, who became a hero by slaying Medusa
9. Orpheus, who attempted to retrieve his wife from the underworld
10. Jason, who sought the Golden Fleece
11. Theseus, who defeated the Minotaur
12. Achilles, who gained immortality through his mother's intervention
13. Dionysus, who became a god of wine and revelry
14. Apollo, who was born a god and associated with music and prophecy
15. Artemis, who was born a goddess and associated with hunting
16. Hades, who ruled the underworld as a god
17. Poseidon, who ruled the seas as a god
18. Zeus, who became the king of the gods through overthrowing the Titans
19. Medea, who used magic to achieve her goals
20. Circe, who transformed men into animals with her sorcery
21. Icarus, who flew too close to the sun
22. Narcissus, who became a flower after his obsession with his reflection
23. Eros, who was born a god of love
24. Hephaestus, who was born a god of craftsmanship

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
