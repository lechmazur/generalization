Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that facilitate communication while adhering to cultural norms of indirectness or politeness.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Emoticons in messaging apps
2. Indirect language translation features
3. Anonymous feedback tools
4. Read receipts in emails

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Video conferencing software
6. Instant messaging apps
7. Social media platforms
8. Voice recognition technology
9. Augmented reality glasses
10. Virtual reality headsets
11. Online forums
12. Text-to-speech software
13. Speech-to-text software
14. Cloud storage services
15. File sharing applications
16. Search engines
17. Online translation services
18. Digital calendars
19. Project management tools
20. Online payment systems
21. Smart home devices
22. Wearable fitness trackers
23. Online gaming platforms
24. Podcast streaming services

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
