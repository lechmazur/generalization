Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural artifacts or practices that have been repurposed or transformed from their original ceremonial or sacred context into modern, secular, or artistic expressions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. tattoos inspired by Polynesian tribal designs
2. Japanese tea ceremonies adapted for modern wellness retreats
3. Native American dreamcatchers sold as home decor
4. African masks displayed in contemporary art galleries

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wedding ring
6. a Christmas tree
7. a menorah
8. a rosary
9. a totem pole
10. a Viking helmet
11. a yin-yang symbol
12. a Buddha statue
13. a Celtic cross
14. a Native American headdress
15. a Greek amphora
16. a Chinese lantern
17. a Hindu mandala
18. a Japanese kimono
19. a Viking longship
20. a Mayan calendar
21. a Roman toga
22. a medieval tapestry
23. a Tibetan prayer flag
24. a Zulu shield

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
