Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made from natural materials that are commonly used for drinking vessels

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a coconut shell cup
2. a bamboo tumbler
3. a gourd canteen
4. a wooden tankard

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a ceramic mug
6. a glass tumbler
7. a plastic water bottle
8. a metal flask
9. a paper cup
10. a porcelain teacup
11. a stainless steel thermos
12. a crystal goblet
13. a silicone straw
14. a copper mug
15. a clay pot
16. a enamel cup
17. a fiberglass bottle
18. a rubber water bladder
19. a vinyl pitcher
20. a stone mortar
21. a leather pouch
22. a woven basket
23. a seashell necklace
24. a feather quill

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
