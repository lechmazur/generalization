Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Textile art forms that incorporate traditional cultural symbolism and are used in ceremonial or significant life events.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. An intricately embroidered Hmong story cloth depicting the group's migration journey, used in wedding ceremonies.
2. A Navajo wedding basket woven with specific geometric patterns symbolizing prosperity and harmony, presented to the bride.
3. A Kente cloth woven with Adinkra symbols representing concepts like wisdom and leadership, worn during chieftaincy installations in Ghana.
4. A Bolivian Aguayo textile featuring vibrant colors and stylized depictions of animals and deities, used in rituals honoring Pachamama (Mother Earth).

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A tie-dye t-shirt.
6. A crocheted blanket.
7. A macrame wall hanging.
8. An embroidered pillowcase.
9. A hand-knitted sweater.
10. A quilt with a geometric pattern.
11. A tapestry depicting a landscape.
12. A batik scarf with floral motifs.
13. A beaded necklace.
14. A woven rug with abstract designs.
15. A piece of lace used for trimming a dress.
16. A silk screen printed poster.
17. A digitally printed fabric with a repeating pattern.
18. Flags used in national celebrations.
19. Theater costumes for a historical play.
20. A hand-painted silk fan.
21. A leather belt with embossed designs.
22. A feathered headdress worn for decorative purposes.
23. A patchwork denim jacket.
24. Embroidered patches on a scout uniform.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
