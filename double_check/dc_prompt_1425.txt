Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or locations that were illuminated exclusively by whale oil lamps during their initial public unveiling

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The interior of the American Museum of Natural History's original building
2. Displays at the first World's Fair in London (1851), in areas not using gas lighting
3. Early photographic studios in the mid-19th century, before electric lighting
4. Some of the paintings in the Louvre during its initial opening as a museum in 1793

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A lighthouse in the 18th century
6. A whaling ship
7. A street lamp in 19th century London
8. A painting of a whale
9. A Victorian era home
10. A kerosene lamp
11. A theater stage in the 1800s
12. A beeswax candle
13. A gaslight
14. A tavern in colonial America
15. An oil painting
16. A scrimshaw carving
17. A fireplace
18. The Eiffel Tower
19. The Statue of Liberty
20. A daguerreotype
21. A phonograph
22. A typewriter
23. A horse-drawn carriage
24. A sailing ship

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
