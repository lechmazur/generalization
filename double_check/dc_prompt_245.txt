Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for surveillance that are disguised as everyday items

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a clock with a hidden camera
2. a pen equipped with a recording device
3. a pair of glasses with built-in video recording
4. a USB charger containing a covert listening device

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a security camera mounted on a wall
6. a drone used for aerial photography
7. a smartphone with a front-facing camera
8. a laptop with a built-in webcam
9. a baby monitor with video capabilities
10. a doorbell with a visible camera
11. a dashcam installed in a car
12. a body-worn police camera
13. a CCTV system in a store
14. a wildlife trail camera
15. a GoPro mounted on a helmet
16. a handheld camcorder
17. a telescope with a camera attachment
18. a security mirror in a retail store
19. a fingerprint scanner at an airport
20. a metal detector at a concert
21. a motion sensor light
22. a GPS tracking device for vehicles
23. a smart thermostat with occupancy detection
24. a fitness tracker with heart rate monitoring

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
