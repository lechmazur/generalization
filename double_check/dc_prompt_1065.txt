Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Illustrated works by artists who also designed public spaces or architectural elements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Tale of Peter Rabbit illustrations by Beatrix Potter
2. Where the Wild Things Are illustrations by Maurice Sendak
3. The Little Prince illustrations by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
4. Alice in Wonderland illustrations by John Tenniel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle
6. Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson
7. The Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo
8. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci
9. The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh
10. Guernica by Pablo Picasso
11. The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí
12. The Scream by Edvard Munch
13. American Gothic by Grant Wood
14. The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli
15. The Night Watch by Rembrandt
16. Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer
17. The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch
18. Impression, Sunrise by Claude Monet
19. The Son of Man by René Magritte
20. Campbell's Soup Cans by Andy Warhol
21. The Kiss by Gustav Klimt
22. Dogs Playing Poker by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge
23. Christina's World by Andrew Wyeth
24. The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Hokusai

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
