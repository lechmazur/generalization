Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to extend human vision beyond the normal range of sight, using optical elements and requiring direct eye contact.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A device used by astronomers to observe distant celestial bodies.
2. An instrument that allows for the magnification of small objects for detailed study.
3. A tool used by birdwatchers to bring distant birds into closer view.
4. An apparatus used in theaters to enhance the audience's view of the stage.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A camera used to capture images from a distance.
6. A digital screen that displays enlarged images.
7. A satellite that monitors weather patterns from space.
8. A pair of glasses that correct vision impairments.
9. A microscope slide used to hold specimens for examination.
10. A telescope mount that stabilizes viewing equipment.
11. A lens used in photography to focus light.
12. A night vision device that enhances visibility in low light.
13. A magnifying glass used to start fires with sunlight.
14. A periscope used to see over obstacles.
15. A rearview mirror used in vehicles to see behind.
16. A contact lens that corrects astigmatism.
17. A laser pointer used to highlight distant objects.
18. A drone equipped with a camera for aerial photography.
19. A pair of binoculars used for marine navigation.
20. A monocular used for hunting to spot game.
21. A spyglass used historically for maritime exploration.
22. A camera lens filter that enhances color in photographs.
23. A heads-up display in aircraft for pilot assistance.
24. A thermal imaging camera used for detecting heat signatures.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
