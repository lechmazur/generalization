Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or behaviors that involve temporary structures formed for the purpose of attraction or display

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The elaborate courtship dance of the bowerbird, where males construct and decorate a bower to attract females.
2. The vibrant, temporary display of colors produced by the Aurora Borealis to attract viewers.
3. The intricate sand structures created by male fiddler crabs to attract mates during mating season.
4. The ephemeral, glowing patterns formed by fireflies during their mating displays.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The permanent nest of a bird used for raising offspring.
6. The migratory patterns of monarch butterflies.
7. The structural integrity of a beaver dam.
8. The daily opening and closing of a flower.
9. The territorial markings of a lion.
10. The hibernation behavior of bears.
11. The permanent web of a spider used for catching prey.
12. The annual migration of wildebeest.
13. The chemical signals used by ants to communicate.
14. The permanent burrow of a rabbit.
15. The seasonal camouflage of the arctic fox.
16. The vocalization patterns of whales.
17. The permanent hive structure of bees.
18. The feeding behavior of hummingbirds.
19. The social hierarchy within a wolf pack.
20. The permanent den of a fox.
21. The echolocation used by bats.
22. The molting process of a snake.
23. The permanent coral reef structures.
24. The photosynthesis process in plants.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
