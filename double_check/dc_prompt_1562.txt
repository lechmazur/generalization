Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Controversial ballet dancers who have appeared in luxury fashion brand campaigns

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sergei Polunin
2. Misty Copeland
3. Roberto Bolle
4. Maria Kochetkova

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mikhail Baryshnikov
6. Anna Pavlova
7. Margot Fonteyn
8. Rudolf Nureyev
9. Natalia Vodianova
10. Kate Moss
11. Cara Delevingne
12. Naomi Campbell
13. Sylvie Guillem
14. Carlos Acosta
15. Diana Vishneva
16. Alessandra Ferri
17. Gelsey Kirkland
18. Maya Plisetskaya
19. Darcey Bussell
20. Tamara Rojo
21. Edward Watson
22. Svetlana Zakharova
23. David Hallberg
24. Alina Cojocaru

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
