Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ritualistic objects or practices that incorporate symbolic packaging or containment as a central element of their function or meaning.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Placing a lock of hair from a newborn baby inside a locket and wearing it for protection.
2. Burying a time capsule filled with personal items and messages to be opened at a future date.
3. Sealing written prayers or wishes inside a prayer wheel and spinning it to release the intentions.
4. Placing the ashes of a deceased person in an urn and keeping it in a place of honor.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lighting a candle for a loved one.
6. Clapping hands during a performance.
7. Bowing before a religious figure.
8. Wearing a wedding ring.
9. Singing hymns in a church.
10. Giving alms to the poor.
11. Making the sign of the cross.
12. Fasting during Ramadan.
13. Circumambulating a sacred site.
14. Offering food to deities.
15. Dancing in a ceremonial circle.
16. Chanting mantras during meditation.
17. Burning incense during a ritual.
18. Creating a sand mandala.
19. Carrying a lucky charm.
20. Knocking on wood for good luck.
21. Throwing coins into a fountain.
22. Hanging dream catchers.
23. Wearing religious jewelry.
24. Displaying family photographs.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
