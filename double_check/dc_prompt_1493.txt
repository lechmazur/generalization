Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Brazilian martial arts and combat dance forms that originated among enslaved people in the Americas during the colonial period

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Capoeira
2. Maculelê
3. Samba de Roda
4. Batuque

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Kung Fu
6. Taekwondo
7. Judo
8. Ballet
9. Hip Hop
10. Flamenco
11. Tango
12. Salsa
13. Breakdancing
14. Modern Dance
15. Jazz Dance
16. Contemporary Dance
17. Folk Dance
18. Traditional African Dance
19. Indian Classical Dance
20. Sumo Wrestling
21. Boxing
22. Muay Thai
23. Karate
24. Wrestling

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
