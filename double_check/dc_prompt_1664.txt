Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that were once used as projectile weapons in ancient warfare but are now primarily displayed in museums or used for ceremonial purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Atlatl
2. Ballista
3. Onager
4. Trebuchet

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Spear
6. Shield
7. Sword
8. Helmet
9. Chariot
10. Catapult
11. Crossbow
12. Longbow
13. Slingshot
14. Javelin
15. Boomerang
16. Dart
17. Arrow
18. Blowgun
19. Harpoon
20. Trident
21. Mace
22. Axe
23. Flail
24. Pike

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
