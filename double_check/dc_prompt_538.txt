Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Entities or systems experiencing a rapid, transformative change in state driven by an imbalance or inequity reaching a critical threshold.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a forest fire igniting after a prolonged drought
2. a stock market crash following a speculative bubble
3. a volcanic eruption triggered by pressure build-up
4. a social revolution sparked by widespread inequality

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a gentle snowfall
6. a plant growing in a garden
7. a river flowing steadily
8. a car accelerating smoothly on a highway
9. a sunrise over the ocean
10. a book being read from start to finish
11. a marathon runner pacing themselves
12. a tree shedding leaves in autumn
13. a glacier melting slowly over centuries
14. a clock ticking
15. a bird migrating south for the winter
16. a computer processing data
17. a child learning to walk
18. a river delta forming over millennia
19. a city expanding gradually
20. a person aging over time
21. a flower blooming in spring
22. a train arriving at a station
23. a candle burning steadily
24. a bridge being constructed

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
