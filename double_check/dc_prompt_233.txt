Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for public interaction that incorporate non-Euclidean shapes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A playground sculpture with twisting, interlocking surfaces that children can climb on
2. An interactive art installation in a museum where visitors navigate through a maze of curved, non-linear walls
3. A public bench designed with a MÃ¶bius strip shape, allowing people to sit and interact with its continuous loop
4. A community gathering space featuring a central fountain with spiraling, non-Euclidean water features that people can touch and play with

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional park bench
6. A standard playground slide
7. A city fountain with straight, geometric shapes
8. A public art installation with Euclidean shapes
9. A museum exhibit featuring flat, two-dimensional art
10. A community center with rectangular tables and chairs
11. A bus stop shelter with a simple, box-like design
12. A public library with straight, linear bookshelves
13. A city park with traditional, Euclidean-shaped playground equipment
14. A shopping mall with standard, rectangular seating areas
15. A public restroom with conventional, straight-lined stalls
16. A town square with a traditional, Euclidean-shaped gazebo
17. A public swimming pool with straight, rectangular lanes
18. A city street with standard, Euclidean-shaped crosswalks
19. A public garden with traditional, straight-lined pathways
20. A community center with a standard, rectangular dance floor
21. A public transportation hub with conventional, Euclidean-shaped seating
22. A city park with a traditional, straight-lined jogging path
23. A public plaza with standard, Euclidean-shaped planters
24. A community gathering space with conventional, rectangular picnic tables

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
