Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine a primary functional structure with a secondary stabilizing or balancing element, often asymmetrical in design or purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a cantilever chair
2. a bicycle with a kickstand
3. a leaning tower with a counterweight
4. a teapot with a stabilizing handle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a ladder
6. a seesaw
7. a pendulum clock
8. a rocking chair
9. a balance scale
10. a tripod
11. a unicycle
12. a gyroscope
13. a trampoline
14. a hammock
15. a suspension bridge
16. a windmill
17. a spinning top
18. a parachute
19. a kite
20. a sailboat
21. a catapult
22. a crane
23. a wheelbarrow
24. a swing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
