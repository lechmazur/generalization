Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures built in the 1930s that are considered engineering marvels and are still in use today.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco
2. The Hoover Dam on the Colorado River
3. The Empire State Building in New York City
4. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Eiffel Tower in Paris
6. The Panama Canal
7. The Brooklyn Bridge in New York City
8. The Taj Mahal in India
9. The Great Wall of China
10. The Colosseum in Rome
11. The Statue of Liberty in New York City
12. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai
13. The Channel Tunnel between England and France
14. The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur
15. The Millennium Bridge in London
16. The Akashi Kaikyo Bridge in Japan
17. The Three Gorges Dam in China
18. The Sears Tower (now Willis Tower) in Chicago
19. The Gateway Arch in St. Louis
20. The Space Needle in Seattle
21. The CN Tower in Toronto
22. The London Eye in London
23. The Palm Jumeirah in Dubai
24. The High Line in New York City

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
