Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for automated repetitive tasks that involve direct manipulation of physical objects and were commercially available before 1990.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a robotic arm used in automotive assembly lines
2. a vending machine dispensing snacks
3. a coin-operated laundry machine
4. a mechanical typewriter with automated carriage return

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a modern 3D printer
6. a self-driving car
7. a drone used for delivery
8. a smart thermostat
9. a CNC milling machine
10. a robotic vacuum cleaner
11. a digital camera
12. a microwave oven
13. a sewing machine
14. a cash register
15. a conveyor belt system
16. a hydraulic press
17. a wind-up toy
18. a mechanical calculator
19. a gramophone
20. a telegraph machine
21. a rotary phone
22. a slide projector
23. a record player
24. a manual hand drill

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
