Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures who significantly altered the course of a civilization through a single decisive event or conquest.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon in 49 BC, leading to the end of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.
2. William the Conqueror's victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, which led to the Norman Conquest of England.
3. Genghis Khan's unification of the Mongol tribes in 1206, setting the stage for the creation of the Mongol Empire.
4. Hernán Cortés's conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521, significantly altering the course of Mesoamerican history.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Leonardo da Vinci, known for his contributions to art and science during the Renaissance.
6. Mahatma Gandhi, who led India to independence through nonviolent resistance.
7. Albert Einstein, whose theory of relativity revolutionized physics.
8. Marie Curie, the first person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.
9. Napoleon Bonaparte, who rose to power during the French Revolution and led numerous military campaigns.
10. Martin Luther King Jr., a leader in the American civil rights movement.
11. Christopher Columbus, who initiated European exploration and colonization of the Americas.
12. Isaac Newton, whose laws of motion and universal gravitation laid the foundations of classical mechanics.
13. Queen Elizabeth I, who ruled England during a period of significant cultural and political change.
14. Karl Marx, whose ideas on communism influenced political movements worldwide.
15. Thomas Edison, known for his inventions that contributed to modern life.
16. Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution by natural selection transformed biology.
17. Socrates, a philosopher whose teachings influenced Western philosophy.
18. Confucius, whose teachings shaped Chinese culture and ethics.
19. Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
20. Nelson Mandela, who fought against apartheid and became South Africa's first black president.
21. Galileo Galilei, whose work in astronomy and physics challenged prevailing views of the universe.
22. Oprah Winfrey, a media mogul who has influenced popular culture and philanthropy.
23. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., who revolutionized personal computing and communication.
24. Frida Kahlo, an artist known for her surrealist works and personal style.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
