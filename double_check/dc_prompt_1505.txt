Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Transportation devices that combine Victorian-era mechanical systems with water-based propulsion

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. steam-powered paddle wheeler
2. hydraulic penny-farthing watercraft
3. water-turbine velocipede boat
4. steam-pump propelled water carriage

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. steam locomotive
6. horse-drawn canal boat
7. penny-farthing bicycle
8. steam automobile
9. water wheel
10. sailing ship
11. hydraulic elevator
12. steam-powered factory machine
13. mechanical water pump
14. horse-drawn carriage
15. steam engine
16. water mill
17. mechanical clock
18. velocipede
19. paddle steamer
20. cable car
21. mechanical loom
22. water turbine
23. steam-powered printing press
24. mechanical calculator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
