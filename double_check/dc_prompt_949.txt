Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Archaeological sites where significant hominin fossils were discovered alongside evidence of early tool use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania
2. Dmanisi, Georgia
3. Swartkrans, South Africa
4. Atapuerca, Spain

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lascaux Cave, France
6. Stonehenge, England
7. Pyramids of Giza, Egypt
8. Terracotta Army, China
9. Machu Picchu, Peru
10. Chichen Itza, Mexico
11. Angkor Wat, Cambodia
12. Acropolis, Greece
13. Petra, Jordan
14. Colosseum, Italy
15. Easter Island, Chile
16. Great Wall of China, China
17. Moai Statues, Easter Island
18. Taj Mahal, India
19. Parthenon, Greece
20. Hadrian's Wall, England
21. Stone Circles of Senegambia, Senegal
22. Nazca Lines, Peru
23. Borobudur, Indonesia
24. Valley of the Kings, Egypt

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
