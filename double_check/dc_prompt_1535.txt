Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geometric patterns found in both ancient cave art and modern blacklight-reactive body paint designs

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Concentric circles in ochre from Chauvet Cave matched by UV-reactive spiral mandalas
2. Diamond lattice patterns from Serra da Capivara replicated in fluorescent geometric tattoos
3. Zigzag lines from Lascaux Cave mirrored in neon body paint designs
4. Dot matrix patterns from Altamira Cave echoed in phosphorescent stippled body art

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Celtic knot designs
6. Henna wedding patterns
7. Aboriginal dot paintings
8. Islamic geometric tiles
9. Modern graffiti murals
10. Ancient Greek meanders
11. Polynesian tribal tattoos
12. Crop circles
13. Nazca lines
14. Rangoli floor designs
15. Native American petroglyphs
16. Egyptian hieroglyphic patterns
17. Maori facial tattoos
18. Chinese paper cutting designs
19. Mexican textile patterns
20. Roman mosaic floors
21. Sanskrit mandala designs
22. African tribal face paint
23. Persian carpet patterns
24. Japanese zen garden designs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
