Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or tools historically used by indigenous or traditional cultures for food preservation or storage, which are designed to protect contents from environmental elements or predators.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Underground storage pits lined with clay
2. Woven baskets sealed with natural resins
3. Dried and hollowed gourds
4. Smokehouses for curing meat

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Refrigerator
6. Freezer
7. Canning jars
8. Plastic wrap
9. Vacuum sealer
10. Tupperware
11. Clay pot (for cooking)
12. Metal can
13. Granary (modern)
14. Silo
15. Root cellar (modern)
16. Dehydrator
17. Spice rack
18. Food processor
19. Cooler
20. Lunchbox
21. Picnic basket
22. Ziploc bag
23. Aluminum foil
24. Parchment paper

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
