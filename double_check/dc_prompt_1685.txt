Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Prehistoric artifacts that were used to create or enhance sounds for ritual purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Divje Babe flute
2. Ras Shamra clay tablets with musical notation
3. Iberian Paleolithic bone whistles
4. Mezin mammoth bone trumpet

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cave paintings depicting animals
6. Stone hand axes
7. Neolithic pottery shards
8. Venus figurines
9. Burial goods like jewelry
10. Flint arrowheads
11. Bone needles
12. Ochre pigments
13. Charcoal drawings
14. Fossil remains of prehistoric animals
15. Ancient Roman coins
16. Medieval swords
17. Renaissance paintings
18. Modern musical instruments
19. Bird bone flutes from non-ritual contexts
20. Clay rattles used as children's toys
21. Stone tools for processing food
22. Wooden spears for hunting
23. Shell beads for personal adornment
24. Clay pots for storage

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
