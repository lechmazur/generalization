Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artworks depicting twins or duality created by artists of African descent.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kehinde Wiley's painting "Twins"
2. Twins Seven-Seven's sculpture "Duality"
3. Jean-Michel Basquiat's artwork "Two Sides"
4. Lorna Simpson's photograph "Duet"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of two birds by a European artist
6. A sculpture of a single figure by an African artist
7. A photograph of a mirrored room by an Asian artist
8. A drawing of two trees by a Latin American artist
9. A painting of a single person with two faces by a Middle Eastern artist
10. A sculpture of two intertwined snakes by an Indigenous artist
11. A photograph of two different people by an African artist
12. A painting of a person and their shadow by a European artist
13. A sculpture of two different animals by an Asian artist
14. A drawing of two separate mountains by a Latin American artist
15. A painting of two different flowers by a Middle Eastern artist
16. A sculpture of two different musical instruments by an Indigenous artist
17. A photograph of two different buildings by an African artist
18. A painting of two different cars by a European artist
19. A sculpture of two different fruits by an Asian artist
20. A drawing of two different books by a Latin American artist
21. A painting of two different shoes by a Middle Eastern artist
22. A sculpture of two different hats by an Indigenous artist
23. A photograph of two different bicycles by an African artist
24. A painting of two different clouds by a European artist

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
