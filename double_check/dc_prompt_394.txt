Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Art forms originating in specific geographic regions that incorporate stylized hand gestures as a primary means of expression.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kathakali
2. Noh
3. Bharatanatyam
4. Hula

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Flamenco
6. Jazz dance
7. Opera
8. Ballet
9. Tap dance
10. Hip hop dance
11. Breakdancing
12. Salsa
13. Tango
14. Modern dance
15. Ballroom dance
16. Mime
17. Street performance
18. Shadow puppetry
19. Musical theater
20. Folk dance
21. Contemporary dance
22. Capoeira
23. Step dance
24. Butoh

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
