Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cylindrical objects made of a single continuous, spirally wound strip of a homogeneous material, with no overlapping layers or seams.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a coiled telephone cord
2. a spiral notebook spring
3. a tightly wound slinky
4. a spiral staircase handrail

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a drinking straw
6. a paper towel roll
7. a garden hose
8. a metal pipe
9. a wooden dowel
10. a PVC tube
11. a rubber band
12. a coiled rope
13. a spring mattress
14. a spiral notebook
15. a corkscrew
16. a spiral pasta
17. a coiled snake
18. a spiral galaxy
19. a spiral staircase
20. a coiled wire
21. a spiral seashell
22. a spiral slide
23. a spiral notebook cover
24. a spiral-cut ham

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
