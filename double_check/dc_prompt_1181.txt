Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or processes that rely on sequential, interdependent stages to transform raw inputs into refined outputs, where each stage is essential for the final product's integrity or functionality.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a car assembly line
2. a software development lifecycle
3. a baking recipe for bread
4. a wastewater treatment plant

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bicycle
6. a computer
7. a tree
8. a river
9. a clock
10. a book
11. a bridge
12. a smartphone
13. a painting
14. a train
15. a camera
16. a musical instrument
17. a solar panel
18. a refrigerator
19. a DNA molecule
20. a road network
21. a light bulb
22. a pencil
23. a cloud
24. a chair

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
