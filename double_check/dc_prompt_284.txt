Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures built on naturally occurring, isolated, steep-sided, flat-topped hills or mountains primarily composed of basalt.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sigiriya in Sri Lanka
2. Masada in Israel
3. Monastery of St. Simeon in Syria
4. Jezreel Fortress in Israel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Wall of China
6. Eiffel Tower in Paris
7. Pyramids of Giza in Egypt
8. Statue of Liberty in New York
9. Machu Picchu in Peru
10. Colosseum in Rome
11. Acropolis in Athens
12. Stonehenge in England
13. Chichen Itza in Mexico
14. Petra in Jordan
15. Angkor Wat in Cambodia
16. Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy
17. Empire State Building in New York
18. Sydney Opera House in Australia
19. Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco
20. Burj Khalifa in Dubai
21. Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro
22. Taj Mahal in India
23. Parthenon in Athens
24. Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
