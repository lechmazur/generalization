Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures designed for temporary or seasonal use that have been repurposed or abandoned, retaining traces of their original function while adapting to a new context or decay.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A summer camp dining hall with peeling paint now used as winter storage for boats
2. An old carnival ticket booth converted into a garden shed
3. A weathered lifeguard tower serving as a coastal bird nesting site
4. A former ice fishing shack repurposed as a tool shed

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. An abandoned factory building
6. A demolished playground
7. A modern pop-up retail store
8. A portable classroom
9. A construction site office trailer
10. A mobile home
11. A circus tent
12. A festival stage
13. A greenhouse
14. A beach umbrella
15. A camping tent
16. A seasonal market stall
17. A shipping container home
18. A food truck
19. An outdoor movie screen
20. A wedding pavilion
21. A ski lift station
22. A poolside cabana
23. A parade float
24. A temporary art installation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
