Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural formations that are named after human-made structures or tools

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Devil's Bridge
2. Chimney Rock
3. Needle Rock
4. Cathedral Rock

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Giant's Causeway
6. Old Man of the Mountain
7. Devil's Tower
8. The Three Sisters
9. Half Dome
10. Stone Mountain
11. Rainbow Bridge
12. The Wave
13. Delicate Arch
14. Natural Bridge
15. Balanced Rock
16. Elephant Rock
17. Skull Rock
18. Shiprock
19. Devil's Marbles
20. The Mittens
21. Mushroom Rock
22. Camel Rock
23. Eagle Rock
24. Rabbit Rock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
