Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Significant historical events that occurred on December 17th and led to the creation of new fields or industries

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Wright brothers' first powered flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903
2. First successful test of plutonium fission at Los Alamos in 1944
3. Launch of ATLAS-1 computer at IBM in 1962
4. First Bitcoin transaction in 2009

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Signing of the Bill of Rights in 1791
6. Louisiana Purchase agreement in 1803
7. Battle of Waterloo in 1815
8. Opening of the Suez Canal in 1869
9. First light bulb demonstration in 1879
10. Completion of the Eiffel Tower in 1889
11. First radio transmission across Atlantic in 1901
12. Model T Ford introduction in 1908
13. Opening of Panama Canal in 1914
14. Russian Revolution in 1917
15. Discovery of penicillin in 1928
16. Pearl Harbor attack in 1941
17. First television broadcast in 1936
18. First nuclear test in 1945
19. Launch of Sputnik in 1957
20. Moon landing in 1969
21. First email sent in 1971
22. Fall of Berlin Wall in 1989
23. Launch of World Wide Web in 1990
24. Human Genome Project completion in 2003

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
