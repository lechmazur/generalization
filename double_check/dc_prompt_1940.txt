Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects created by humans that incorporate the Fibonacci sequence in their design or structure

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The spiral staircase in the Vatican Museum
2. The design of the Guggenheim Museum in New York
3. The arrangement of seeds in a sunflower
4. The pattern on a pinecone

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A golden ratio in art
6. A logarithmic spiral in nature
7. A fractal pattern in mathematics
8. A nautilus shell
9. A hurricane's structure
10. A galaxy's spiral arms
11. A snail's shell
12. A mathematical sequence in computer algorithms
13. A stock market trend analysis
14. A population growth model
15. A musical composition based on mathematical patterns
16. A geometric pattern in Islamic art
17. A branching pattern in trees
18. A river's meandering path
19. A DNA molecule's structure
20. A honeycomb's hexagonal pattern
21. A spider web's radial design
22. A leaf's venation pattern
23. A coral reef's growth pattern
24. A sand dune's formation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
