Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for rhythmic manipulation around a specific body part, requiring coordinated movement and often used for performance or exercise.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. poi
2. devil sticks
3. hula hoop
4. Chinese yo-yo

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. juggling balls
6. ribbon stick
7. baseball bat
8. tennis racket
9. golf club
10. skipping rope
11. kendama
12. frisbee
13. boomerang
14. football
15. basketball
16. baseball
17. hockey puck
18. boxing gloves
19. weightlifting belt
20. yoga mat
21. balance board
22. resistance band
23. rowing machine
24. treadmill

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
