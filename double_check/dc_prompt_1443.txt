Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Sacred or spiritual practices that historically took place in coniferous forests and involved rhythmic percussion

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A drumming circle held by indigenous tribes in the taiga for spiritual healing
2. A shamanic ritual involving rhythmic drumming in the boreal forests of Siberia
3. A sacred ceremony with percussion instruments in the pine forests of Scandinavia
4. A spiritual gathering with rhythmic percussion in the coniferous woods of the Pacific Northwest

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A meditation session in a deciduous forest
6. A rain dance in a desert region
7. A yoga retreat in a tropical rainforest
8. A firewalking ceremony on a beach
9. A chanting ritual in a bamboo grove
10. A spiritual dance in a savanna
11. A drumming session in an urban park
12. A sacred chant in a mountain cave
13. A percussion performance in a deciduous woodland
14. A spiritual gathering in a meadow
15. A rhythmic dance in a prairie
16. A ritual with bells in a temple
17. A spiritual retreat in a coastal forest
18. A drumming circle in a desert oasis
19. A sacred ceremony in a mangrove forest
20. A percussion event in a tundra
21. A spiritual practice in a swamp
22. A rhythmic ritual in a grassland
23. A sacred dance in a canyon
24. A drumming session in a tropical island

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
