Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Black and white photographs of endangered or threatened animal species found in the Everglades National Park.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Black and white photograph of a Florida panther
2. Black and white photograph of an American crocodile
3. Black and white photograph of a West Indian manatee
4. Black and white photograph of a wood stork

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Color photograph of a Florida panther
6. Black and white photograph of a great blue heron
7. Black and white photograph of an African elephant
8. Color photograph of Everglades scenery
9. Black and white photograph of a Bengal tiger
10. Black and white photograph of alligators
11. Painting of a Florida panther
12. Black and white photograph of a giant panda
13. Color photograph of a wood stork
14. Black and white photograph of Everglades vegetation
15. Black and white photograph of a common raccoon
16. Color photograph of an American crocodile
17. Black and white photograph of a mountain gorilla
18. Black and white photograph of a white-tailed deer
19. Color photograph of a manatee
20. Black and white photograph of a polar bear
21. Sketch of an endangered Florida panther
22. Black and white photograph of a blue jay
23. Digital illustration of Everglades wildlife
24. Black and white photograph of a sea turtle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
