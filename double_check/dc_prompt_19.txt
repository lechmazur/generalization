Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Isolated locations accessible only during low tide that have been used for religious ceremonies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The tidal island of Mont Saint-Michel in France, where a monastery has been built and used for religious ceremonies
2. The Holy Island of Lindisfarne in England, accessible during low tide and home to a historic priory
3. St Michael's Mount in Cornwall, England, where a castle and chapel are used for religious services during low tide access
4. The island of Tōshōdaiji in Japan, accessible only during low tide and used for Buddhist ceremonies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A church located on a hilltop, accessible by a road
6. A monastery situated in a remote mountain area, reachable by a hiking trail
7. A temple on an island that is always accessible by a bridge
8. A shrine located in a dense forest, accessible by a path
9. A cathedral in a city center, surrounded by urban development
10. A chapel on a cliff overlooking the sea, accessible by a staircase
11. A religious retreat center in a rural area, accessible by a dirt road
12. A sacred cave used for meditation, accessible by a narrow trail
13. A pagoda on a lake island, accessible by a boat
14. A mosque in a desert oasis, accessible by a paved road
15. A synagogue in a suburban neighborhood, accessible by public transportation
16. A church on a river island, accessible by a ferry
17. A temple on a mountain peak, accessible by a cable car
18. A monastery in a valley, accessible by a winding road
19. A shrine in a national park, accessible by a hiking trail
20. A chapel on a peninsula, accessible by a causeway
21. A religious site in a coastal town, accessible by a boardwalk
22. A sacred grove used for rituals, accessible by a forest path
23. A temple complex in a city, accessible by multiple roads
24. A church on an island in a lake, accessible by a bridge

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
