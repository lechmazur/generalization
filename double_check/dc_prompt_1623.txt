Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific or technological innovations that were initially met with strong skepticism from experts but later became widely accepted medical treatments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gastric ulcers being caused by bacteria (H. pylori)
2. In vitro fertilization (IVF)
3. The use of laparoscopic surgery
4. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The theory of evolution
6. The germ theory of disease (initially)
7. Continental drift
8. The heliocentric model of the solar system
9. The use of anesthesia
10. The discovery of penicillin
11. The development of vaccines
12. Organ transplantation
13. Gene therapy
14. Stem cell therapy
15. 3D printing in medicine
16. Artificial intelligence in healthcare
17. The use of blood transfusions
18. The development of X-rays
19. The use of chemotherapy
20. The development of antibiotics
21. The use of radiation therapy
22. The discovery of DNA
23. The Human Genome Project
24. CRISPR gene editing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
