Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological systems or devices that rely on decentralized, distributed networks to function, but whose operation is often misunderstood or invisible to the majority of users.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. BitTorrent file sharing protocol
2. Tor browser network
3. Blockchain cryptocurrency networks
4. IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Facebook Messenger
6. Gmail
7. Netflix streaming service
8. Amazon Cloud Storage
9. Cellular phone networks
10. GPS navigation systems
11. Traditional banking networks
12. Cable television infrastructure
13. Municipal power grids
14. Traditional telephone landlines
15. Radio broadcasting systems
16. Library catalog networks
17. Credit card payment systems
18. Hospital medical record systems
19. Traffic light control systems
20. Weather monitoring networks
21. Public transit tracking systems
22. Building security networks
23. Emergency response systems
24. Airline reservation systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
