Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): musical instruments that produce sound through the interaction of two or more independent rhythmic patterns simultaneously

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. maracas
2. polyrhythmic drums
3. claves
4. agogo bells

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. piano
6. violin
7. flute
8. tambourine
9. triangle
10. xylophone
11. guitar
12. clarinet
13. cymbals
14. harmonica
15. accordion
16. trumpet
17. harp
18. tuba
19. saxophone
20. bassoon
21. oboe
22. cello
23. timpani
24. gong

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
