Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Internet memes that originated from a single photograph of an animal and went on to inspire multiple cryptocurrency projects

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a cat video that went viral
6. a famous dog from a movie
7. a bird that became a social media sensation
8. a meme based on a fictional character
9. a viral video of a dancing animal
10. a popular animated animal character
11. a meme featuring a famous person
12. a viral challenge involving animals
13. a meme based on a historical event
14. a famous animal from a TV show
15. a meme that started from a cartoon
16. a viral animal rescue story
17. a meme based on a popular song
18. a famous animal from a book
19. a meme featuring a fictional superhero
20. a viral animal adoption story
21. a meme based on a viral dance
22. a famous animal from a commercial
23. a meme featuring a famous athlete
24. a viral animal trick video

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
