Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Latin jazz musicians who have received posthumous lifetime achievement Grammy awards

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tito Puente
2. Celia Cruz
3. Dizzy Gillespie
4. Ray Barretto

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Eddie Palmieri
6. Chucho Valdés
7. Poncho Sanchez
8. Arturo Sandoval
9. Ella Fitzgerald
10. Frank Sinatra
11. Tony Bennett
12. Billie Holiday
13. Miles Davis
14. John Coltrane
15. Charlie Parker
16. Thelonious Monk
17. Machito
18. Mario Bauzá
19. Cachao
20. Bebo Valdés
21. Irakere
22. Buena Vista Social Club
23. Wayne Shorter
24. Herbie Hancock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
