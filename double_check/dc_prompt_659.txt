Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that fundamentally changed human communication methods and were developed before the 15th century.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The development of the alphabet
2. The invention of papyrus
3. The creation of cuneiform writing
4. The development of ink and writing implements

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the printing press
6. The development of the telegraph
7. The creation of the telephone
8. The invention of the radio
9. The development of television
10. The creation of the internet
11. The invention of the smartphone
12. The development of social media
13. The creation of email
14. The invention of the postal service
15. The development of carrier pigeons
16. The creation of smoke signals
17. The invention of drums for communication
18. The development of sign language
19. The creation of cave paintings
20. The invention of the compass
21. The development of eyeglasses
22. The creation of the telescope
23. The invention of the microscope
24. The development of photography

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
