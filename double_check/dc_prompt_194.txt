Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made from unconventional materials that serve traditional functions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A chair made from recycled plastic bottles
2. A lamp constructed from repurposed glassware
3. A table crafted from reclaimed driftwood
4. A handbag fashioned from old bicycle tires

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A sculpture made from scrap metal
6. A painting created with unconventional paintbrushes
7. A piece of jewelry made from recycled materials
8. A building constructed with sustainable materials
9. A car designed with aerodynamic shapes
10. A musical instrument made from traditional wood
11. A piece of furniture designed with modern aesthetics
12. A kitchen utensil made from stainless steel
13. A toy made from eco-friendly materials
14. A piece of clothing made from organic cotton
15. A tool designed for a specific industrial purpose
16. A piece of art that uses light as a medium
17. A product designed for space-saving in small homes
18. A gadget that uses solar power
19. A piece of furniture that transforms into multiple forms
20. A kitchen appliance with smart technology
21. A piece of sports equipment made from high-tech materials
22. A decorative item made from traditional ceramics
23. A piece of furniture designed for outdoor use
24. A tool made from durable metal alloys

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
