Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Botanical illustrations in scientific publications from the 18th century that depict plants native to the Americas and utilize stipple engraving.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Illustration of *Helianthus annuus* (sunflower) from a 1789 botanical publication, using stipple engraving to depict its texture and form.
2. Depiction of *Passiflora incarnata* (passionflower) in a 1795 scientific journal, showcasing its intricate floral structure through stipple engraving.
3. Rendering of *Nicotiana tabacum* (tobacco plant) in an 18th-century botanical text, employing stipple engraving to highlight its leaves and flowers.
4. Illustration of *Capsicum annuum* (chili pepper) from a 1778 publication, utilizing stipple engraving to emphasize its fruit and foliage.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A 19th-century lithograph of a European rose species.
6. A watercolor painting of a Japanese cherry blossom from the 18th century.
7. A woodcut illustration of a medicinal herb from a 17th-century herbal.
8. A modern digital rendering of a tropical orchid.
9. A 20th-century photograph of a cactus native to the Americas.
10. A 16th-century engraving of a European oak tree.
11. A 19th-century botanical drawing of an African baobab tree.
12. A 21st-century scientific illustration of a fern using digital techniques.
13. A 15th-century illuminated manuscript depicting a Middle Eastern palm tree.
14. A 20th-century linocut print of a sunflower.
15. A 19th-century etching of a European tulip.
16. A 17th-century copperplate engraving of a European lily.
17. A 20th-century botanical poster of a South African protea.
18. A 16th-century woodblock print of a Chinese bamboo plant.
19. A 21st-century acrylic painting of a North American pine tree.
20. A 19th-century lithograph of an Australian eucalyptus tree.
21. A 20th-century pencil sketch of a European daisy.
22. A 18th-century ink drawing of a Himalayan rhododendron.
23. A 17th-century botanical illustration of a Mediterranean olive tree.
24. A 21st-century 3D model of a tropical bromeliad.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
