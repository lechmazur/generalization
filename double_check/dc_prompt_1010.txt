Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that rely on perforations or punctures to function or achieve their intended purpose, where the holes are essential to their operation or design.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. cheese grater
2. flute
3. perforated metal sheet
4. tea strainer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. basketball hoop
6. fishing net
7. birdcage
8. chain-link fence
9. colander
10. window screen
11. tennis racket
12. honeycomb
13. golf ball
14. lattice
15. mesh bag
16. strainer
17. netting
18. bird's nest
19. chainmail
20. spaghetti spoon
21. fly swatter
22. screen door
23. wire rack
24. knitted sweater

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
