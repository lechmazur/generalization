Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographic features smaller than 100 square kilometers completely enclosed by the territorial waters of a single nation-state as defined by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hashima Island
2. Spratly Island
3. Navassa Island
4. Rottnest Island

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hawaii
6. Great Barrier Reef
7. Mediterranean Sea
8. Lake Victoria
9. Amazon River Delta
10. Greenland
11. Persian Gulf
12. Bay of Bengal
13. Gulf of Mexico
14. Black Sea
15. Madagascar
16. Galapagos Islands
17. Strait of Gibraltar
18. English Channel
19. Bering Strait
20. South China Sea
21. Caspian Sea
22. Great Lakes
23. Baffin Island
24. Coral Sea

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
