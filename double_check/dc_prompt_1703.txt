Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Japanese business practices from the 1960s-1990s that were widely adopted by Western companies but later abandoned

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Quality circles
2. Lifetime employment (modified forms)
3. Seniority-based promotion
4. Keiretsu-like supplier relationships (exclusive, long-term)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Just-in-time inventory management
6. Kaizen (continuous improvement)
7. Total Quality Management (TQM)
8. Lean manufacturing
9. Six Sigma
10. Business process re-engineering
11. Matrix management structures
12. Open-plan offices
13. Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)
14. Cross-functional teams
15. 360-degree feedback
16. Management by objectives (MBO)
17. The Balanced Scorecard
18. Activity-based costing (ABC)
19. Outsourcing
20. Offshoring
21. Agile software development
22. Horizontal integration
23. Vertical integration
24. Diversification

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
