Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Paintings that depict mythological scenes and were created by artists who were born in the 18th century and primarily worked in France.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Jean-Baptiste Regnault's "The Education of Achilles"
2. Anne-Louis Girodet's "The Sleep of Endymion"
3. François Boucher's "Jupiter and Callisto"
4. Jacques-Louis David's "The Loves of Paris and Helen"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Peter Paul Rubens' "The Judgment of Paris"
6. Sandro Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus"
7. Gustave Moreau's "Oedipus and the Sphinx"
8. Caravaggio's "Narcissus"
9. John William Waterhouse's "Hylas and the Nymphs"
10. Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam"
11. Henri Matisse's "Icarus"
12. Salvador Dalí's "The Metamorphosis of Narcissus"
13. Edgar Degas' "Young Spartans Exercising"
14. Édouard Manet's "Olympia"
15. William-Adolphe Bouguereau's "The Birth of Venus"
16. Raphael's "The Triumph of Galatea"
17. Giorgione's "The Tempest"
18. Claude Monet's "Impression, Sunrise"
19. Vincent van Gogh's "Starry Night"
20. Paul Cézanne's "The Bathers"
21. Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper"
22. Rembrandt's "The Night Watch"
23. Hieronymus Bosch's "The Garden of Earthly Delights"
24. Gustav Klimt's "The Kiss"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
