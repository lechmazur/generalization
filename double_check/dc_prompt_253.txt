Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographical phenomena named after alcoholic beverages

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Brandywine Falls
2. Champagne Pool
3. Vodka Ice Lake
4. Tequila Volcano

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Whiskey River
6. Wine Country
7. Beer Can Island
8. Rum Cay
9. Gin Creek
10. Sake Lake
11. Cider Hill
12. Mezcal Mountain
13. Port Wine Stain
14. Aleutian Islands
15. Bourbon Street
16. Scotch Corner
17. Sherry River
18. Vermouth Sea
19. Brandywine Creek
20. Champagne Region
21. Vodka River
22. Tequila Sunrise
23. Whiskey Creek
24. Wine Lake

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
