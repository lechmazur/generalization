Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations that were major glass-making centers during both ancient Roman times and the Industrial Revolution

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Rhineland
2. Northern Italy (specifically areas like Aquileia)
3. Southern England (specifically areas like the Weald)
4. Catalonia (specifically areas around Barcelona)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Murano
6. Bohemia
7. Meissen
8. Sevres
9. Jingdezhen
10. Toledo
11. Jamestown
12. Pittsburgh
13. Corning
14. Mexico City
15. Sidon
16. Alexandria
17. Damascus
18. Constantinople
19. Venice
20. The Levant
21. Gaul
22. Syria
23. Egypt
24. Mesopotamia

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
