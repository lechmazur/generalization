Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that incorporate a dome designed by a renowned architect who was primarily known for their work in a different artistic field.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana, designed by Giorgio de Chirico
2. Philharmonie de Paris, designed by Jean Nouvel
3. Heydar Aliyev Center, designed by Zaha Hadid
4. Tempio Malatestiano, designed by Leon Battista Alberti

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. St. Peter's Basilica, designed by Michelangelo
6. Florence Cathedral, designed by Filippo Brunelleschi
7. United States Capitol, designed by William Thornton
8. Taj Mahal, designed by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri
9. Hagia Sophia, designed by Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles
10. St. Paul's Cathedral, designed by Christopher Wren
11. Berlin Cathedral, designed by Julius Carl Raschdorff
12. Santa Maria del Fiore, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio
13. Les Invalides, designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart
14. Rockefeller Center, designed by Raymond Hood
15. Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry
16. Lotus Temple, designed by Fariborz Sahba
17. Reichstag Building, designed by Norman Foster
18. Royal Albert Hall, designed by Francis Fowke and Henry Young Darracott Scott
19. British Museum, designed by Robert Smirke
20. St. Basil's Cathedral, designed by Postnik Yakovlev
21. Duomo di Milano, designed by Simone da Orsenigo
22. Panthéon, designed by Jacques-Germain Soufflot
23. Capitol Records Building, designed by Welton Becket
24. Notre-Dame de Paris, designed by Maurice de Sully

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
