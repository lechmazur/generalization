Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Paintings from 1850-1950 that prominently feature a subject's distinctive facial hair as a focal point of the composition

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Vincent van Gogh's Self Portrait with Pipe (1889)
2. Paul Gauguin's Portrait of Stéphane Mallarmé (1891)
3. Claude Monet's Self Portrait with a Beret (1886)
4. Giuseppe Verdi Portrait by Giovanni Boldini (1886)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. American Gothic by Grant Wood (1930)
6. The Scream by Edvard Munch (1893)
7. Whistler's Mother by James McNeill Whistler (1871)
8. Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer (1665)
9. The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli (1485)
10. The Night Watch by Rembrandt (1642)
11. The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí (1931)
12. Water Lilies by Claude Monet (1919)
13. The Kiss by Gustav Klimt (1908)
14. Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer by Gustav Klimt (1907)
15. The Card Players by Paul Cézanne (1895)
16. The Son of Man by René Magritte (1964)
17. Portrait of Dora Maar by Pablo Picasso (1937)
18. Christina's World by Andrew Wyeth (1948)
19. The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck (1434)
20. The Blue Boy by Thomas Gainsborough (1770)
21. Portrait of Madame X by John Singer Sargent (1884)
22. The Sleeping Gypsy by Henri Rousseau (1897)
23. Lady with an Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci (1490)
24. A Bar at the Folies-Bergère by Édouard Manet (1882)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
