Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Organizations or initiatives that aim to foster global understanding and cooperation through multilingual communication and cultural exchange.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. UNESCO's International Mother Language Day
2. The Polyglot Conference
3. Global Voices Online
4. Erasmus+ Language Learning Programs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the United Nations General Assembly
6. the International Red Cross
7. the World Health Organization
8. the International Space Station
9. the Olympic Games
10. the World Economic Forum
11. the International Monetary Fund
12. the World Bank
13. the International Court of Justice
14. the International Atomic Energy Agency
15. the World Trade Organization
16. the International Labour Organization
17. the International Telecommunication Union
18. the International Maritime Organization
19. the International Civil Aviation Organization
20. the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
21. the International Organization for Migration
22. the International Criminal Court
23. the International Renewable Energy Agency
24. the International Fund for Agricultural Development

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
