Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that preserve or represent transient phenomena in a permanent or enduring form.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a photograph of a sunset
2. a fossilized footprint
3. a recording of a thunderstorm
4. a painting of a blooming flower

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a cloud
6. a rainbow
7. a gust of wind
8. a melting ice cube
9. a candle flame
10. a shooting star
11. a shadow
12. a soap bubble
13. a wave crashing on the shore
14. a snowflake
15. a sandcastle
16. a lightning bolt
17. a falling leaf
18. a puff of smoke
19. a ripple in water
20. a rainbow after rain
21. a gust of wind
22. a sparkler burning
23. a dewdrop on a leaf
24. a fireworks display

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
