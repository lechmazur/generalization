Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts first identified or theorized through telescopic observation and named after mythological figures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Uranus
2. Neptune
3. Jupiter's moon Io
4. Saturn's moon Titan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The planet Mars
6. The constellation Orion
7. The asteroid Ceres
8. The dwarf planet Pluto
9. The star Sirius
10. The galaxy Andromeda
11. The moon Europa
12. The comet Halley
13. The supernova SN 1987A
14. The nebula Crab
15. The planet Venus
16. The asteroid Vesta
17. The moon Callisto
18. The star Betelgeuse
19. The galaxy M87
20. The comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
21. The supernova SN 1054
22. The nebula Orion
23. The planet Mercury
24. The asteroid Pallas

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
