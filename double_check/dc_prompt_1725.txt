Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): International agreements focused on protecting specific environmental phenomena

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Convention on Biological Diversity
2. Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer
3. Ramsar Convention on Wetlands
4. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Paris Agreement on Climate Change
6. Kyoto Protocol
7. Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes
8. Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
9. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
10. International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture
11. Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade
12. Minamata Convention on Mercury
13. Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
14. International Whaling Commission
15. Antarctic Treaty System
16. International Maritime Organization's Marine Pollution Conventions
17. World Heritage Convention
18. Agenda 21
19. Global Environment Facility
20. International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
21. Green Climate Fund
22. United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
23. Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution
24. International Coral Reef Initiative

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
