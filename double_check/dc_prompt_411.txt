Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures built on the coast of a body of water that incorporate traditional navigational techniques or astronomical alignments specific to that region.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A stone circle on the Scottish coast aligned with the rising sun on the summer solstice, used by ancient mariners to calibrate their navigation tools.
2. A Polynesian temple complex on a Hawaiian island, featuring platforms and structures oriented towards specific stars used for open-ocean voyages.
3. A lighthouse on the coast of Portugal incorporating astrolabe-inspired architectural elements and aligned with key constellations used by Portuguese explorers.
4. An Inuit hunting lodge built on the Arctic coast, with windows and doorways positioned to track the movement of the sun and moon for predicting tides and ice conditions.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern beach house with large windows facing the ocean.
6. A seaside resort with a swimming pool and a pier.
7. An offshore oil rig.
8. A concrete seawall designed to protect against erosion.
9. A fishing pier with a tackle shop.
10. A floating dock for recreational boats.
11. A coastal fort built to defend against invaders.
12. A shipwreck lying on the seabed.
13. A tidal power plant generating electricity.
14. A research station studying marine life.
15. A seaside boardwalk with amusement park rides.
16. A container ship docked at a port.
17. A submarine base hidden in a coastal cove.
18. A bridge spanning a coastal inlet.
19. A seaside sculpture park.
20. A coastal highway following the shoreline.
21. A desalination plant providing fresh water.
22. A weather station monitoring coastal conditions.
23. A lifeguard tower on a beach.
24. A seaside amphitheater for concerts and performances.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
