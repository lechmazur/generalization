Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Inventions from the early 20th century that were initially met with skepticism but later became iconic in their respective fields.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Television
2. Helicopter
3. Ballpoint pen
4. Radar

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphone
6. Electric car
7. Internet
8. 3D printer
9. Virtual reality headset
10. Bluetooth technology
11. GPS navigation
12. Artificial intelligence
13. Drone
14. Streaming services
15. Wearable fitness tracker
16. Smart home devices
17. Electric scooter
18. Social media platforms
19. Cloud computing
20. Self-driving car
21. Biometric authentication
22. Quantum computing
23. Augmented reality
24. Blockchain technology

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
