Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic works or techniques that incorporate spectral or layered visual or auditory elements to create depth or complexity, often inspired by natural phenomena or cultural traditions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A watercolor painting using wet-on-wet technique to create ethereal color transitions
2. A musical composition utilizing overtone singing with multiple harmonics
3. A glass art piece with dichroic coating displaying shifting color spectrums
4. A digital animation incorporating multiple translucent layers with varying opacity

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A stained glass window
6. A rainbow prism
7. A kaleidoscope
8. A hologram
9. A color wheel
10. A crystal chandelier
11. An oil painting
12. A soap bubble
13. A laser light show
14. A tie-dye shirt
15. A mosaic mural
16. A double exposure photograph
17. An echo chamber
18. A mirror maze
19. A sunset photograph
20. A neon sign
21. A shadow puppet show
22. A wind chime
23. A light diffraction pattern
24. A colored smoke bomb

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
