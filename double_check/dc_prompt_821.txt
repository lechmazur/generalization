Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional practices or tools used for navigation or guidance that incorporate spiritual or ritualistic elements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A divining rod used in water dowsing ceremonies
2. A medicine wheel employed in Native American spiritual guidance
3. An astrolabe used in Islamic prayer direction finding
4. A feng shui compass used in Chinese geomancy for site selection

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A compass used for orienteering
6. A sextant used for celestial navigation
7. A GPS device for modern navigation
8. A map used for route planning
9. A smartphone app for navigation
10. A star chart used for astronomical observation
11. A radar system used in aviation
12. A nautical chart for maritime navigation
13. A theodolite used in surveying
14. A gyrocompass used on ships
15. A sundial for timekeeping
16. A pedometer for tracking steps
17. A barometer for weather prediction
18. A telescope for astronomical observation
19. A protractor for measuring angles
20. A level for ensuring horizontal alignment
21. A clinometer for measuring slopes
22. A rangefinder for distance measurement
23. A speedometer for measuring vehicle speed
24. A thermometer for temperature measurement

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
