Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional dishes that incorporate seasonal herbs and are prepared during specific transitional periods of the year.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Soba noodles served with fresh mugwort during the spring equinox
2. Rice cakes mixed with chrysanthemum leaves for the autumn festival
3. Dumplings filled with chives and served during the winter solstice
4. A soup featuring basil and eaten during the summer solstice

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Grilled vegetables seasoned with rosemary
6. A stew with thyme, enjoyed in winter
7. Salad with mint, popular in summer
8. Pasta with sage, a fall favorite
9. Roast with oregano, a dish for any season
10. Herb-infused tea, enjoyed year-round
11. Fish baked with dill, a summer dish
12. Chicken with tarragon, a spring meal
13. Potatoes with parsley, a common side dish
14. Beef stew with cilantro, a winter warmer
15. Marinated olives with basil, a Mediterranean appetizer
16. Herb-crusted lamb, a festive dish
17. Quiche with chives, a brunch staple
18. Soup with lemongrass, a Southeast Asian favorite
19. Pesto sauce with basil, used in various dishes
20. Herb-roasted turkey, a Thanksgiving classic
21. Salmon with dill sauce, a Scandinavian specialty
22. Herb garden salad, a fresh summer option
23. Spaghetti with garlic and parsley, an Italian classic
24. Herb-infused vinegar, used in dressings and marinades

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
