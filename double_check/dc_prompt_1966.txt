Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): industrial systems designed for the automated processing and recycling of natural stone materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A robotic system that sorts marble slabs based on veining and color, then cuts them into standardized tiles for reuse.
2. A closed-loop system for crushing granite construction debris, separating the aggregate by size, and mixing it with a binder to create new construction blocks.
3. An automated facility that pulverizes slate waste from roofing tile production and uses the powder as a filler in asphalt mixtures.
4. A computerized system that analyzes the chemical composition of travertine remnants, then directs them to different processing streams for creating terrazzo or calcium carbonate powder.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A conveyor belt system for transporting iron ore.
6. A robotic arm used in automotive assembly.
7. A software program for managing inventory in a warehouse.
8. A 3D printer for creating plastic prototypes.
9. A water purification system for a municipal water supply.
10. A wind turbine for generating electricity.
11. A solar panel array for powering a home.
12. A recycling plant for processing plastic bottles.
13. A paper shredder for destroying confidential documents.
14. A wood chipper for processing tree branches.
15. A glass crushing machine for recycling glass bottles.
16. A metal sorting facility for separating ferrous and non-ferrous metals.
17. A concrete mixer for preparing concrete for construction.
18. An asphalt paving machine for road construction.
19. A tunnel boring machine for excavating tunnels.
20. A crane for lifting heavy objects.
21. A bulldozer for earthmoving.
22. An excavator for digging foundations.
23. A backhoe loader for digging and loading materials.
24. A dump truck for hauling materials.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
