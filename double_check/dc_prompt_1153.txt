Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures or designs that incorporate natural water features as a central, functional, or symbolic element in their form or purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fallingwater House
2. Trevi Fountain
3. Villa d'Este
4. Bellagio Hotel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Taj Mahal
6. Golden Gate Bridge
7. Stonehenge
8. Empire State Building
9. Sydney Opera House
10. Pantheon
11. Burj Khalifa
12. Parthenon
13. Notre Dame Cathedral
14. Petronas Towers
15. Chrysler Building
16. Guggenheim Museum
17. Palace of Versailles
18. Colosseum
19. Forbidden City
20. Hagia Sophia
21. Angkor Wat
22. Leaning Tower of Pisa
23. St. Peter's Basilica
24. Brandenburg Gate

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
