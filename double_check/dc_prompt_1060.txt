Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that combine organic, flowing forms with mechanical or industrial functionality, often bridging natural aesthetics and human engineering.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a wind turbine with biomimetic blade designs inspired by whale fins
2. a chair shaped like a tree branch with integrated mechanical hinges for adjustability
3. a lamp with a base resembling a rock formation and a flexible, robotic arm for directional lighting
4. a water fountain with a spiral, organic design that uses industrial pumps to create flowing patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bicycle
6. a wooden sculpture
7. a steam engine
8. a glass vase
9. a concrete bridge
10. a metal wrench
11. a plastic bottle
12. a ceramic teapot
13. a rubber tire
14. a leather jacket
15. a wooden table
16. a steel beam
17. a glass skyscraper
18. a cotton shirt
19. a brick wall
20. a paper airplane
21. a metal spoon
22. a plastic toy
23. a wooden chair
24. a glass jar

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
