Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Metal objects designed for vehicle attachment and towing

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. tow hitch
2. trailer ball mount
3. tow bar
4. recovery hook

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. carabiner
6. seatbelt buckle
7. wheel rim
8. engine block
9. exhaust pipe
10. steering wheel
11. brake caliper
12. fuel tank
13. radiator
14. shock absorber
15. windshield wiper
16. license plate frame
17. door handle
18. hood latch
19. spare tire holder
20. roof rack
21. mud flap
22. headlight housing
23. gear shift knob
24. dashboard panel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
