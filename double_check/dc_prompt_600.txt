Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Luxury goods depicted in pre-1600 Persian miniature paintings

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A jeweled dagger with an ornate hilt
2. A silk robe with intricate embroidery
3. A golden goblet encrusted with gemstones
4. An elaborately decorated manuscript cover

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern wristwatch
6. A Renaissance painting
7. A medieval European tapestry
8. A contemporary sculpture
9. A digital artwork
10. A Victorian-era dress
11. A Baroque-style chandelier
12. A 19th-century porcelain vase
13. A modern luxury car
14. A 20th-century designer handbag
15. A Roman mosaic
16. A Gothic cathedral
17. A Ming dynasty vase
18. A modern art installation
19. A contemporary fashion accessory
20. A 17th-century Dutch painting
21. A modern-day yacht
22. A 21st-century skyscraper
23. A medieval knight's armor
24. A contemporary music album

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
