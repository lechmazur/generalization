Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Industrial control systems developed before 1990 that are still in use today

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) from the 1980s used in manufacturing plants
2. SCADA systems installed in the 1970s for water treatment facilities
3. Analog control panels from the 1960s in power generation stations
4. Early distributed control systems (DCS) from the 1980s in oil refineries

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Modern IoT-enabled smart home devices
6. Robotic assembly lines introduced in the 2000s
7. Digital twin technology for industrial simulations
8. AI-driven predictive maintenance systems
9. Cloud-based industrial automation platforms
10. 3D printing machines used in prototyping
11. Autonomous drones for warehouse inventory management
12. Blockchain-based supply chain tracking systems
13. Augmented reality tools for factory worker training
14. Cybersecurity software for industrial networks
15. Energy-efficient HVAC systems in modern buildings
16. Smart grid technology for electricity distribution
17. Wearable devices for monitoring worker safety
18. Advanced robotics used in automotive manufacturing
19. Machine learning algorithms for quality control
20. Real-time data analytics platforms for factories
21. Wireless sensor networks in agriculture
22. Virtual reality systems for industrial design
23. Edge computing devices for process optimization
24. 5G-enabled industrial communication systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
