Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative metalwork patterns from the 1890s-1910s that incorporated stylized insect motifs

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A brooch featuring an abstract dragonfly design with intricate filigree work
2. An art nouveau vase with a relief pattern of stylized beetles around its neck
3. A silver belt buckle adorned with a geometric moth pattern
4. A decorative screen with a repeating pattern of elongated, stylized grasshopper shapes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of a butterfly in a garden
6. A floral pattern on a Victorian-era dress
7. A modern sculpture of a bee
8. An Art Deco lamp with geometric designs
9. A medieval tapestry depicting hunting scenes
10. A stained glass window with abstract shapes
11. A 1920s flapper dress with fringe details
12. A wooden carving of a bird from the 18th century
13. A contemporary jewelry piece with a spider motif
14. A Renaissance painting of a mythological creature
15. A 1950s diner with chrome and neon accents
16. A Celtic knot pattern on a leather bracelet
17. A Japanese kimono with cherry blossom designs
18. A Baroque mirror with ornate gold leaf framing
19. A minimalist abstract painting from the 1960s
20. A Native American dreamcatcher with feathers
21. A Gothic cathedral's stained glass depicting saints
22. A 1970s psychedelic poster with swirling colors
23. An Egyptian hieroglyphic carving on a stone tablet
24. A Rococo chandelier with crystal droplets

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
