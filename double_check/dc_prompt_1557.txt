Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Phenomena or processes that create temporary, self-organizing patterns in seemingly chaotic systems before dissolving back into disorder

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Whirlpools forming in a stream
2. Sand ripples appearing on desert dunes
3. Cloud formations during a thunderstorm
4. Snowflake crystallization patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Tree rings
6. Coral reefs
7. Mountain ranges
8. Spider webs
9. Beehives
10. Crystal formations in caves
11. Sand dunes
12. River deltas
13. Fingerprints
14. DNA helixes
15. Plant root systems
16. Blood vessel networks
17. Ocean currents
18. Planetary orbits
19. Animal migration routes
20. Rock layers
21. Shell patterns
22. Leaf veins
23. Ant colonies
24. Bird murmurations

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
