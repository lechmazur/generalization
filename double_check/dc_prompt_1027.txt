Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artworks or creative works that incorporate the concept of time as a central element, either through their subject matter, creation process, or intended interpretation, and are influenced by philosophical or spiritual ideas about the universe.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a painting depicting the cyclical nature of seasons over centuries
2. a sculpture that slowly erodes over time, symbolizing impermanence
3. a musical composition that uses silence and repetition to evoke the passage of time
4. a film that explores the concept of eternity through non-linear storytelling

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a photograph of a sunset
6. a clock with Roman numerals
7. a novel about a single day in a character's life
8. a stopwatch used in sports
9. a calendar with historical events marked
10. a sand timer used in board games
11. a documentary about the history of clocks
12. a painting of a clock melting
13. a poem about the fleeting nature of youth
14. a sculpture of a sundial
15. a song about waiting for someone
16. a film about time travel
17. a photograph of an hourglass
18. a novel about aging
19. a painting of a clock tower
20. a musical piece with a ticking rhythm
21. a sculpture of a calendar page
22. a film about a countdown to an event
23. a photograph of a clock face
24. a poem about the seasons changing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
