Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Products or systems that integrate humor as a core component to enhance user engagement and functionality.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a smartphone app that uses witty error messages to make troubleshooting enjoyable
2. a voice assistant that responds to user queries with playful jokes and puns
3. a fitness tracker that rewards users with humorous animations for meeting goals
4. a board game where the rules and mechanics are designed to create comedic situations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a calculator with a minimalist design
6. a GPS navigation system with a monotone voice
7. a plain white coffee mug
8. a standard office chair
9. a textbook with no illustrations
10. a basic alarm clock with no snooze button
11. a pair of noise-canceling headphones
12. a traditional wristwatch with no additional features
13. a straightforward recipe app
14. a plain wooden desk
15. a standard stapler
16. a basic flashlight
17. a simple umbrella
18. a regular toothbrush
19. a standard bicycle
20. a plain notebook
21. a basic toaster
22. a traditional wall calendar
23. a standard pair of scissors
24. a simple keychain

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
