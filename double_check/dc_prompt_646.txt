Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural practices that involve fermentation as a key process

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Making kimchi in Korea
2. Brewing sake in Japan
3. Preparing injera in Ethiopia
4. Making kombucha in China

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smoking salmon in Alaska
6. Sun-drying tomatoes in Italy
7. Making chocolate in Mexico
8. Roasting coffee beans in Ethiopia
9. Pressing olive oil in Greece
10. Making maple syrup in Canada
11. Brewing tea in India
12. Drying herbs in Provence
13. Making cheese in Switzerland
14. Grinding corn in Mexico
15. Curing ham in Spain
16. Distilling whiskey in Scotland
17. Salting cod in Norway
18. Making pasta in Italy
19. Smoking meat in Texas
20. Drying fish in Japan
21. Making flatbread in India
22. Pressing wine in France
23. Curing olives in Greece
24. Smoking tea in China

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
