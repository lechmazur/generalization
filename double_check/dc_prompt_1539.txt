Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or practices that claim to balance opposing forces while lacking clear empirical measurements of those forces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Feng shui principles for interior design, claiming to harmonize "chi" without verifiable methods to detect or measure it.
2. Certain alternative medicine practices that purport to balance "humors" or "energies" within the body, lacking scientific instruments or methods to quantify these supposed forces.
3. Personality typing systems based on four temperaments or similar archetypes, presented as balanced opposing traits without objective metrics for these personality dimensions.
4. Some management theories advocating for balancing "innovation" and "stability" within organizations, without clear definitions or measurements of these concepts.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Checks and balances in government
6. Supply and demand in economics
7. A balanced diet
8. Work-life balance
9. Yin and yang philosophy
10. Homeostasis in biology
11. A scale weighing two objects
12. A tightrope walker
13. Negotiating a compromise
14. Balancing a budget
15. The pH scale
16. A seesaw
17. Calibrating a scientific instrument
18. Mixing chemicals in a lab
19. A gymnast performing a handstand
20. A thermostat regulating temperature
21. The justice system
22. Ecosystems in nature
23. Cognitive behavioral therapy
24. A balanced chemical equation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
