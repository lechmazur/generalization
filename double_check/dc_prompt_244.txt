Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural features designed to support or distribute weight using columns or pillars in non-residential structures built before the 20th century.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The flying buttresses of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris
2. The Doric columns of the Parthenon in Athens
3. The granite pillars of Karnak Temple in Egypt
4. The stone vaults of Canterbury Cathedral

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Modern steel support beams in the Empire State Building
6. A wooden pergola in a garden
7. Concrete pillars of a highway overpass
8. Support posts in a residential basement
9. The metal frame of a greenhouse
10. A decorative column in a modern mall
11. The support structure of a backyard deck
12. Reinforced concrete columns in a parking garage
13. Load-bearing walls in an apartment building
14. The steel framework of a skyscraper
15. A wooden trellis in a vineyard
16. Support beams in a modern warehouse
17. The metal poles of a carport
18. Structural supports in a modern bridge
19. The foundation pillars of a beach house
20. A contemporary church's support structure
21. The metal framework of a stadium roof
22. Support columns in a subway station
23. The concrete pillars of a water tower
24. Load-bearing posts in a modern barn

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
