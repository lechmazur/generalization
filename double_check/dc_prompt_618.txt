Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative art objects incorporating both opaque and translucent materials to depict scenes of ritual possession.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a ceramic vase with opaque clay and translucent glass inlays depicting a shamanic trance ceremony
2. a carved wooden mask with opaque paint and translucent resin layers showing a spirit possession ritual
3. a stained glass panel combining opaque and translucent sections to illustrate a ceremonial dance invoking ancestral spirits
4. a sculpted stone altar with opaque stone and translucent crystal elements portraying a divination ritual

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a painting of a landscape with no translucent elements
6. a solid bronze statue of a warrior
7. a glass paperweight with no depiction of ritual scenes
8. a wooden chair with no decorative elements
9. a ceramic bowl with no translucent materials
10. a tapestry depicting a historical battle
11. a metal sculpture of an abstract shape
12. a porcelain teapot with floral patterns
13. a leather-bound book with no decorative art
14. a mosaic floor with geometric designs
15. a clay pot with no depiction of rituals
16. a glass vase with no opaque elements
17. a wooden carving of an animal
18. a metal shield with engraved patterns
19. a stone sculpture of a deity with no translucent materials
20. a fabric banner with no ritual scenes
21. a crystal figurine with no opaque elements
22. a ceramic figurine of a dancer with no translucent materials
23. a glass sculpture of a tree
24. a wooden box with no decorative art

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
