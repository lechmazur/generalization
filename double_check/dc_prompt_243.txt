Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Enclosed spaces on vehicles designed specifically for navigation or map storage

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. glove compartment in a Cessna aircraft
2. chart table on a yacht
3. map pocket in a locomotive cab
4. navigation drawer in a submarine control room

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. trunk of a car
6. center console storage
7. door pocket
8. overhead compartment
9. bike basket
10. saddlebag on a motorcycle
11. cargo hold
12. dashboard cubby
13. train luggage rack
14. boat cabin storage
15. airplane cockpit
16. bus driver compartment
17. ship's bridge
18. truck bed toolbox
19. RV storage compartment
20. helicopter instrument panel
21. train conductor's cabin
22. car sunglasses holder
23. boat anchor locker
24. plane's black box compartment

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
