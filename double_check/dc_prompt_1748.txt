Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Monarchs who reigned during significant scientific discoveries related to physics

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. King George III during the discovery of Uranus by William Herschel
2. Queen Victoria during the formulation of Maxwell's equations
3. King Louis XIV during the development of Newton's laws of motion
4. Emperor Hirohito during the discovery of the positron by Carl D. Anderson

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. King Henry VIII during the Reformation
6. Queen Elizabeth I during the exploration of the New World
7. Emperor Napoleon during the Napoleonic Wars
8. King Louis XVI during the French Revolution
9. Queen Isabella I during the voyage of Columbus
10. Emperor Qin Shi Huang during the construction of the Great Wall
11. King Charles II during the Great Fire of London
12. Queen Anne during the Act of Union
13. Emperor Charlemagne during the Carolingian Renaissance
14. King Philip II during the Spanish Armada
15. Queen Victoria during the Industrial Revolution
16. Emperor Augustus during the Pax Romana
17. King James I during the publication of the King James Bible
18. Queen Elizabeth II during the moon landing
19. Emperor Constantine during the Edict of Milan
20. King Edward VII during the Entente Cordiale
21. Queen Mary I during the Marian Persecutions
22. Emperor Justinian during the codification of Roman law
23. King George V during World War I
24. Queen Catherine the Great during the partition of Poland

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
