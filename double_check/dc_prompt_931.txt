Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artisanal tools and products that rely on natural materials and traditional methods for their creation, often requiring specialized knowledge passed down through generations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. hand-woven bamboo fishing basket
2. clay water vessel fired in earthen kiln
3. indigo-dyed textile using fermented leaves
4. bark paper made from mulberry fibers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. plastic weaving loom
6. factory-made ceramic bowl
7. synthetic dye kit
8. electric pottery wheel
9. mass-produced wooden spoon
10. machine-woven wool blanket
11. synthetic leather bag
12. printed cotton fabric
13. aluminum cooking pot
14. steel knitting needles
15. glass drinking cup
16. commercial paint brush
17. manufactured soap
18. plastic basket
19. metal gardening tools
20. synthetic rope
21. printed paper
22. industrial leather shoes
23. machine-carved wooden bowl
24. commercial yarn

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
