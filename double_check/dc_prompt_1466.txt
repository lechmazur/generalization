Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Inland river deltas that form triangular wetland ecosystems larger than 5,000 square kilometers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Peace-Athabasca Delta
2. Inner Niger Delta
3. Okavango Delta
4. Ili River Delta

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Nile Delta
6. Mississippi River Delta
7. Mekong Delta
8. Yellow River Delta
9. Amazon River Delta
10. Ganges Delta
11. Everglades
12. Pantanal
13. Okavango Basin
14. Lake Chad
15. Tonl√© Sap
16. Sudanese Red Sea coastal wetlands
17. Zambezi River Delta
18. Shatt al-Arab delta
19. Fly River Delta
20. Irrawaddy Delta
21. Niger River
22. Mackenzie River
23. Lake Athabasca
24. Lake Ngami

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
