Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made primarily of birch wood that are specifically designed for use in traditional Finnish saunas.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A birch wood sauna ladle
2. A birch wood sauna bucket
3. A birch wood sauna bench
4. A birch wood sauna backrest

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A cedar wood sauna ladle
6. A birch wood dining table
7. A birch wood bookshelf
8. A birch wood cutting board
9. A birch wood chair
10. A birch wood picture frame
11. A birch wood jewelry box
12. A birch wood clock
13. A birch wood lamp
14. A birch wood canoe paddle
15. A birch wood walking stick
16. A birch wood guitar
17. A birch wood serving tray
18. A birch wood salad bowl
19. A birch wood coat rack
20. A birch wood picture frame
21. A birch wood toy
22. A birch wood sculpture
23. A birch wood wine rack
24. A birch wood pen

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
