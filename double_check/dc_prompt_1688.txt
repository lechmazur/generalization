Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific or academic methods that rely on measuring the gradual decay or degradation of physical materials to determine chronological sequences

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. radiocarbon dating of organic materials
2. thermoluminescence dating of ceramics
3. potassium-argon dating of volcanic rocks
4. uranium-thorium dating of coral reefs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. tree ring analysis
6. stratigraphic layering in archaeology
7. paleomagnetic dating of rocks
8. ice core sampling
9. fossil record analysis
10. dendrochronology
11. varve chronology
12. obsidian hydration dating
13. amino acid racemization
14. electron spin resonance dating
15. cosmogenic nuclide dating
16. lead isotope analysis
17. molecular clock techniques
18. seriation in archaeology
19. typological dating of artifacts
20. pollen analysis
21. stable isotope analysis
22. geochemical fingerprinting
23. archaeomagnetic dating
24. lichenometry

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
