Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical concepts or physical phenomena that exhibit symmetry breaking under specific conditions, leading to distinct, observable patterns or behaviors.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A ferromagnet cooling below the Curie temperature.
2. A buckling beam under compression.
3. The Higgs mechanism in particle physics.
4. The formation of convection cells in a heated fluid.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A snowflake
6. A mirror image
7. A kaleidoscope pattern
8. A butterfly's wings
9. The human face
10. A crystal lattice
11. A spiral galaxy
12. A flower's petals
13. A honeycomb
14. A spiderweb
15. A tree branching
16. A river delta
17. A soap bubble
18. A planet's rings
19. A magnetic field
20. An electric field
21. The Doppler effect
22. A rainbow
23. A sonic boom
24. A pendulum

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
