Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Navigational instruments used for measuring angles in celestial navigation before the 18th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Astrolabe
2. Cross-staff
3. Quadrant
4. Backstaff

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Compass
6. Sextant
7. Chronometer
8. Barometer
9. Octant
10. Gyroscope
11. Log line
12. Marine chronometer
13. Radar
14. GPS device
15. Thermometer
16. Binoculars
17. Sonar
18. Magnetic compass
19. Echo sounder
20. Star chart
21. Celestial globe
22. Alidade
23. Astrolabe quadrant
24. Armillary sphere

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
