Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient manuscripts that incorporate both pictographic and phonetic writing systems to convey historical narratives.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Dresden Codex, a Mayan manuscript that uses both glyphs and phonetic elements to record astronomical and historical events.
2. The Oracle Bone Script from ancient China, which combines pictographs with phonetic characters to document divinations and historical records.
3. The Egyptian Book of the Dead, utilizing hieroglyphs that include both pictographic and phonetic elements to narrate the journey of the soul after death.
4. The Voynich Manuscript, which some theories suggest uses a combination of pictographic and phonetic symbols to convey historical or alchemical narratives.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ancient Greek pottery with only pictorial scenes depicting myths.
6. The Dead Sea Scrolls, written in Hebrew and Aramaic scripts without pictographic elements.
7. The Rosetta Stone, featuring three scripts but not specifically used for historical narratives.
8. Medieval illuminated manuscripts with illustrations and Latin text.
9. The Epic of Gilgamesh, written in cuneiform script without pictographic elements.
10. The Codex Atlanticus by Leonardo da Vinci, containing sketches and notes in mirror writing.
11. The Beowulf manuscript, written in Old English without pictographic elements.
12. The Book of Kells, an illuminated manuscript with Latin text and decorative elements.
13. The Magna Carta, a legal document written in Latin without pictographic elements.
14. The Domesday Book, a survey of England written in Latin without pictographic elements.
15. The Lindisfarne Gospels, featuring Latin text with decorative elements but no pictographs.
16. The Codex Sinaiticus, a Greek manuscript of the Christian Bible without pictographic elements.
17. The Diamond Sutra, a Chinese Buddhist text printed in 868 CE without pictographic elements.
18. The Codex Borgia, an Aztec manuscript with pictorial elements but no phonetic writing.
19. The Vinland Map, a controversial document with Latin text and a map but no pictographs.
20. The Codex Leicester, a scientific manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci with sketches and notes.
21. The Codex Mendoza, an Aztec manuscript with pictorial elements but primarily used for administrative purposes.
22. The Nag Hammadi library, a collection of early Christian and Gnostic texts without pictographic elements.
23. The Codex Telleriano-Remensis, an Aztec manuscript with pictorial elements but no phonetic writing.
24. The Shahnameh, a Persian epic poem with illustrations but written in Arabic script without pictographs.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
