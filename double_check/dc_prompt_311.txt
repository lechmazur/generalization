Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures incorporating a central dome surrounded by exactly four smaller, equidistant domes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, Turkey
2. The Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi in Turkestan, Kazakhstan
3. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, UAE
4. The Sultan Ahmed Mosque (Blue Mosque) in Istanbul, Turkey

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey
6. The Taj Mahal in Agra, India
7. The United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.
8. The Pantheon in Rome, Italy
9. The Florence Cathedral in Florence, Italy
10. The St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, Russia
11. The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem
12. The Reichstag Building in Berlin, Germany
13. The Louvre Pyramid in Paris, France
14. The Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia
15. The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain
16. The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C.
17. The St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City
18. The Great Mosque of Cordoba in Cordoba, Spain
19. The Baha'i House of Worship in New Delhi, India
20. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem
21. The Temple of Heaven in Beijing, China
22. The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, Mexico
23. The Cathedral of Brasília in Brasília, Brazil
24. The Lotus Temple in New Delhi, India

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
