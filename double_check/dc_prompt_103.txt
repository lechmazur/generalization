Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artworks, architectural designs, or natural formations that incorporate deliberate asymmetry to create a sense of dynamic tension or balance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao
2. Mount Fuji
3. Yin and Yang symbol
4. Henri Matisse's "The Snail"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a perfectly symmetrical snowflake
6. a traditional Greek temple
7. a Renaissance portrait
8. a classic Roman arch
9. a symmetrical butterfly
10. a traditional Japanese garden
11. a Baroque church facade
12. a symmetrical mandala
13. a Gothic cathedral
14. a traditional quilt pattern
15. a neoclassical building
16. a perfectly round pond
17. a symmetrical vase
18. a balanced scale
19. a symmetrical face
20. a traditional chessboard
21. a symmetrical starfish
22. a perfectly round clock
23. a symmetrical snowman
24. a traditional yin-yang without variation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
