Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Heavy industrial transportation systems that operate primarily on fixed routes and are powered by diesel engines

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Class 66 freight locomotive
2. EMD SD40-2 locomotive
3. GE AC4400CW locomotive
4. EMD GP38-2 switcher engine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Boeing 747
6. Electric streetcar
7. Container ship
8. Maglev train
9. Tesla Semi truck
10. Mining dump truck
11. Subway train
12. Cable car
13. Diesel-powered bus
14. Harbor crane
15. Electric locomotive
16. Steam engine
17. Forklift
18. Cargo helicopter
19. Monorail
20. Oil tanker
21. Diesel generator
22. Tractor trailer
23. Diesel-powered yacht
24. Logging truck

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
