Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Platforms established before 1990 that facilitate international trade negotiations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
2. International Chamber of Commerce
3. UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development)
4. EFTA (European Free Trade Association)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. World Trade Organization
6. NAFTA
7. European Union
8. ASEAN Free Trade Area
9. Mercosur
10. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
11. African Continental Free Trade Area
12. Caribbean Community
13. International Monetary Fund
14. World Bank
15. Bank for International Settlements
16. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
17. Commonwealth of Independent States
18. Pacific Alliance
19. Central European Free Trade Agreement
20. Gulf Cooperation Council
21. Southern African Development Community
22. East African Community
23. Eurasian Economic Union
24. Trans-Pacific Partnership

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
