Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Initial recorded instances of natural phenomena before the 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The first recorded sighting of Halley's Comet in 240 BC
2. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755
3. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79
4. The Great Storm of 1703 in England

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The discovery of penicillin in 1928
6. The first flight of the Wright brothers in 1903
7. The invention of the telephone in 1876
8. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912
9. The first moon landing in 1969
10. The discovery of DNA's structure in 1953
11. The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980
12. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986
13. The invention of the World Wide Web in 1989
14. The first use of an atomic bomb in 1945
15. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012
16. The invention of the steam engine in 1712
17. The first successful heart transplant in 1967
18. The discovery of Pluto in 1930
19. The invention of the light bulb in 1879
20. The first powered flight in 1903
21. The discovery of radioactivity in 1896
22. The first use of anesthesia in 1846
23. The invention of the printing press in 1440
24. The discovery of the electron in 1897

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
