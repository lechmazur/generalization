Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical systems that utilize real-time feedback control to adjust their damping characteristics in response to dynamic external stimuli.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Magnetorheological shock absorbers in high-end vehicle suspensions
2. Active noise-canceling headphones with adaptive microphone monitoring
3. Smart prosthetic limbs with variable impedance joints
4. Adaptive building dampers with real-time seismic response

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Conventional car shock absorbers
6. Automatic door closers
7. Traditional building shock absorbers
8. Spring-based mechanical dampers
9. Hydraulic elevator systems
10. Manual bicycle suspension forks
11. Fixed-rate tennis racquet dampeners
12. Passive vibration isolation tables
13. Regular foam padding in helmets
14. Static building foundation supports
15. Traditional car airbags
16. Regular foam mattresses
17. Standard running shoe cushioning
18. Fixed-weight gym equipment
19. Regular door hinges
20. Basic mechanical springs
21. Standard brake pads
22. Regular furniture cushions
23. Traditional car seats
24. Basic rubber mounting blocks

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
