Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or artificial systems that rely on external structures or mechanisms to maintain identity, stability, or function under stress or environmental change.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a coral reef
2. a suspension bridge
3. a beehive
4. a space station

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a tree
6. a river
7. a mountain
8. a cloud
9. a volcano
10. a glacier
11. a desert
12. a forest
13. a hurricane
14. a tornado
15. a thunderstorm
16. a waterfall
17. a canyon
18. a cave
19. a lake
20. an ocean
21. a star
22. a galaxy
23. a comet
24. a black hole

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
