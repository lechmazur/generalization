Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools designed for precise insertion or manipulation of small, delicate components within a larger assembly, utilizing a mechanism that concentrates force onto a small contact area.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A watchmaker's tweezers used to place a tiny screw into a watch movement.
2. A pair of fine-tipped forceps used by a surgeon to grasp and manipulate tissue during microsurgery.
3. A pick and place machine nozzle used to precisely position surface-mount electronic components onto a circuit board.
4. A dental explorer used to probe and examine teeth for cavities.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A hammer
6. A screwdriver
7. A wrench
8. A pliers
9. A scalpel
10. A sewing needle
11. A paintbrush
12. A pen
13. A magnifying glass
14. A microscope
15. A telescope
16. A robotic arm
17. A crane
18. A forklift
19. A backhoe
20. A syringe
21. A pipette
22. A stapler
23. A nail gun
24. A glue gun

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
