Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine elements of mythology, technology, and natural phenomena to create symbolic or functional hybrids.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A cybernetic phoenix that harnesses solar energy to regenerate and power advanced technology.
2. A trident-shaped satellite that controls weather patterns and symbolizes the power of the sea god.
3. A bioengineered tree that communicates through a network of roots, embodying the spirit of a forest deity.
4. A mechanical dragonfly that uses electromagnetic fields to mimic the mythical properties of flight and transformation.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smartphone with a sleek design inspired by ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.
6. A wind turbine painted with scenes from Greek mythology.
7. A genetically modified flower that changes color based on environmental conditions.
8. A robot designed to mimic the movements of a mythological creature.
9. A virtual reality game set in a world where technology and nature coexist harmoniously.
10. A sculpture that combines elements of modern architecture and ancient ruins.
11. A drone that monitors natural disasters and is named after a god of storms.
12. A wearable device that tracks fitness and is styled after a mythical amulet.
13. A painting that depicts a futuristic cityscape with elements of folklore.
14. A genetically engineered animal that glows in the dark, inspired by bioluminescent creatures.
15. A musical instrument that uses technology to replicate the sounds of nature.
16. A piece of jewelry that incorporates microchips and is designed to resemble a mythical creature.
17. A building that uses solar panels and is adorned with statues of gods and goddesses.
18. A video game where players control characters with powers derived from natural elements.
19. A car designed with aerodynamic shapes inspired by mythological birds.
20. A fashion line that combines traditional fabrics with modern technology.
21. A bridge that uses advanced materials and is named after a deity of travel.
22. A film that explores the relationship between technology and the natural world.
23. A piece of furniture that uses sustainable materials and is designed to resemble a mythical tree.
24. A software application that uses algorithms to predict weather patterns and is named after a weather god.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
