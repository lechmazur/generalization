Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations where entertainment and utility intersect through automated systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Automated checkout machines in movie theaters
2. Interactive digital kiosks in amusement parks
3. Self-service ticket vending machines at concert venues
4. Robotic bartenders in entertainment complexes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smart home devices
6. Automated toll booths
7. Self-driving cars
8. Automated factory assembly lines
9. Online streaming services
10. Video game consoles
11. Automated banking machines
12. Smartphones
13. Automated irrigation systems
14. Virtual reality headsets
15. Automated security systems
16. Smart thermostats
17. Automated warehouse robots
18. Augmented reality applications
19. Automated parking systems
20. Smart watches
21. Automated medical diagnostic tools
22. Home entertainment systems
23. Automated public transportation
24. Smart lighting systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
