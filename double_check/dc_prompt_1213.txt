Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or phenomena that emerged in the mid-20th century and fundamentally transformed the way humans interact with information or technology

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The transistor
2. The integrated circuit
3. The ARPANET
4. The barcode

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The printing press
6. The steam engine
7. The compass
8. The wheel
9. The telescope
10. The microscope
11. The radio
12. The television
13. The automobile
14. The airplane
15. The internet
16. The smartphone
17. The personal computer
18. The World Wide Web
19. The electric light bulb
20. The refrigerator
21. The washing machine
22. The phonograph
23. The camera
24. The elevator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
