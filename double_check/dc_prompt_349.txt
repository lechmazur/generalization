Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products first sold in California between 1970 and 1985 that were advertised on national television.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Atari 2600
2. Apple II
3. Mattel Intellivision
4. ColecoVision

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Commodore 64
6. Nintendo Entertainment System
7. Sega Master System
8. Texas Instruments TI-99/4A
9. RadioShack TRS-80
10. Sony Walkman
11. Polaroid OneStep
12. VCR
13. Betamax
14. Swatch watches
15. Rubik's Cube
16. Lego Space sets
17. Transformers toys
18. G.I. Joe action figures
19. He-Man action figures
20. My Little Pony toys
21. Cabbage Patch Kids
22. Trivial Pursuit
23. Pictionary
24. Simon game

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
