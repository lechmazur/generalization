Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures that utilize the natural flow of water for aesthetic or artistic effect, excluding fountains.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A series of cascading pools and channels built into a hillside garden, utilizing the natural slope to create a flowing water feature.
2. A rill in a Japanese garden, designed to mimic a natural stream bed and create a soothing sound.
3. A canal lock, where the controlled release of water creates a dynamic visual display.
4. A water staircase, where water flows down a series of steps, creating a visual and auditory experience.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A swimming pool
6. A dam
7. A fountain
8. A water park
9. A hydroelectric power plant
10. An irrigation system
11. A water wheel
12. A well
13. A bird bath
14. A fish pond
15. A jacuzzi
16. A waterslide
17. A river boat
18. A bridge over a stream
19. A waterfall (natural)
20. A geyser
21. Rain chains
22. A water clock
23. A decorative spout on a building
24. A koi pond with a pump

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
