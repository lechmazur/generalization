Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures where the Hausdorff dimension is used to quantify complexity or irregularity in their spatial or temporal organization.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The coastline of a country
2. The boundary of a fractal
3. The distribution of galaxies in the universe
4. The pattern of a lightning bolt

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a straight line
6. a perfect circle
7. a cube
8. a regular polygon
9. a smooth sphere
10. a chessboard
11. a regular grid
12. a highway
13. a skyscraper
14. a digital clock
15. a calendar
16. a ruler
17. a textbook
18. a piano
19. a bookshelf
20. a soccer field
21. a swimming pool
22. a football stadium
23. a tennis court
24. a baseball diamond

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
