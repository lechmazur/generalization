Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Volcanic rock formations used for cultural expressions in Pacific Island regions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Petroglyphs carved into basalt flows in Hawai'i
2. Stone adzes fashioned from obsidian in the Solomon Islands
3. Moai statues on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) constructed from volcanic tuff
4. Marae platforms in the Marquesas Islands built with basalt blocks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Coral used for building material
6. Sandstone carvings in Australia
7. Jade ornaments in New Zealand
8. Wood carvings in Papua New Guinea
9. Cave paintings in Indonesia
10. Granite tools in Japan
11. Limestone sculptures in Thailand
12. Marble statues in Greece
13. Clay pottery in Mexico
14. Bronze artifacts in China
15. Iron weapons in Africa
16. Gold jewelry in South America
17. Shell beads in North America
18. Ivory carvings in Europe
19. Textile designs in India
20. Basket weaving in the Philippines
21. Volcanic eruptions in Iceland
22. Obsidian arrowheads in North America
23. Geological formations in the Grand Canyon
24. Volcanic hot springs in New Zealand

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
