Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): natural or man-made formations that create optical illusions or visual distortions when viewed from specific angles or under certain lighting conditions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lake Sørvágsvatn in Faroe Islands
2. Devil's Bridge in Kromlau, Germany
3. Ames Room at San Francisco's Exploratorium
4. Richat Structure in Mauritania

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Grand Canyon
6. Niagara Falls
7. Mount Everest
8. Great Barrier Reef
9. Northern Lights
10. Giant's Causeway
11. Stonehenge
12. Taj Mahal
13. Great Wall of China
14. Victoria Falls
15. Antelope Canyon
16. Petra
17. Machu Picchu
18. Mount Rushmore
19. Moai Statues
20. Pyramids of Giza
21. Angel Falls
22. Uluru
23. Colosseum
24. Yellowstone Geysers

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
