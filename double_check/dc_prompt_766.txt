Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that become temporarily non-functional due to a predictable, cyclical event

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Street lights during a scheduled power outage
2. Air conditioners during a routine maintenance shutdown
3. Public fountains during winterization
4. Elevators during a fire drill

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A car needing repairs after an accident
6. A smartphone with a dead battery
7. A computer during a software update
8. A washing machine with a broken motor
9. A television during a blackout
10. A radio with a malfunctioning antenna
11. A lawnmower during the off-season
12. A bicycle with a flat tire
13. A printer out of ink
14. A camera with a cracked lens
15. A refrigerator during a power surge
16. A microwave with a faulty door switch
17. A dishwasher during a water shortage
18. A vacuum cleaner with a clogged filter
19. A coffee maker with a broken heating element
20. A toaster with a jammed lever
21. A blender with a shattered pitcher
22. A sewing machine with a tangled thread
23. A hair dryer with a burnt-out motor
24. A treadmill with a worn-out belt

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
