Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for extreme environments that have specialized compartments for storage or operation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Deep-sea submersible with a pressurized compartment for scientific equipment
2. Space suit with integrated storage for tools and samples
3. Arctic research vehicle with heated compartments for sensitive electronics
4. Firefighter's suit with specialized pockets for emergency tools

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Backpack designed for hiking
6. Waterproof phone case
7. Insulated lunch box
8. Safe for storing valuables
9. Car trunk organizer
10. Toolbox for home repairs
11. Travel suitcase with multiple compartments
12. Refrigerator with adjustable shelves
13. Desk with built-in drawers
14. Kitchen cabinet with pull-out organizers
15. File cabinet for office use
16. Jewelry box with compartments
17. Makeup case with various sections
18. Garage storage system
19. Closet organizer with shelves and drawers
20. First aid kit with compartments for supplies
21. Fishing tackle box
22. Art supply case with multiple sections
23. Tool belt for construction work
24. Portable sewing kit with compartments

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
