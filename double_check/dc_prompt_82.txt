Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that optimize processes through iterative approximation methods

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gradient Descent Algorithm
2. Simulated Annealing
3. Genetic Algorithms
4. Newton's Method

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Blockchain Technology
6. Quantum Computing
7. Virtual Reality
8. 3D Printing
9. Internet of Things (IoT)
10. Cloud Computing
11. Artificial Neural Networks
12. Augmented Reality
13. Big Data Analytics
14. Machine Learning
15. Natural Language Processing
16. Blockchain Smart Contracts
17. Edge Computing
18. Robotic Process Automation
19. 5G Technology
20. Cybersecurity Protocols
21. Facial Recognition Systems
22. Autonomous Vehicles
23. Wearable Technology
24. Biometric Authentication

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
