Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Medieval European festivals that evolved into modern music festivals while maintaining their original location

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Oktoberfest in Munich
2. Glastonbury Festival in Somerset
3. Notting Hill Carnival in London
4. La Tomatina in Bu√±ol

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Coachella in California
6. Burning Man in Nevada
7. Tomorrowland in Belgium
8. Woodstock in New York
9. Lollapalooza in Chicago
10. Roskilde Festival in Denmark
11. Rock in Rio in Brazil
12. Fuji Rock Festival in Japan
13. Primavera Sound in Barcelona
14. Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas
15. Ultra Music Festival in Miami
16. Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK
17. Download Festival in England
18. Isle of Wight Festival in the UK
19. Exit Festival in Serbia
20. Sziget Festival in Hungary
21. Bonnaroo in Tennessee
22. Governors Ball in New York
23. Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago
24. Austin City Limits in Texas

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
