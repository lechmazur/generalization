Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional characters who use precise, rule-based systems or knowledge to solve problems or achieve goals, often in high-stakes or supernatural contexts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sherlock Holmes using deductive reasoning to solve mysteries
2. Light Yagami using the Death Note's rules to achieve his goals
3. Hermione Granger using her extensive knowledge of spells and magical creatures to navigate challenges
4. Ender Wiggin using strategic military tactics to win battles

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Harry Potter using bravery and friendship to defeat Voldemort
6. Frodo Baggins relying on courage and perseverance to destroy the One Ring
7. Katniss Everdeen using survival skills and archery in the Hunger Games
8. Bilbo Baggins using cleverness and luck to outwit Smaug
9. Indiana Jones using physical prowess and quick thinking to recover artifacts
10. Luke Skywalker using the Force to defeat the Empire
11. James Bond using gadgets and combat skills to complete missions
12. Superman using his superpowers to save the world
13. Batman using his wealth and technology to fight crime
14. Wonder Woman using her strength and combat skills to protect humanity
15. Spider-Man using his agility and spider-sense to fight villains
16. Hercule Poirot using his "little grey cells" to solve crimes
17. Samwise Gamgee using loyalty and determination to support Frodo
18. Neo using his abilities as "The One" to fight against the Matrix
19. Buffy Summers using her Slayer powers to fight vampires
20. Rick Grimes using leadership and survival skills in a post-apocalyptic world
21. Jon Snow using honor and leadership to unite the North
22. Daenerys Targaryen using her dragons and political acumen to claim the Iron Throne
23. Jack Sparrow using cunning and charm to navigate pirate adventures
24. Aragorn using his heritage and leadership to reclaim the throne of Gondor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
