Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional tools or instruments that require rhythmic precision but are not primarily used for creating music.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. metronome
2. sewing machine
3. loom
4. typewriter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. drum
6. guitar
7. piano
8. flute
9. violin
10. harmonica
11. trumpet
12. accordion
13. clarinet
14. saxophone
15. banjo
16. cello
17. trombone
18. harp
19. bagpipes
20. ukulele
21. maracas
22. tambourine
23. xylophone
24. kazoo

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
