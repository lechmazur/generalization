Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Coastal towns in Cornwall with populations under 2,000 that have historical sites related to reclaiming land from the sea

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Charlestown
2. Polperro
3. Mousehole
4. Portloe

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. St Ives
6. Newquay
7. Falmouth
8. Padstow
9. Penzance
10. Truro
11. Marazion
12. St Michael's Mount
13. Land's End
14. Looe
15. Mevagissey
16. St Mawes
17. Fowey
18. Helston
19. Redruth
20. Hayle
21. Wadebridge
22. Launceston
23. Bodmin
24. Saltash

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
