Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Single-use items made of non-biodegradable materials that are commonly found in environmental waste surveys.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. plastic drinking straw
2. disposable lighter
3. styrofoam coffee cup
4. plastic shopping bag

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. cardboard box
6. glass bottle
7. aluminum can
8. paper napkin
9. cotton t-shirt
10. wooden pencil
11. metal fork
12. ceramic plate
13. bamboo chopsticks
14. steel water bottle
15. cloth shopping bag
16. paper coffee cup
17. metal straw
18. glass food container
19. wooden cutlery
20. biodegradable trash bag
21. canvas tote
22. silicon food storage bag
23. stainless steel razor
24. cork coaster

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
