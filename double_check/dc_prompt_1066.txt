Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or functional creations that mimic natural forms through the use of artificial materials or techniques.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. silk flowers in a glass vase
2. faux marble countertops
3. plastic topiary bushes
4. ceramic wood-look flooring

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. pressed leaves in a scrapbook
6. dried flower arrangements
7. seashell collection
8. mounted butterfly display
9. natural wood furniture
10. cotton fabric
11. leather shoes
12. wool sweater
13. bamboo cutting board
14. stone sculpture
15. clay pottery
16. woven basket
17. pressed wood panels
18. glass terrarium
19. botanical drawings
20. nature photographs
21. carved wooden birds
22. paper origami flowers
23. metal wind chimes
24. straw hat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
