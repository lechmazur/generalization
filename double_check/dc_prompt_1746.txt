Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or systems designed for efficient water distribution in agriculture that incorporate advanced technology for conservation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. drip irrigation systems with soil moisture sensors
2. automated sprinkler systems with weather-based scheduling
3. smart water valves controlled by IoT platforms
4. precision irrigation systems using satellite imagery

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a garden hose
6. a watering can
7. a rain barrel
8. a hand pump
9. a flood irrigation system
10. a water wheel
11. a desalination plant
12. a water filtration system
13. a hydroponic setup
14. a water storage tank
15. a water recycling system
16. a water well
17. a water meter
18. a water softener
19. a water aerator
20. a water fountain
21. a water cooler
22. a water purifier
23. a water pump
24. a water sprinkler without automation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
