Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Processes or systems that utilize a pulsed, cyclical release of a regulating substance to control a downstream, non-cyclical process.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Insulin release from the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels.
2. A chemical batch reactor where a catalyst is added in pulses to control the reaction rate.
3. A drip irrigation system that delivers water to plants in short bursts.
4. The release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, stimulating LH and FSH release from the pituitary gland.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A car's cruise control system.
6. A thermostat regulating room temperature.
7. A traffic light cycle.
8. The menstrual cycle.
9. Tidal patterns.
10. Seasonal changes in temperature.
11. A metronome keeping time in music.
12. A geyser erupting periodically.
13. A heart beating.
14. Breathing.
15. Peristalsis in the digestive system.
16. Circadian rhythms.
17. A pendulum swinging.
18. A washing machine cycle.
19. The rotation of the Earth.
20. A factory assembly line.
21. A continuous flow chemical reactor.
22. A sprinkler system for lawn irrigation.
23. A constant intravenous drip of medication.
24. The water cycle.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
