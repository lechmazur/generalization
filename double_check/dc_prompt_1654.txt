Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Biological processes that temporarily suspend development or growth specifically to avoid unfavorable environmental conditions while maintaining the ability to resume normal function when conditions improve

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tardigrade cryptobiosis
2. Plant seed dormancy
3. Bacterial spore formation
4. Bear hibernation

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Molting in crustaceans
6. Leaf color change in autumn
7. Snake skin shedding
8. Coral bleaching
9. Plant wilting
10. Migration of birds
11. Aestivation in snails
12. Deciduous tree leaf drop
13. Cell death
14. Metamorphosis in insects
15. Growth rings in trees
16. Seasonal coat changes
17. Root growth stoppage
18. Cellular senescence
19. Reproductive diapause
20. Brumation in reptiles
21. Bud dormancy
22. Estivation in lungfish
23. Cell cycle arrest
24. Winter fur development

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
