Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): natural phenomena that significantly impact air travel due to atmospheric disturbances

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Clear-air turbulence
2. Volcanic ash clouds
3. Geomagnetic storms
4. Heavy thunderstorms

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bird strikes
6. Mechanical failures
7. Pilot error
8. Air traffic control issues
9. Terrorism
10. Cyberattacks
11. Pandemics
12. Economic downturns
13. Airport closures due to snow
14. Fog
15. Low visibility due to dust storms
16. Heavy rain
17. Strong winds (not associated with thunderstorms or other atmospheric disturbances)
18. Extreme temperatures
19. Runway incursions
20. Cabin depressurization
21. Fuel shortages
22. Labor strikes
23. Wildlife on the runway
24. Lightning strikes (without the context of a thunderstorm)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
