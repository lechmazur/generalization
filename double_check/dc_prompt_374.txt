Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative carvings on functional, human-powered watercraft

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Intricate wooden carvings on the bow of a traditional Polynesian outrigger canoe
2. Elaborate floral patterns carved into the sides of a Venetian gondola
3. Detailed animal figures carved on the stern of a Native American birchbark canoe
4. Ornate geometric designs carved into the hull of a traditional Chinese dragon boat

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Carvings on a wooden sailing ship
6. Decorative engravings on a motorboat
7. Ornamental carvings on a cruise ship
8. Carved designs on a surfboard
9. Intricate patterns on a paddle
10. Decorative carvings on a wooden dock
11. Carved figures on a fishing net
12. Ornamental designs on a life jacket
13. Carvings on a wooden oar
14. Decorative engravings on a yacht
15. Carved patterns on a kayak paddle
16. Ornamental carvings on a wooden bridge
17. Intricate designs on a sail
18. Carvings on a wooden anchor
19. Decorative patterns on a rowboat seat
20. Ornamental engravings on a wooden buoy
21. Carved figures on a wooden fishing rod
22. Intricate designs on a wooden ship's wheel
23. Decorative carvings on a wooden pier
24. Ornamental patterns on a wooden lifeboat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
