Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Kitchen utensils made of a single piece of hammered copper with a decorative, non-functional silver inlay.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A ladle with a swirling silver inlay along the handle
2. A spatula with a geometric silver inlay near the base
3. A whisk with a floral silver inlay on the handle
4. A tong with a linear silver inlay on one arm

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A stainless steel frying pan with a copper handle
6. A copper pot with a silver lid
7. A set of copper measuring spoons with engraved silver markings
8. A copper mixing bowl with a silver-plated interior
9. A copper colander with silver handles
10. A copper grater with a silver frame
11. A copper rolling pin with silver end caps
12. A copper can opener with a silver cutting wheel
13. A copper garlic press with silver accents
14. A copper ice cream scoop with a silver handle
15. A copper vegetable peeler with a silver blade
16. A copper corkscrew with a silver spiral
17. A copper cheese slicer with a silver wire
18. A copper egg separator with a silver ring
19. A copper lemon juicer with a silver reamer
20. A copper pastry brush with silver bristles
21. A copper bottle opener with a silver lever
22. A copper nutcracker with silver jaws
23. A copper pie server with a silver edge
24. A copper kitchen shears with silver blades

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
