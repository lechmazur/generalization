Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials used in contemporary art that change appearance under different lighting conditions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Dichroic glass
2. Photochromic pigments
3. Thermochromic paint
4. Fluorescent acrylics

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Oil paint
6. Clay
7. Bronze
8. Marble
9. Charcoal
10. Graphite
11. Watercolor
12. Paper
13. Canvas
14. Wood
15. Steel
16. Glass (non-dichroic)
17. Plastic
18. Fabric
19. Found objects
20. Video projections
21. Performance art
22. Installation art
23. Digital art
24. LED lights

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
