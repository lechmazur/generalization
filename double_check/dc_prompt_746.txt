Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional settings where technology is powered by biological organisms or processes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Matrix's human batteries powering the machine world
2. Lexx's living spaceship controlled by organic technology
3. Farscape's biomechanoid Leviathan ships
4. The organic power cores in Final Fantasy VII's Mako reactors

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Island of Dr. Moreau's hybrid creatures
6. Jurassic Park's cloned dinosaurs
7. Avatar's neural interface with nature
8. Star Trek's biological weapons
9. District 9's alien technology
10. Resident Evil's viral mutations
11. BioShock's genetic modifications
12. Prey's alien organic matter
13. Half-Life's biological experiments
14. Alien's xenomorph hive
15. Pacific Rim's kaiju organs
16. Prototype's viral abilities
17. Dead Space's alien artifacts
18. Mass Effect's organic ships
19. Metroid's biological weapons
20. Doom's demon technology
21. Gears of War's locust horde
22. System Shock's cyber-biological fusion
23. Halo's Flood parasites
24. Starcraft's Zerg structures

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
