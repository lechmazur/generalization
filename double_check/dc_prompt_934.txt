Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic works that incorporate biological structures to create visual or auditory illusions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. M.C. Escher's "Sky and Water I" woodcut print
2. The Blooming Zoetrope sculpture series by John Edmark
3. Cymatics art installations by Nigel Stanford
4. The Living Line animation series by Cameron Robbins

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Van Gogh's Sunflowers
6. Georgia O'Keeffe's flower paintings
7. Ernst Haeckel's scientific illustrations
8. The DNA double helix sculpture at Cold Spring Harbor
9. Damien Hirst's preserved shark
10. Andy Goldsworthy's leaf arrangements
11. The Giant's Causeway photographs
12. Fibonacci sequence visualizations
13. Butterfly wing microscope photographs
14. Crystal growth time-lapse videos
15. Pressed flower artwork
16. Coral reef sculptures
17. Bone architecture drawings
18. Tree ring paintings
19. Shell spiral photographs
20. Leaf skeleton art
21. Bird song spectrograms
22. Microscopic cell photography
23. DNA portrait art
24. Bacterial culture designs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
