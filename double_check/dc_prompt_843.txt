Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural elements that incorporate celestial motifs to symbolize time cycles

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a sundial with zodiac symbols
2. a clock tower featuring a rotating astrolabe
3. a cathedral rose window depicting the phases of the moon
4. a temple frieze illustrating the movement of constellations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a stained glass window with floral patterns
6. a modern skyscraper with geometric designs
7. a mosaic depicting a historical battle
8. a fountain with water jets timed to music
9. a bridge with arches inspired by Roman aqueducts
10. a pavilion with a retractable roof
11. a sculpture of a mythological creature
12. a building facade with abstract art
13. a lighthouse with a spiral staircase
14. a garden maze with hedges shaped like animals
15. a monument honoring a historical figure
16. a theater with a proscenium arch
17. a library with a domed ceiling
18. a museum exhibit showcasing ancient pottery
19. a clock with Roman numerals
20. a courtyard with a central fountain
21. a temple with columns inspired by Greek architecture
22. a tower with a weather vane
23. a building with a green roof
24. a pavilion with a thatched roof

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
