Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring geological formations that exhibit columnar jointing composed primarily of basalt.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Giant's Causeway
2. Devil's Postpile
3. Fingal's Cave
4. Svartifoss

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Delicate Arch
6. Marble Caves of Chile
7. Antelope Canyon
8. Wave Rock
9. Uluru
10. Grand Canyon
11. Bryce Canyon
12. Carlsbad Caverns
13. Mammoth Cave
14. White Cliffs of Dover
15. Moeraki Boulders
16. The Pinnacles Desert
17. Chocolate Hills
18. Stone Forest
19. Monument Valley
20. Cave of Crystals
21. Pamukkale
22. Zhangjiajie Stone Forest
23. Vermilion Cliffs
24. Petra

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
