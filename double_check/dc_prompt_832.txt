Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that facilitate real-time decision-making through data analysis and user interaction

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A stock trading platform that analyzes market data and executes trades based on pre-set parameters and real-time user adjustments.
2. A self-driving car system that processes sensor data to make instantaneous navigation decisions, allowing for manual overrides by the driver.
3. A smart traffic management system that adjusts traffic light timings dynamically based on real-time traffic flow and pedestrian movement, with options for manual intervention by traffic operators.
4. A hospital patient monitoring system that provides real-time vital signs and alerts medical staff to critical changes, enabling immediate intervention based on the data and physician assessment.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weather forecasting website.
6. A customer relationship management (CRM) system.
7. A social media analytics dashboard.
8. A business intelligence reporting tool.
9. A database management system.
10. A data warehouse.
11. Machine learning algorithms for image recognition.
12. Statistical software for data analysis.
13. A flight simulator.
14. A video game with real-time elements.
15. A GPS navigation system.
16. A heart rate monitor.
17. A smart thermostat.
18. A home security system.
19. An online survey platform.
20. An e-commerce website with product recommendations.
21. A music streaming service with personalized playlists.
22. A video conferencing platform.
23. An online learning platform.
24. A project management software.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
