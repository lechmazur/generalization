Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena where two distinct biological entities engage in a competitive interaction that results in a dynamic equilibrium, influenced by external environmental factors.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Wolves and deer populations in a forest ecosystem
2. Coral and algae in a coral reef
3. Predatory birds and small mammals in a grassland
4. Ants and aphids on a plant

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bees pollinating flowers
6. Symbiotic relationship between clownfish and sea anemones
7. Photosynthesis in plants
8. Migration of birds
9. Parasitic wasps laying eggs in caterpillars
10. Mutualistic relationship between humans and gut bacteria
11. Fungi decomposing organic matter
12. Fish swimming in schools
13. Camouflage in chameleons
14. Pollution affecting marine life
15. Seasonal hibernation of bears
16. Photosynthetic algae in aquatic environments
17. Seed dispersal by wind
18. Formation of rainbows
19. Lightning strikes during a storm
20. Formation of sand dunes
21. Volcanic eruptions
22. Earthquakes
23. Formation of glaciers
24. Ocean currents

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
