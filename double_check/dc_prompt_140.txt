Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or tools that convert continuous physical motion into discrete, countable units of measurement

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Turnstile
2. Water meter
3. Odometer
4. Anemometer (with cups)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Speedometer
6. Thermometer
7. Barometer
8. Ruler
9. Scale
10. Clock
11. Stopwatch
12. GPS
13. Compass
14. Microphone
15. Camera
16. Projector
17. Telescope
18. Microscope
19. Binoculars
20. Magnifying glass
21. Laser pointer
22. Light bulb
23. Battery
24. Electric motor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
