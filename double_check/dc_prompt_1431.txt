Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that were historically used as currency but are now primarily valued for their therapeutic or medicinal properties

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Salt
2. Tea
3. Cacao beans
4. Ginseng

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gold
6. Silver
7. Shells
8. Spices
9. Paper money
10. Cryptocurrency
11. Barley
12. Livestock
13. Iron
14. Wheat
15. Rice
16. Amber
17. Ivory
18. Glass beads
19. Cloth
20. Obsidian
21. Furs
22. Alcohol
23. Wood
24. Leather

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
