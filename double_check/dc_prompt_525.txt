Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate a naturally-occurring mirrored form or pattern derived from bilateral symmetry in a living organism, but exclude objects explicitly designed for viewing one's own reflection.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. butterfly-shaped hair clip
2. leaf-inspired table design
3. shell-shaped soap dish
4. fish-shaped serving platter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. compact mirror
6. round wall clock
7. oval picture frame
8. heart-shaped pendant
9. star-shaped cookie cutter
10. rectangular bookshelf
11. circular rug
12. triangular road sign
13. square window
14. hexagonal tile
15. spiral staircase
16. cylindrical vase
17. octagonal gazebo
18. diamond-shaped kite
19. pyramid-shaped paperweight
20. crescent moon lamp
21. trapezoidal table
22. elliptical mirror
23. pentagon-shaped clock
24. rhombus-shaped window

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
