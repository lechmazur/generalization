Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring transparent minerals that were historically used as windows before the widespread adoption of glass

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. selenite
2. muscovite mica
3. alabaster
4. quartz

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. obsidian
6. amber
7. diamond
8. opal
9. jade
10. lapis lazuli
11. malachite
12. turquoise
13. fluorite
14. pyrite
15. hematite
16. gypsum
17. feldspar
18. calcite
19. talc
20. graphite
21. corundum
22. zircon
23. topaz
24. garnet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
