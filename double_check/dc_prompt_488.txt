Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects originally designed for a specific, utilitarian purpose that have been repurposed as decorative art in private residences.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. an old wooden ladder used as a bookshelf
2. a vintage bicycle wheel turned into a wall clock
3. a wine barrel converted into a coffee table
4. an antique door repurposed as a dining table

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a painting of a landscape
6. a sculpture of a horse
7. a modern art installation
8. a decorative vase
9. a framed photograph
10. a crystal chandelier
11. a ceramic figurine
12. a woven tapestry
13. a glass paperweight
14. a decorative mirror
15. a hand-carved wooden statue
16. a silk flower arrangement
17. a metal wall art piece
18. a decorative throw pillow
19. a porcelain tea set
20. a marble bust
21. a stained glass window
22. a hand-painted ceramic plate
23. a decorative wall sconce
24. a bronze fountain

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
