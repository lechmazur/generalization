Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that incorporate circular or radial symmetry to serve a functional or symbolic purpose in human culture or design.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a compass rose
2. a Buddhist mandala
3. a radar display
4. a ship's wheel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a spiral staircase
6. a DNA helix
7. a pinwheel
8. a tornado
9. a galaxy
10. a whirlpool
11. a ferris wheel
12. a clock pendulum
13. a merry-go-round
14. a vinyl record
15. a CD
16. a tire
17. a ring
18. a bracelet
19. a hula hoop
20. a frisbee
21. a plate
22. a bowl
23. a coin
24. a button

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
