Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Games or activities that involve both chance and skill, where the outcome can be influenced by strategic decisions but is also subject to random elements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Poker
2. Chess with a random move generator
3. Backgammon
4. Fantasy sports drafting

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Marathon running
6. Chess
7. Lottery
8. Video game speedrunning
9. Swimming
10. Sudoku
11. Roulette
12. Competitive eating
13. Figure skating
14. Jeopardy
15. Baseball
16. Cooking competition
17. Archery
18. Scrabble
19. Gymnastics
20. Stock market investing
21. Bridge
22. Slot machines
23. Debating
24. Go

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
