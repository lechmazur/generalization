Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): platforms or systems that facilitate the exchange or distribution of resources, information, or services, often through centralized or decentralized mechanisms, and whose names derive from ancient or historical references.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Amazon
2. Oracle
3. Hermes
4. Atlas

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Google
6. Facebook
7. Twitter
8. LinkedIn
9. Snapchat
10. Instagram
11. WhatsApp
12. Spotify
13. Netflix
14. Uber
15. Airbnb
16. Zoom
17. Slack
18. Reddit
19. eBay
20. PayPal
21. Dropbox
22. GitHub
23. Salesforce
24. Shopify

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
