Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or activities that require circular motion and are used in competitive or artistic contexts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a figure skater performing a spin
2. a discus thrower in athletics
3. a rhythmic gymnast using a hoop
4. a breakdancer executing a windmill

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bicycle wheel
6. a washing machine drum
7. a ceiling fan
8. a merry-go-round
9. a record player
10. a fidget spinner
11. a yo-yo
12. a car tire
13. a clock's second hand
14. a revolving door
15. a planet orbiting the sun
16. a mixer's blades
17. a wind turbine
18. a potter's wheel
19. a centrifuge
20. a carousel
21. a gyroscope
22. a helicopter's rotor
23. a spinning top
24. a drill bit

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
