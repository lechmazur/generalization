Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations in assistive technology that mimic natural human functions and were developed before the 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the Jaipur foot, a prosthetic limb designed in the 19th century to mimic natural walking
2. the Braille writing system, developed in the 1820s to enable tactile reading for the blind
3. the ear trumpet, an early hearing aid used in the 17th century to amplify sound
4. the mechanical hand prosthesis created by Ambroise Par√© in the 16th century

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a modern cochlear implant
6. a robotic exoskeleton
7. a voice-activated home assistant
8. a smart cane with GPS navigation
9. a 3D-printed prosthetic arm
10. a wheelchair with stair-climbing capabilities
11. a text-to-speech software
12. a bionic eye implant
13. a wearable fitness tracker
14. a virtual reality headset for therapy
15. a smartwatch with health monitoring features
16. a speech-generating device
17. an AI-powered hearing aid
18. a robotic surgery assistant
19. a self-driving car
20. a brain-computer interface
21. a smart prosthetic leg with sensors
22. a haptic feedback glove
23. a drone for delivering medical supplies
24. a telepresence robot

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
