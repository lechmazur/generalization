Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mythical or legendary locations believed to be the origin or center of a significant cultural or religious narrative

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Kailash
2. The Garden of Eden
3. Atlantis
4. Paititi

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mecca
6. Jerusalem
7. The Vatican
8. Stonehenge
9. The Pyramids of Giza
10. Area 51
11. Loch Ness
12. The Bermuda Triangle
13. Mount Olympus
14. Asgard
15. Avalon
16. Shangri-La
17. El Dorado
18. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
19. The Library of Alexandria
20. The Colossus of Rhodes
21. The Great Wall of China
22. Machu Picchu
23. Teotihuacan
24. Nazca Lines

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
