Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations from the 19th century that significantly improved efficiency in transportation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Bessemer process
2. The development of the steam locomotive
3. Macadam road construction
4. The invention of the propeller

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the airplane
6. The development of the automobile
7. The creation of the internet
8. The invention of the telephone
9. The discovery of penicillin
10. The development of the telegraph
11. The invention of the light bulb
12. The development of photography
13. The invention of the phonograph
14. The discovery of X-rays
15. The development of reinforced concrete
16. The invention of the diesel engine
17. The development of the electric motor
18. The invention of the radio
19. The development of plastics
20. The invention of the television
21. The development of nuclear power
22. The invention of the computer
23. The development of the internet
24. The invention of the smartphone

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
