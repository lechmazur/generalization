Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures who were overthrown and subsequently became symbols of tyranny in literature or folklore

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. King Richard III of England
2. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia
3. Emperor Nero of Rome
4. King Louis XVI of France

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Queen Elizabeth I of England
6. George Washington
7. Cleopatra VII of Egypt
8. Alexander the Great
9. Julius Caesar
10. Napoleon Bonaparte
11. Queen Victoria
12. Abraham Lincoln
13. Genghis Khan
14. Charlemagne
15. Queen Mary I of England
16. King Henry VIII of England
17. Joan of Arc
18. Martin Luther King Jr.
19. Winston Churchill
20. Queen Isabella I of Castile
21. King Solomon
22. Attila the Hun
23. Leonardo da Vinci
24. Thomas Jefferson

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
