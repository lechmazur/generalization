Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Circular stone monuments in North America that were built before 1800 and used for ceremonial or astronomical purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Bighorn Medicine Wheel
2. Cahokia Woodhenge
3. Majorville Medicine Wheel
4. Miami Circle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge
6. Callanish Stones
7. Newgrange
8. Serpent Mound
9. Poverty Point
10. Newark Earthworks
11. Chaco Canyon
12. Mesa Verde
13. Machu Picchu
14. Teotihuacan
15. Chichen Itza
16. Gobekli Tepe
17. Carnac stones
18. Great Zimbabwe
19. Ring of Brodgar
20. Avebury
21. Knowth
22. Dowth
23. Woodhenge (England)
24. Rollright Stones

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
