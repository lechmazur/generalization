Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products that were first advertised on The Simpsons and are still sold today.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Buzz Cola
2. Duff Beer
3. Squishee frozen drinks
4. Ribwich sandwich

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Krusty-O's cereal
6. Mr. Sparkle detergent
7. Tomacco
8. Flaming Moe's cocktail
9. Lisa's Little Lady Duff
10. Krusty Burger
11. Duff Gardens theme park
12. Malk
13. Crab Juice
14. Nuts and Gum
15. Lady Krusty mustache removal cream
16. Dimoxinil
17. Powersauce bars
18. Motherloving Sugar Corporation
19. Laramie cigarettes
20. Monstromart
21. Farmer Billy's Bacon
22. Uncle Jim's Country Fillin's
23. Southern Cracker
24. Duff Dry

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
