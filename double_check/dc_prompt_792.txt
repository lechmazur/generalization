Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Phenomena or objects that involve a transition between two distinct states or environments, marked by a visible or perceptible boundary or gradient.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a river flowing into the ocean
2. a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly
3. a sunrise marking the transition from night to day
4. a door separating an indoor space from an outdoor space

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a cloud
6. a mountain
7. a tree
8. a rock
9. a star
10. a rainbow
11. a volcano
12. a glacier
13. a desert
14. a forest
15. a waterfall
16. a canyon
17. a cave
18. a lake
19. a beach
20. a meadow
21. a thunderstorm
22. a tornado
23. a hurricane
24. a snowflake

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
