Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Human-made systems or materials that undergo a transformation process to mitigate environmental harm or repurpose waste into useful or neutral forms.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. wastewater treatment plant
2. plastic bottle recycling facility
3. catalytic converter
4. composting bin system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. natural wetlands
6. solar panels
7. wind turbines
8. bamboo forest
9. electric car
10. reusable shopping bag
11. ocean current
12. biodegradable packaging
13. coral reef
14. rainwater barrel
15. mangrove swamp
16. paper straw
17. bicycle
18. cotton tote bag
19. peat bog
20. metal water bottle
21. algae bloom
22. geothermal vent
23. LED lightbulb
24. hemp fabric

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
