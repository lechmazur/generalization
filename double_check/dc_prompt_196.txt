Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): devices with visual indicators for operational status used in vertical transportation systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A lighted up/down arrow adjacent to an elevator door
2. A digital display showing the current floor of an escalator
3. An illuminated "out of service" sign on a moving walkway
4. A flashing light indicating a fire alarm activation on a lift

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A fuel gauge in a car
6. A battery indicator on a phone
7. A traffic light
8. A "power on" light on a computer
9. A thermostat displaying the current temperature
10. A progress bar on a software download
11. A washing machine cycle indicator
12. A doorbell with a flashing light
13. A smoke detector with a blinking LED
14. A fire alarm pull station with a lit indicator
15. A railway signal
16. A GPS device showing current location
17. A smart watch displaying heart rate
18. A hospital patient monitor
19. A pressure gauge on a gas cylinder
20. A speedometer in a vehicle
21. A windsock at an airport
22. A digital clock displaying the time
23. A warning light on a car dashboard
24. A "low battery" indicator on a remote control

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
