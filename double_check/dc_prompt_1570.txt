Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Manufacturing processes that remove material in a precise pattern to create functional channels or pathways within solid objects

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chemical etching of microfluidic devices
2. Wire EDM cutting of cooling channels in molds
3. Laser drilling of fuel injector nozzles
4. CNC milling of hydraulic manifold passages

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Casting molten metal into shaped molds
6. 3D printing layer by layer
7. Welding metal pieces together
8. Injection molding plastic parts
9. Stamping holes in sheet metal
10. Carving wood sculptures
11. Grinding metal surfaces smooth
12. Drilling simple holes
13. Cutting threads for screws
14. Polishing optical lenses
15. Sand blasting surfaces
16. Forging metal shapes
17. Extruding plastic profiles
18. Rolling metal sheets
19. Drawing wire through dies
20. Powder metallurgy pressing
21. Glass blowing vessels
22. Spinning metal cylinders
23. Bending tubes and pipes
24. Brazing metal joints

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
