Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts that explore the intersection of predetermined structure and emergent behavior within a defined system.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Conway's Game of Life
2. Stock market trading algorithms
3. Ant colony pheromone trails
4. Neural network learning patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A chess game
6. Traffic patterns
7. Weather systems
8. Social media trends
9. Computer programming
10. Democracy
11. Factory assembly line
12. Musical composition
13. Language evolution
14. City planning
15. DNA replication
16. School curriculum
17. Restaurant menu
18. Sports leagues
19. Military hierarchy
20. Internet protocols
21. Calendar systems
22. Banking regulations
23. Fashion trends
24. Ecosystem dynamics

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
