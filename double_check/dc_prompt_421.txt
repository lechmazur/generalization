Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems of symbolic representation that utilize a 12-element cycle to categorize and interpret aspects of the natural world or human experience.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Chinese zodiac cycle used to assign animal signs to years, influencing personality traits and compatibility.
2. The 12 houses in Western astrology, each representing different areas of life and personal development.
3. The 12 Jyotirlingas in Hindu mythology, representing sacred sites dedicated to the deity Shiva.
4. The 12 months of the Gregorian calendar, each associated with specific seasonal changes and cultural events.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The seven chakras in yogic traditions, representing energy centers in the body.
6. The four classical elements (earth, water, air, fire) used in ancient philosophies to explain the natural world.
7. The five elements in Chinese cosmology (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) used to describe interactions and transformations.
8. The eight trigrams of the I Ching, used for divination and understanding cosmic principles.
9. The ten sefirot in Kabbalistic teachings, representing aspects of the divine and the universe.
10. The nine planets of the solar system, used in astrology to influence personality and events.
11. The six realms of existence in Buddhist cosmology, describing different states of being.
12. The three gunas in Hindu philosophy (sattva, rajas, tamas), representing qualities of nature and consciousness.
13. The five Platonic solids, used in ancient Greek philosophy to represent the elements.
14. The seven days of the week, each named after celestial bodies or deities in various cultures.
15. The four seasons, used to describe cyclical changes in nature and human life.
16. The five senses, used to categorize human perception and interaction with the world.
17. The eight phases of the moon, used in various cultures for timing rituals and events.
18. The seven colors of the rainbow, used to represent the spectrum of visible light.
19. The ten commandments in Judeo-Christian tradition, used as moral and ethical guidelines.
20. The five pillars of Islam, representing the core practices of the faith.
21. The four directions (north, east, south, west), used in various cultures for navigation and symbolism.
22. The three primary colors (red, blue, yellow), used in art and design to create other colors.
23. The six tastes in Ayurvedic medicine (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, astringent), used to balance health.
24. The seven deadly sins in Christian theology, representing moral failings to be avoided.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
