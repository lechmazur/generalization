Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Competitive target-based sports or games where the scoring object must pass through a suspended ring or hoop positioned above ground level

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a basketball passing through a hoop
2. a netball shot through a ring
3. a ringette disk passing through a vertical ring
4. a korfball shot through a basket

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a soccer goal
6. a hockey puck sliding into a net
7. a dart hitting a bullseye
8. a golf ball landing in a hole
9. a baseball being hit out of the park
10. a cricket ball hitting the stumps
11. a rugby ball crossing the try line
12. a volleyball spiked over a net
13. a badminton shuttlecock landing inbounds
14. a tennis ball landing in the service box
15. a bowling ball knocking down pins
16. a curling stone stopping in the house
17. a lacrosse ball entering the goal
18. a water polo ball crossing the goal line
19. a handball thrown into the net
20. a table tennis ball landing on the opponent's side
21. a squash ball hitting the front wall
22. a javelin landing in the field
23. a discus landing within the sector
24. a shot put landing in the marked area

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
