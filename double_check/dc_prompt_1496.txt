Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient infrastructure projects that were later repurposed into modern transportation or utility corridors

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The ancient Roman road, Via Appia, sections of which are now used as modern roads and bike paths.
2. The Erie Canal towpath, now part of the Empire State Trail for recreational use.
3. The ancient Persian Royal Road, parts of which are integrated into modern highways in Iran.
4. The ancient aqueducts of Segovia, Spain, some of which have been converted into pedestrian walkways.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ancient ruins converted into museums.
6. Modern highways built over ancient battlefields.
7. Historical sites used for film locations.
8. Ancient city walls turned into tourist attractions.
9. Old railway tracks converted into hiking trails.
10. Medieval castles repurposed as hotels.
11. Ancient temples used for religious ceremonies.
12. Historical forts used for military reenactments.
13. Old factories converted into residential lofts.
14. Ancient irrigation systems studied for archaeological research.
15. Historical bridges maintained as heritage sites.
16. Old mining tunnels used for tourism.
17. Ancient amphitheaters used for modern performances.
18. Historical lighthouses converted into museums.
19. Old school buildings repurposed as community centers.
20. Ancient burial sites used for educational tours.
21. Historical prisons turned into tourist attractions.
22. Old churches converted into concert venues.
23. Ancient marketplaces used for modern commerce.
24. Historical ships turned into floating museums.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
