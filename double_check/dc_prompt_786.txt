Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional rituals involving marine animals that are integral to the cultural identity of indigenous Arctic or sub-Arctic peoples

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The use of whale bones in ceremonial dances by the Inuit people.
2. The traditional seal hunting rituals performed by the Yupik people before the hunt.
3. The narwhal tusk used in ceremonial exchanges among the Inuvialuit.
4. The walrus skin boat launching ceremony practiced by the Chukchi people.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Annual fishing festivals in coastal communities.
6. Traditional dances involving animal costumes in various cultures.
7. Ceremonial use of feathers in Native American rituals.
8. Rituals involving domesticated animals in agricultural societies.
9. Use of animal symbols in totem poles by Pacific Northwest tribes.
10. Harvest festivals celebrating agricultural abundance.
11. Rituals involving the use of reindeer in Sami culture.
12. Traditional hunting practices of the Maori people.
13. Ceremonial use of eagle feathers in Plains Indian cultures.
14. Rituals involving the use of horses in Mongolian culture.
15. Traditional fishing techniques used by Polynesian peoples.
16. Ceremonial use of bear claws in some Native American tribes.
17. Rituals involving the use of cattle in African pastoral societies.
18. Traditional whale watching tours in modern coastal towns.
19. Ceremonial use of tortoise shells in some African cultures.
20. Rituals involving the use of sheep in Middle Eastern cultures.
21. Traditional use of salmon in Pacific Northwest tribal ceremonies.
22. Ceremonial use of buffalo in Great Plains tribal cultures.
23. Rituals involving the use of goats in some Caribbean cultures.
24. Traditional use of deer in some European folk rituals.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
