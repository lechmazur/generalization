Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Species that went extinct due to direct human activity after the year 1500 CE.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Great Auk
2. Passenger Pigeon
3. Caribbean Monk Seal
4. Steller's Sea Cow

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Saber-toothed Tiger
6. Woolly Mammoth
7. Dodo Bird
8. Tasmanian Tiger
9. American Lion
10. Giant Ground Sloth
11. Irish Elk
12. Cave Bear
13. Quagga
14. Mastodon
15. Giant Moa
16. Dire Wolf
17. Western Black Rhinoceros
18. Baiji Dolphin
19. Golden Toad
20. Pyrenean Ibex
21. Carolina Parakeet
22. Atlas Bear
23. Japanese Sea Lion
24. Heath Hen

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
