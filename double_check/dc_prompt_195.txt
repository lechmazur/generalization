Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): 19th-century scientific discoveries that significantly impacted evolutionary theory

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick
2. The formulation of the theory of natural selection by Charles Darwin
3. The discovery of Mendelian inheritance by Gregor Mendel
4. The publication of "On the Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the steam engine by James Watt
6. The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming
7. The development of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev
8. The discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen
9. The formulation of the laws of thermodynamics
10. The discovery of the electron by J.J. Thomson
11. The invention of the telegraph by Samuel Morse
12. The discovery of radioactivity by Marie Curie
13. The development of the germ theory of disease by Louis Pasteur
14. The invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell
15. The discovery of the planet Neptune by Johann Galle
16. The development of the Bessemer process for steel production
17. The discovery of the law of conservation of energy by Julius Robert Mayer
18. The invention of the dynamo by Michael Faraday
19. The discovery of the comet Halley by Edmond Halley
20. The development of the theory of electromagnetism by James Clerk Maxwell
21. The invention of the internal combustion engine by Nikolaus Otto
22. The discovery of the greenhouse effect by Joseph Fourier
23. The development of the theory of relativity by Albert Einstein
24. The invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
