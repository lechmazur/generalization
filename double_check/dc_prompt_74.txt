Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional garments that symbolize social status and are used in diplomatic contexts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kente cloth worn by Ashanti chiefs during state ceremonies
2. Imperial hanfu robes worn by Chinese envoys in ancient diplomatic missions
3. Ermine-trimmed parliamentary robes of British House of Lords members
4. Sacred feathered headdresses of Native American tribal leaders in peace treaties

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Wedding kimono
6. Military dress uniform
7. Graduation gown
8. Religious priest's vestments
9. Corporate business suit
10. Traditional folk dance costume
11. Royal crown
12. Judge's robe
13. Olympic athlete uniform
14. Theater costume
15. Traditional burial shroud
16. Carnival festival dress
17. School uniform
18. Traditional hunting garment
19. Ceremonial mask
20. Traditional farming clothes
21. Ancient warrior armor
22. Traditional fishing outfit
23. Ritual dancing costume
24. Traditional craftsman's apron

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
