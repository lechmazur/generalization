Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures exhibiting visible, naturally-occurring mineralization of organic material, where the original organic form is largely preserved.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Petrified wood
2. Dinosaur bone
3. Fossil ammonite
4. Opalized belemnite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Quartz crystal
6. Granite
7. Coal
8. Stalactite
9. Moldavite
10. Amber
11. Pyrite
12. Coprolite
13. Trace fossil (like a footprint)
14. Oil shale
15. Geode
16. Fulgurite
17. Obsidian
18. Petrified nest
19. Dinosaur egg
20. Opal
21. Iron ore
22. Limestone
23. Concretion
24. Mud cracks (preserved in rock)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
