Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical locations where automated sorting systems intersect with unplanned human pathways

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A busy airport baggage claim area where passengers cut across automated conveyor belt paths
2. A warehouse loading dock where forklifts cross automated guided vehicle routes
3. A grocery store self-checkout area where shoppers intersect with robotic cart return paths
4. A library's automated book sorting room where staff walkways cross conveyor tracks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A subway platform
6. An automated parking garage
7. A self-driving car testing facility
8. A robotic assembly line
9. A pedestrian crosswalk
10. An automated farm harvesting field
11. A package sorting facility
12. A train station ticket gate
13. A hospital corridor
14. An automated storage facility
15. A shopping mall escalator
16. A factory production line
17. A drive-through car wash
18. An automated toll booth
19. A vending machine area
20. A post office sorting room
21. A theme park ride queue
22. A bus terminal
23. A school hallway
24. A supermarket checkout line

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
