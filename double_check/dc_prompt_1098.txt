Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): technological advancements that enable the visualization or manipulation of microscopic or otherwise imperceptible phenomena

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Electron microscope
2. X-ray crystallography
3. Atomic force microscopy
4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Telescope
6. Binoculars
7. Magnifying glass
8. Microscope slide
9. Petri dish
10. Thermometer
11. Barometer
12. Seismograph
13. Spectrometer
14. Camera
15. Sonar
16. Radar
17. GPS
18. High-speed camera
19. 3D printing
20. Virtual Reality headset
21. Augmented Reality glasses
22. Laser pointer
23. Fiber optic cable
24. Bluetooth technology

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
