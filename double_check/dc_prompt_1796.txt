Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographical locations named after mythological or legendary figures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Troy, New York
2. Odessa, Texas
3. Phoenix, Arizona
4. Athens, Georgia

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Paris, France
6. Rome, Italy
7. London, England
8. Tokyo, Japan
9. New York, USA
10. Sydney, Australia
11. Cairo, Egypt
12. Moscow, Russia
13. Beijing, China
14. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
15. Berlin, Germany
16. Madrid, Spain
17. Delhi, India
18. Mexico City, Mexico
19. Johannesburg, South Africa
20. Toronto, Canada
21. Singapore
22. Dubai, UAE
23. Amsterdam, Netherlands
24. Stockholm, Sweden

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
