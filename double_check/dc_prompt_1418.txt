Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Minerals that were named after ancient Greek deities and are still actively mined today

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chalcopyrite
2. Pyrite
3. Hematite
4. Galena

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Quartz
6. Feldspar
7. Mica
8. Calcite
9. Gypsum
10. Halite
11. Talc
12. Barite
13. Bauxite
14. Dolomite
15. Fluorite
16. Kaolinite
17. Magnetite
18. Serpentine
19. Sphalerite
20. Zeolite
21. Copper
22. Gold
23. Silver
24. Iron

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
