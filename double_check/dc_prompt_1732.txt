Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Urban installations that integrate renewable energy sources and provide public amenities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Solar-powered bus stops with charging stations and seating
2. Wind turbine-equipped park benches with USB ports
3. Solar-paneled pedestrian bridges with lighting and Wi-Fi
4. Rainwater-harvesting sculptures with solar-powered fountains

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Solar panels on residential rooftops
6. Wind farms in rural areas
7. Hydropower dams
8. Geothermal heating systems for homes
9. Biomass energy plants
10. Electric vehicle charging stations
11. Solar-powered streetlights
12. Public parks without energy features
13. Traditional playgrounds
14. Urban murals and graffiti art
15. Underground subway systems
16. Bicycle-sharing stations
17. Outdoor fitness equipment
18. Public fountains without renewable energy
19. Urban community gardens
20. Skate parks
21. Public libraries
22. Outdoor amphitheaters
23. Traditional street furniture like benches and trash bins
24. Urban plazas with no energy integration

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
