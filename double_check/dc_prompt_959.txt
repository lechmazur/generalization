Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic creations that mimic natural forms to convey a satirical message about human behavior

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A sculpture of ants carrying dollar bills to represent greed and materialism
2. A painting of peacocks wearing business suits to mock vanity in corporate culture
3. A ceramic piece showing butterflies made of credit cards to critique consumerism
4. A wire sculpture of sheep in human clothing following each other off a cliff

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A realistic bronze statue of a lion
6. A watercolor painting of flowers
7. A photograph of birds in flight
8. An abstract painting inspired by ocean waves
9. A ceramic vase with leaf patterns
10. A political cartoon of arguing politicians
11. A marble sculpture of a Greek goddess
12. A wooden carving of tree branches
13. A satirical newspaper comic strip
14. A glass sculpture of raindrops
15. A mural of urban life
16. An oil painting of a sunset
17. A caricature of a celebrity
18. A metal sculpture of geometric shapes
19. A digital artwork of space exploration
20. A mosaic of river patterns
21. An editorial cartoon about politics
22. A textile print of animal patterns
23. A charcoal drawing of mountains
24. A stained glass window of birds

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
