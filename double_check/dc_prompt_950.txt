Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Iconic figures known for their distinctive androgynous style and contributions to both music and visual arts in the late 20th century.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. David Bowie
2. Annie Lennox
3. Grace Jones
4. Prince

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Madonna
6. Elton John
7. Freddie Mercury
8. Lady Gaga
9. Marilyn Manson
10. Cher
11. Kurt Cobain
12. Björk
13. Michael Jackson
14. Janelle Monáe
15. Boy George
16. Iggy Pop
17. Patti Smith
18. Lou Reed
19. Debbie Harry
20. Robert Smith
21. Siouxsie Sioux
22. Marc Bolan
23. Brian Eno
24. Kate Bush

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
