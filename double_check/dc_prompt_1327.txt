Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or man-made formations that are named after a specific color and are located underground or beneath a surface.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Blue Grotto
2. The Red Cave
3. The Black Hole of Calcutta
4. The Green Lake

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Grand Canyon
6. The White Cliffs of Dover
7. The Golden Gate Bridge
8. The Pink Sands Beach
9. The Silver Falls
10. The Yellow River
11. The Emerald Isle
12. The Black Forest
13. The Red Sea
14. The Blue Lagoon
15. The White House
16. The Green Mountains
17. The Black Sea
18. The Golden Temple
19. The Pink City
20. The Silver Lake
21. The Yellow Submarine
22. The Emerald City
23. The Blue Ridge Mountains
24. The Red Square

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
