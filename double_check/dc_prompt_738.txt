Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that were initially deemed impossible but later achieved by a single pioneering individual or team

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Wright brothers achieving powered flight at Kitty Hawk
2. Alexander Graham Bell's first telephone transmission
3. Chester Carlson inventing xerography
4. George Eastman creating roll film photography

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Manhattan Project
6. NASA's Apollo Program
7. The development of penicillin
8. The invention of the steam engine
9. The creation of the internet
10. Development of the polio vaccine
11. The first computer mouse
12. The invention of television
13. Discovery of X-rays
14. The first microprocessor
15. Development of GPS technology
16. The first artificial satellite
17. Creation of the World Wide Web
18. The first nuclear reactor
19. Development of radar technology
20. The first laser
21. Invention of the transistor
22. The first artificial heart
23. Development of fiber optics
24. The creation of nylon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
