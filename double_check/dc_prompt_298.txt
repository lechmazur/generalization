Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products that utilize a specific variety of Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis miller) as the primary active ingredient and are marketed primarily for topical skin application.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel
2. Seven Minerals Pure Aloe Vera Gel
3. Green Leaf Naturals Aloe Vera Gel
4. Nature Republic Soothing & Moisture Aloe Vera Gel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Aloe Vera juice drink
6. Aloe ferox gel cream
7. Aloe arborescens extract
8. Cucumber gel moisturizer
9. Tea tree oil cream
10. Aloe vera capsules
11. Calendula healing ointment
12. Aloe vera shampoo
13. Witch hazel toner
14. Aloe vera toothpaste
15. Coconut oil moisturizer
16. Aloe vera mouthwash
17. Shea butter lotion
18. Aloe vera hand sanitizer
19. Chamomile skin cream
20. Aloe vera soap
21. Lavender body lotion
22. Aloe vera face wash
23. Eucalyptus healing balm
24. Aloe vera sunscreen

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
