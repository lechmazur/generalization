Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographical features or objects that are naturally concave and have been historically or culturally significant as gathering or ceremonial spaces.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stonehenge
2. Delphi
3. Chaco Canyon
4. Gobekli Tepe

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mount Everest
6. Amazon River
7. Grand Canyon
8. Niagara Falls
9. Great Barrier Reef
10. Mount Fuji
11. Lake Baikal
12. Yellowstone National Park
13. Victoria Falls
14. Amazon Rainforest
15. Mount Kilimanjaro
16. Angel Falls
17. Gal√°pagos Islands
18. Serengeti Plains
19. Great Wall of China
20. Uluru
21. Loch Ness
22. Dead Sea
23. Yosemite Valley
24. Antarctic Ice Sheet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
