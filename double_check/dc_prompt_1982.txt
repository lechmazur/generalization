Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artworks commissioned by religious institutions between 1400 and 1600 AD that depict scenes from the Old Testament

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo
2. The Sacrifice of Isaac by Caravaggio
3. The Story of Joseph by Pontormo
4. The Expulsion from Paradise by Masaccio

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci
6. The School of Athens by Raphael
7. The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli
8. The Annunciation by Fra Angelico
9. The Transfiguration by Raphael
10. The Assumption of the Virgin by Titian
11. The Madonna of the Rocks by Leonardo da Vinci
12. The Last Judgment by Michelangelo
13. The Adoration of the Magi by Botticelli
14. The Baptism of Christ by Verrocchio
15. The Coronation of the Virgin by Fra Angelico
16. The Crucifixion by Tintoretto
17. The Resurrection by Piero della Francesca
18. The Deposition by Rogier van der Weyden
19. The Presentation of the Virgin by Titian
20. The Visitation by Pontormo
21. The Nativity by Piero della Francesca
22. The Descent from the Cross by Rubens
23. The Marriage of the Virgin by Raphael
24. The Conversion of Saint Paul by Caravaggio

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
