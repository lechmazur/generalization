Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): architectural structures designed to mimic natural geological formations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Lotus Temple in New Delhi, India
2. The Stone Forest Geological Park in Kunming, China
3. The Wave Rock in Western Australia
4. The Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Sydney Opera House in Australia
6. The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France
7. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE
8. The Colosseum in Rome, Italy
9. The Great Wall of China
10. The Taj Mahal in Agra, India
11. The Statue of Liberty in New York, USA
12. The Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy
13. The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, Spain
14. The Parthenon in Athens, Greece
15. The Louvre Museum in Paris, France
16. The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, USA
17. The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
18. The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey
19. The Machu Picchu in Peru
20. The Tower Bridge in London, UK
21. The Kremlin in Moscow, Russia
22. The Angkor Wat in Cambodia
23. The Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany
24. The Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
