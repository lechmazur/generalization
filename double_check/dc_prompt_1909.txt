Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that use real-time data to optimize resource allocation in dynamic environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a traffic management system that adjusts signal timings based on live vehicle flow data
2. a smart grid that dynamically balances electricity supply and demand using real-time consumption data
3. a ride-sharing platform that optimizes driver routes and passenger pickups using live GPS data
4. a warehouse automation system that reallocates robots based on real-time inventory and order data

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a weather forecasting app that predicts rain based on historical data
6. a fitness tracker that monitors daily step count
7. a static inventory management system for a retail store
8. a manual scheduling tool for employee shifts
9. a traditional irrigation system with fixed timers
10. a GPS navigation app that provides static route suggestions
11. a basic thermostat with pre-set temperature schedules
12. a non-adaptive public transportation timetable
13. a manual traffic light system with fixed intervals
14. a standard email filtering system based on pre-defined rules
15. a static pricing model for an e-commerce platform
16. a traditional library catalog system
17. a basic home security system with motion sensors
18. a manual resource allocation tool for project management
19. a non-adaptive energy-saving mode on a laptop
20. a standard recommendation system for movies based on user history
21. a fixed-speed conveyor belt in a factory
22. a traditional landline telephone system
23. a manual voting system with paper ballots
24. a static classroom seating arrangement

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
