Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional greeting customs involving physical contact with the head or face

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a bow where the forehead touches the ground
2. a kiss on the cheek as a greeting
3. a forehead-to-forehead touch in some cultures
4. a nose rub as a traditional greeting

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a handshake
6. a high-five
7. a wave
8. a fist bump
9. a hug
10. a pat on the back
11. a nod of the head
12. a thumbs-up gesture
13. a curtsy
14. a salute
15. a bow without physical contact
16. a verbal greeting
17. a hand over the heart
18. a clap
19. a finger snap
20. a wink
21. a blowing of a kiss
22. a hand gesture like "peace"
23. a namaste gesture
24. a hand on the chest

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
