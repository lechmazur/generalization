Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Animated films featuring a protagonist who discovers a hidden world or civilization through a portal or passage concealed within a natural landscape.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Coraline discovers a hidden world behind a small door in her new home, which leads to an alternate version of her life.
2. Jake Sully enters the world of Pandora through a neural link, discovering the Na'vi civilization.
3. Alice falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland, a fantastical world hidden beneath the surface.
4. Chihiro enters the spirit world through a tunnel, discovering a bathhouse run by spirits.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A young boy discovers a magical train that takes him to a school of witchcraft and wizardry.
6. A girl finds a wardrobe that leads her to a magical land filled with mythical creatures.
7. A character stumbles upon a time-traveling device that transports them to different eras.
8. A protagonist enters a virtual reality game and explores a digital world.
9. A boy discovers a secret society living beneath the city through an old subway tunnel.
10. A character finds a magic mirror that shows them alternate realities.
11. A girl discovers a hidden room in her house that contains a portal to another dimension.
12. A protagonist enters a dream world through a special device that controls dreams.
13. A character finds a hidden cave that leads to an underground city.
14. A boy discovers a magical book that transports him to different worlds when he reads it.
15. A girl finds a hidden door in her school that leads to a parallel universe.
16. A protagonist enters a fantasy world through a magical amulet.
17. A character discovers a hidden laboratory that contains a time machine.
18. A boy finds a secret passage in his attic that leads to a world of adventure.
19. A girl discovers a hidden island that is home to a lost civilization.
20. A protagonist enters a magical forest through a hidden path and meets enchanted creatures.
21. A character finds a hidden elevator that takes them to a futuristic city.
22. A boy discovers a secret tunnel in his backyard that leads to a world of dinosaurs.
23. A girl finds a hidden staircase in her library that leads to a world of books come to life.
24. A protagonist enters a hidden realm through a magical painting.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
