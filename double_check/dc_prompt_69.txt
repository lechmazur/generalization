Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials or technologies developed in the 20th century that significantly enhanced personal safety in high-risk professions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kevlar body armor
2. Self-contained breathing apparatus
3. Fire-resistant Nomex fabric
4. Safety-toe composite materials

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. leather gloves
6. steel helmets
7. rubber boots
8. safety goggles
9. cotton overalls
10. wooden scaffolding
11. brass tools
12. iron chains
13. bronze shields
14. asbestos suits
15. wool blankets
16. canvas harnesses
17. copper wire mesh
18. aluminum ladders
19. silk ropes
20. glass face shields
21. hemp safety nets
22. tin protective covers
23. lead radiation shields
24. bamboo scaffolds

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
