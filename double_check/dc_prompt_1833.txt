Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or materials designed to protect against or mitigate the effects of ionizing radiation in space environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Polyethylene shielding panels
2. Water-filled double hull compartments
3. Aluminum-boron composite layers
4. Hydrogenated graphene sheets

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lead aprons
6. Concrete bunker walls
7. UV-protective coating
8. Heat shield tiles
9. Meteor impact barriers
10. Solar wind deflectors
11. Thermal insulation blankets
12. Radiation therapy room lining
13. X-ray protective glass
14. Nuclear power plant containment
15. EMF blocking fabric
16. Microwave shielding mesh
17. Radio frequency barriers
18. Vacuum chamber walls
19. Pressure vessel reinforcement
20. Solar panel protective films
21. Atmospheric re-entry shields
22. Particle accelerator shielding
23. Radar absorbing materials
24. Faraday cage mesh

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
