Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials or systems that exhibit both ordered and disordered structures simultaneously, enabling unique functional properties.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. liquid crystals
2. block copolymers
3. quasicrystals
4. amorphous metals

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. diamond
6. graphite
7. table salt
8. sand
9. rubber
10. glass
11. plastic
12. steel
13. water
14. ice
15. granite
16. marble
17. concrete
18. wood
19. ceramic
20. copper
21. aluminum
22. gold
23. silicon
24. carbon fiber

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
