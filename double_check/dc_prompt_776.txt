Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or entities that combine traditional craftsmanship with supernatural abilities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A sword forged by an ancient blacksmith that grants its wielder the power to control fire
2. A handwoven tapestry that reveals hidden truths when touched
3. A ceramic vase that can purify any liquid placed inside it
4. A wooden flute carved by a master craftsman that can summon rain when played

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smartphone with advanced AI capabilities
6. A genetically engineered plant that glows in the dark
7. A futuristic car that can drive itself
8. A digital watch that can track your health metrics
9. A painting that changes colors based on the viewer's mood
10. A robot designed to mimic human emotions
11. A book that updates its content automatically
12. A virtual reality headset that simulates different environments
13. A drone that can deliver packages autonomously
14. A genetically modified fruit that never spoils
15. A pair of glasses that can translate languages in real-time
16. A computer program that predicts stock market trends
17. A solar-powered flashlight
18. A digital camera with facial recognition technology
19. A smart home system that learns your preferences
20. A holographic display that projects 3D images
21. A fitness tracker that monitors your sleep patterns
22. A self-cleaning oven
23. A voice-activated personal assistant
24. A high-tech security system with motion sensors

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
