Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for human use that incorporate a flexible, segmented structure primarily for controlled manipulation of their shape or position.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. gooseneck desk lamp
2. bendy drinking straw
3. adjustable phone mount
4. flexible tripod

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. chain necklace
6. rope ladder
7. bicycle chain
8. beaded curtain
9. charm bracelet
10. paper clip chain
11. zipper
12. venetian blinds
13. watch band
14. measuring tape
15. train cars
16. domino chain
17. linked fence
18. paper garland
19. bead string
20. extension cord
21. shower curtain rings
22. dog leash
23. key ring
24. belt

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
