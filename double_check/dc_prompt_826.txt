Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that incorporate intricate patterns to create a visual or sensory illusion of depth or complexity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Guilloch√© engraving on a watch
2. A fractal image generated by a computer
3. An Op Art painting
4. A woven tapestry with a trompe-l'oeil design

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A spider web
6. A snowflake
7. A fingerprint
8. A circuit board
9. A honeycomb
10. A tiled mosaic floor
11. A city skyline
12. A branching tree
13. A river delta
14. A nautilus shell
15. A sunflower head
16. A pinecone
17. A human eye
18. A peacock feather
19. Camouflage patterns on an animal
20. A kaleidoscope image
21. A stained glass window
22. A topographical map
23. A QR code
24. A beaded necklace

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
