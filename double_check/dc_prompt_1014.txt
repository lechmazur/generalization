Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine precision engineering with cultural or artistic expression, resulting in a functional yet aesthetically significant outcome.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stradivarius violin
2. Swiss mechanical watch
3. Japanese tea ceremony tools
4. Art Deco elevator doors

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Computer processor
6. Oil painting
7. Marble sculpture
8. Digital camera
9. Industrial robot
10. Crystal vase
11. Pottery wheel
12. Microscope
13. Bronze statue
14. Telescope
15. Stained glass window
16. Printing press
17. Decorative sword
18. Steam engine
19. Grandfather clock
20. Tapestry loom
21. Glass blowing tools
22. Surgical instruments
23. Calligraphy pen
24. Ancient sundial

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
