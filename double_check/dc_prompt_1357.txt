Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or tools that combine traditional craftsmanship with modern digital or industrial techniques to create functional or artistic works.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A handcrafted wooden clock with a laser-engraved design and a digital time display.
2. A pottery vase with 3D-printed geometric patterns and a traditional glaze finish.
3. A leather-bound journal with digitally printed pages and hand-stitched binding.
4. A hand-carved wooden sculpture with integrated LED lighting and programmable color changes.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional hand-woven rug.
6. A mass-produced plastic toy.
7. A digital painting created entirely on a computer.
8. A hand-knitted scarf.
9. A CNC-machined metal part for industrial use.
10. A 3D-printed model of a historical artifact.
11. A hand-blown glass vase.
12. A digitally animated film.
13. A traditional oil painting.
14. A mass-produced ceramic mug.
15. A hand-sewn quilt.
16. A digitally designed and printed poster.
17. A hand-carved wooden chess set.
18. A 3D-printed prosthetic limb.
19. A traditional pottery wheel.
20. A digitally controlled robotic arm for manufacturing.
21. A hand-forged iron gate.
22. A digitally rendered architectural model.
23. A hand-stitched leather wallet.
24. A mass-produced electronic device.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
