Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Phenomena or concepts where the perception or measurement of a property changes based on the relative motion or position of the observer or source.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The frequency of a siren changes as the ambulance passes you.
2. The color of a star shifts depending on its velocity relative to Earth.
3. The length of a spaceship appears shorter when it travels at near-light speed.
4. The time elapsed on a fast-moving spacecraft is different from the time elapsed on Earth.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A mirage in the desert.
6. The apparent size of the moon when it's near the horizon.
7. A rainbow forming after a rain shower.
8. The bending of light as it passes through a prism.
9. The perceived temperature difference between wood and metal at the same temperature.
10. The change in pitch of a guitar string when tightened.
11. The volume of a sound decreasing with distance.
12. The brightness of a light bulb changing with voltage.
13. The color of an object appearing different under various lighting conditions.
14. The weight of an object on different planets.
15. The speed of sound in different mediums.
16. The boiling point of water at different altitudes.
17. The expansion of metal when heated.
18. The perceived loudness of a sound based on individual hearing sensitivity.
19. The taste of food changing with temperature.
20. The smell of a perfume becoming fainter over time.
21. The feeling of warmth from a fire decreasing with distance.
22. The appearance of a stick submerged in water.
23. The distortion of an image through a curved lens.
24. The change in color of a chameleon to match its surroundings.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
