Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools used by craftsmen that are named after their primary function and made from a single piece of wood

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a chisel
2. a mallet
3. a plane
4. a gouge

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a hammer with a wooden handle
6. a saw with a metal blade
7. a screwdriver made of metal
8. a drill with multiple parts
9. a wrench named after its inventor
10. a pliers with two metal pieces
11. a level with a liquid-filled vial
12. a tape measure with a retractable metal tape
13. a trowel made of metal
14. a brush with bristles and a handle
15. a tool named after its shape rather than function
16. a tool made from multiple pieces of wood
17. a tool made from plastic
18. a tool used by artists rather than craftsmen
19. a tool that is not named after its primary function
20. a tool made from metal and wood combined
21. a tool used in gardening
22. a tool used in cooking
23. a tool used in electronics
24. a tool used in automotive repair

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
