Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or systems that fundamentally challenge or redefine traditional binary classifications in their respective fields.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Quantum superposition in physics, which challenges the binary notion of a particle existing in a single, definite state.
2. The concept of the cyborg in sociology and philosophy, blurring the lines between human and machine.
3. Non-binary gender identities, which challenge the traditional male/female dichotomy.
4. Fuzzy logic in mathematics and computer science, which allows for degrees of truth beyond the binary true/false.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The theory of evolution
6. The concept of gravity
7. Digital vs. Analog
8. The wave-particle duality of light
9. The concept of artificial intelligence
10. The nature vs. nurture debate
11. The mind-body problem
12. Introversion vs. Extroversion
13. Classical mechanics
14. The Big Bang theory
15. The concept of time
16. The scientific method
17. The concept of space
18. The theory of relativity
19. Online vs. Offline
20. The concept of emotions
21. The concept of consciousness
22. Virtual Reality
23. Augmented Reality
24. The concept of free will

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
