Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that use internal lattice structures to provide strength while minimizing material usage

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. 3D printed titanium bicycle frame
2. Aerospace component made with selective laser melting
3. Custom orthopedic implant designed with additive manufacturing
4. Heat exchanger with optimized internal structure

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer
6. Honeycomb structure in a beehive
7. Truss bridge design
8. Geodesic dome
9. Foam core sandwich panel
10. Corrugated cardboard
11. Reinforced concrete beam
12. Steel I-beam
13. Wooden truss
14. Spider web
15. Bird bone structure
16. Plant stem
17. Coral skeleton
18. Fish scale
19. Leaf vein pattern
20. Human bone structure
21. Automotive chassis
22. Aircraft wing spar
23. Wind turbine blade
24. Ship hull

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
