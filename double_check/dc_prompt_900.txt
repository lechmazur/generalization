Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools that measure or manipulate physical dimensions and are primarily made of a single type of synthetic material

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a plastic tape measure
2. a nylon caliper
3. a polycarbonate ruler
4. a polyethylene micrometer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wooden yardstick
6. a metal protractor
7. a glass thermometer
8. a fabric tape measure
9. a steel ruler
10. a ceramic caliper
11. a leather measuring tape
12. a brass micrometer
13. a rubber level
14. a composite material square
15. a multi-material vernier caliper
16. a tool that measures weight
17. a device that measures temperature
18. a tool that measures volume
19. a tool made of multiple synthetic materials
20. a tool that measures time
21. a tool that measures electrical conductivity
22. a tool that measures humidity
23. a tool that measures light intensity
24. a tool that measures sound levels

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
