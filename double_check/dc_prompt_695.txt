Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that significantly altered human communication methods in the 21st century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. smartphones with instant messaging apps
2. social media platforms enabling global connectivity
3. video conferencing tools for real-time communication
4. voice-activated virtual assistants for hands-free interaction

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the printing press
6. telegraph machines
7. radio broadcasting
8. television sets
9. typewriters
10. landline telephones
11. fax machines
12. postal mail systems
13. carrier pigeons
14. smoke signals
15. semaphore flags
16. Morse code devices
17. pagers
18. dial-up internet
19. early email systems
20. CB radios
21. walkie-talkies
22. newspapers
23. magazines
24. cave paintings

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
