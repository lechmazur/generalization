Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Temporary accommodation networks that rely on reciprocal hosting arrangements between strangers and use reputation-based trust systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a platform where users can offer their spare rooms to travelers in exchange for future stays in other users' homes
2. a network where members earn points by hosting others and can redeem those points for stays elsewhere
3. a system where users build trust through reviews and ratings to facilitate short-term stays in shared spaces
4. a community-based service where strangers exchange lodging based on mutual agreements and verified reputations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a hotel booking website
6. a long-term rental apartment listing
7. a timeshare property exchange
8. a vacation home rental platform
9. a hostel dormitory booking system
10. a couch-surfing app without reputation tracking
11. a bed and breakfast reservation service
12. a corporate housing provider
13. a camping site reservation system
14. a luxury villa rental platform
15. a home exchange program without user reviews
16. a student housing network
17. a peer-to-peer car rental service
18. a shared office space booking platform
19. a pet-sitting exchange network
20. a ride-sharing app with driver ratings
21. a meal-sharing service with host reviews
22. a local tour guide booking platform
23. a freelance work exchange network
24. a community garden plot rental system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
