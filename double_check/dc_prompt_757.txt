Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that were initially developed for military purposes but later became widely used in civilian life.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. GPS technology
2. Microwave oven
3. Internet
4. Duct tape

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphone
6. Electric car
7. Television
8. Refrigerator
9. Air conditioning
10. Washing machine
11. Personal computer
12. Bluetooth technology
13. Digital camera
14. LED light bulb
15. 3D printing
16. Solar panels
17. Electric toothbrush
18. Smartwatch
19. Video game console
20. Streaming services
21. Voice-activated assistants
22. Hybrid vehicles
23. Wireless charging
24. Smart home devices

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
