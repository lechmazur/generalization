Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural systems or objects that exhibit a slow, gradual transformation over time due to environmental conditions, resulting in a visibly altered state or structure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a river carving a canyon over millennia
2. a tree growing thicker bark over decades
3. a mountain range eroding into hills over eons
4. a coral reef expanding and changing shape over centuries

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis
6. a volcano erupting
7. a seed sprouting into a plant
8. a glacier melting rapidly due to climate change
9. a fruit ripening on a tree
10. a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly
11. a lightning strike splitting a tree
12. a forest fire altering a landscape
13. a rock being crushed into sand by machinery
14. a flower blooming in spring
15. a sand dune shifting in a storm
16. a river flooding a valley
17. a landslide reshaping a hillside
18. a meteor impact creating a crater
19. a snowstorm covering a landscape
20. a tree falling in a storm
21. a lake drying up in a drought
22. a geyser erupting
23. a tornado altering a town
24. a tsunami reshaping a coastline

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
