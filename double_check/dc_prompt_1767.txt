Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): man-made structures that incorporate living plants as integral functional components

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A building with a green wall designed to filter air pollutants
2. A bridge with embedded planters that support the structure and provide habitat for pollinators
3. A wastewater treatment facility that uses constructed wetlands to purify water
4. A self-sufficient vertical farm incorporated into a skyscraper

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A park with trees and flowers
6. A wooden fence covered in vines
7. A birdhouse
8. A greenhouse
9. A hydroponic garden
10. A log cabin
11. A garden shed
12. A flower pot
13. A botanical garden
14. A compost bin
15. A terrarium
16. A raised garden bed
17. A trellis
18. A hanging basket
19. A window box
20. A field of crops
21. An orchard
22. A forest
23. A rooftop garden with potted plants
24. A green roof with a separate waterproof membrane

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
