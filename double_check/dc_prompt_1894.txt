Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographical locations named after different rivers that share the same name across continents

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Thames, New Zealand
2. Seine, Canada
3. Amazon, United States
4. Danube, Australia

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hudson, New York
6. Mississippi, United States
7. Yangtze, China
8. Ganges, India
9. Nile, Egypt
10. Rhine, Germany
11. Volga, Russia
12. Amazon, Brazil
13. Thames, England
14. Seine, France
15. Danube, Europe
16. Yarra, Australia
17. Loire, France
18. Colorado, United States
19. Indus, Pakistan
20. Tagus, Spain
21. Po, Italy
22. Elbe, Germany
23. Shannon, Ireland
24. Fraser, Canada

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
