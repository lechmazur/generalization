Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that incorporate both avant-garde design principles and functional elements inspired by speculative fiction genres.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A building with fluid, organic curves resembling a spaceship, featuring solar panel arrays shaped like alien wings.
2. A skyscraper with a gravity-defying cantilevered design, incorporating holographic displays and AI-driven environmental controls.
3. A museum with a fractal-like exterior and interior spaces that simulate zero-gravity environments for immersive art installations.
4. A residential complex with modular, transformable units inspired by futuristic habitats, blending seamlessly with augmented reality interfaces.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A Gothic cathedral with intricate stained glass windows.
6. A traditional Japanese tea house with sliding paper doors.
7. A Roman aqueduct with stone arches.
8. A modern glass office building with open floor plans.
9. A medieval castle with turrets and a moat.
10. A geodesic dome used as a greenhouse.
11. A Brutalist concrete apartment complex.
12. A Victorian-era mansion with ornate woodwork.
13. A minimalist Scandinavian cabin with wooden interiors.
14. A neoclassical government building with columns and a dome.
15. A postmodern art museum with asymmetrical shapes.
16. A colonial-style house with a wrap-around porch.
17. A high-tech research facility with cleanroom environments.
18. A Renaissance palace with frescoed ceilings.
19. A prefabricated modular home with eco-friendly materials.
20. A futuristic-looking airport terminal with sweeping curves.
21. A traditional adobe house in the Southwest.
22. A steel-framed skyscraper with a glass curtain wall.
23. A log cabin in a forest setting.
24. A contemporary art gallery with white walls and track lighting.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
