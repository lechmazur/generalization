Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Medical procedures that were first successfully performed in identical twins before being attempted between non-related individuals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Living donor kidney transplant
2. Bone marrow transplant
3. Skin graft
4. Liver transplant from a living donor

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Blood transfusion
6. Heart transplant
7. Lung transplant
8. Cornea transplant
9. In vitro fertilization
10. Caesarean section
11. Appendectomy
12. Tonsillectomy
13. Vaccination
14. Antibiotic treatment
15. Chemotherapy
16. Radiation therapy
17. Plastic surgery
18. Dental implant
19. Cochlear implant
20. Pacemaker implantation
21. Joint replacement surgery
22. Organ donation from a deceased donor
23. Gene therapy
24. Stem cell therapy

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
