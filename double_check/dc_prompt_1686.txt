Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or patterns that appear simple at first glance but reveal increasingly detailed self-similar structures when magnified at least three times

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A head of Romanesco broccoli
2. A coastline on a map
3. The branching pattern of a fern leaf
4. A snowflake

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A nautilus shell
6. A tree
7. A river system
8. A human circulatory system
9. A crystal cave
10. A spiral galaxy
11. A sunflower head
12. A pineapple
13. A fingerprint
14. A woven tapestry
15. A chain-link fence
16. A honeycomb
17. A spiderweb
18. A fractal image generated by a computer
19. The veins on a leaf
20. A lightning strike
21. A cracked piece of glass
22. A city skyline
23. A pile of sand
24. A human brain

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
