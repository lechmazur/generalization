Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic techniques or technologies that transform a medium to create a sense of movement or fluidity

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. stop-motion animation
2. kinetic typography
3. time-lapse photography
4. motion blur effects

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. dance choreography
6. wind chimes
7. pendulum
8. bicycle wheel
9. flowing river
10. waterfall
11. spinning top
12. carousel
13. moving walkway
14. escalator
15. revolving door
16. metronome
17. ferris wheel
18. swimming fish
19. falling leaves
20. rolling waves
21. swinging hammock
22. rotating fan
23. moving clouds
24. rocking chair

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
