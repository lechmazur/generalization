Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ritualized combat practices where the primary goal was capturing rather than killing opponents

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Aztec Flower Wars
2. Capture the Flag
3. Medieval Tournament Jousting (with capture rules)
4. Samurai Capture Duels

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Roman Gladiator Fights
6. Boxing Matches
7. Sumo Wrestling
8. Medieval Sword Duels
9. Viking Holmgang
10. Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)
11. Ancient Greek Pankration
12. Fencing Competitions
13. Wrestling Tournaments
14. Judo Competitions
15. Karate Sparring
16. Taekwondo Matches
17. Muay Thai Fights
18. Kickboxing Bouts
19. Medieval Siege Warfare
20. Samurai Sword Fights
21. Archery Contests
22. Paintball Games
23. Airsoft Battles
24. Historical Reenactments

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
