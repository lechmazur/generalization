Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Everyday carry items that have a blade concealed within a handle

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Swiss Army knife
2. Pocket knife
3. Butterfly knife
4. Folding utility knife

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Fixed blade knife
6. Chef's knife
7. Letter opener
8. Scissors
9. Box cutter
10. Multi-tool without a blade
11. Keychain flashlight
12. Ballpoint pen
13. Smartphone
14. Wallet
15. Watch
16. Notebook
17. Flash drive
18. Carabiner
19. Compass
20. Whistle
21. Handkerchief
22. Portable charger
23. Keychain bottle opener
24. Eyeglasses

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
