Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Companies founded in the 1990s that revolutionized their respective industries through innovative use of technology

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Amazon
2. Google
3. eBay
4. Netflix

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Apple
6. Microsoft
7. Facebook
8. Tesla
9. Uber
10. Airbnb
11. Twitter
12. Instagram
13. Spotify
14. LinkedIn
15. Snapchat
16. Pinterest
17. Dropbox
18. Slack
19. Zoom
20. SpaceX
21. Palantir
22. Square
23. Stripe
24. Robinhood

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
