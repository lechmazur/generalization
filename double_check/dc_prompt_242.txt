Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in spiritual practices that produce visible vapor or smoke

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. thurible
2. smudge stick
3. copal burner
4. ketoret bowl

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. prayer beads
6. meditation cushion
7. singing bowl
8. altar cloth
9. holy water
10. prayer flags
11. ritual dagger
12. sacred candle
13. offering plate
14. ceremonial drum
15. ritual bell
16. prayer wheel
17. ritual staff
18. sacred oils
19. crystal ball
20. divination cards
21. ritual wand
22. ceremonial mask
23. ritual chalice
24. sacred scrolls

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
