Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Transportation systems that utilize autonomous navigation technology for non-passenger vehicles

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. autonomous delivery drones for packages
2. self-driving agricultural tractors for crop management
3. robotic warehouse forklifts for inventory transport
4. autonomous cargo ships for maritime logistics

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a passenger self-driving car
6. a human-operated delivery truck
7. a manually piloted airplane
8. a traditional subway train with a driver
9. a bicycle with GPS navigation
10. a remote-controlled toy car
11. a manually steered boat
12. a human-driven taxi
13. a manually operated forklift
14. a drone controlled by a human pilot
15. a traditional train with a conductor
16. a manually driven tractor
17. a human-operated cargo ship
18. a manually guided warehouse robot
19. a passenger bus with a human driver
20. a manually piloted helicopter
21. a human-driven garbage truck
22. a manually operated snowplow
23. a traditional ferry with a captain
24. a human-controlled delivery robot

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
