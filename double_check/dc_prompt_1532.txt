Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Competitive events where participants must hit multiple stationary targets while in motion or under time pressure

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. archery competitions with moving targets
2. skeet shooting events
3. laser tag tournaments with timed target challenges
4. biathlon races combining skiing and rifle shooting

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a marathon race
6. a chess tournament
7. a swimming relay
8. a basketball free-throw contest
9. a rock-climbing competition
10. a figure skating routine
11. a gymnastics floor exercise
12. a weightlifting championship
13. a soccer penalty shootout
14. a tennis match
15. a golf tournament
16. a cycling time trial
17. a rowing regatta
18. a fencing duel
19. a boxing match
20. a volleyball game
21. a baseball home run derby
22. a triathlon event
23. a diving competition
24. a cricket match

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
