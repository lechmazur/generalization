Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): biological phenomena that involve electrical charge differences across cellular membranes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. muscle contraction
2. neurotransmitter release
3. photoreceptor activation in the retina
4. cardiac rhythm generation

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. static electricity on a balloon
6. lightning strike
7. battery charging
8. electric eel discharge
9. DNA replication
10. protein synthesis
11. cellular respiration
12. photosynthesis
13. capacitor function
14. electromagnetic induction
15. osmosis
16. active transport
17. mitosis
18. enzyme catalysis
19. blood clotting
20. hormone secretion
21. nerve growth
22. cell division
23. bacterial conjugation
24. wound healing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
