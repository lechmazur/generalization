Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional characters who were named after real people the author personally knew in childhood

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Anne Shirley from "Anne of Green Gables"
2. Tom Sawyer from "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"
3. Winnie-the-Pooh from "Winnie-the-Pooh"
4. Christopher Robin from "Winnie-the-Pooh"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Sherlock Holmes from "Sherlock Holmes"
6. Harry Potter from "Harry Potter"
7. Elizabeth Bennet from "Pride and Prejudice"
8. Atticus Finch from "To Kill a Mockingbird"
9. Huckleberry Finn from "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"
10. Katniss Everdeen from "The Hunger Games"
11. Frodo Baggins from "The Lord of the Rings"
12. Holden Caulfield from "The Catcher in the Rye"
13. Jay Gatsby from "The Great Gatsby"
14. Hermione Granger from "Harry Potter"
15. Dorothy Gale from "The Wizard of Oz"
16. Scout Finch from "To Kill a Mockingbird"
17. Bilbo Baggins from "The Hobbit"
18. Alice from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
19. Jo March from "Little Women"
20. Dracula from "Dracula"
21. Frankenstein's Monster from "Frankenstein"
22. Oliver Twist from "Oliver Twist"
23. Jane Eyre from "Jane Eyre"
24. Pip from "Great Expectations"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
