Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artifacts or phenomena that were discovered or became observable only after a significant technological or methodological advancement in the field of study

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Higgs boson
2. Exoplanets
3. Gravitational waves
4. Neutrinos

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. DNA structure
6. Bacteria
7. Blood cells
8. X-rays
9. Radio waves
10. Electricity
11. Static electricity
12. Magnetism
13. Chemical reactions
14. Cell division
15. Photosynthesis
16. Sound waves
17. Light refraction
18. Gravity
19. Solar wind
20. Atoms
21. Nuclear fission
22. Weather patterns
23. Ocean currents
24. Continental drift

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
