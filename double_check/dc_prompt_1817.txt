Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or processes that involve multiple levels of decision-making or evaluation, each with increasing complexity and consequence.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. College admissions process
2. Military promotion system
3. Software development lifecycle
4. Clinical trial phases

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Traffic light sequence
6. Restaurant reservation system
7. Library classification system
8. Airport security checkpoints
9. Credit score calculation
10. Emergency response protocols
11. Assembly line production
12. Hotel star rating system
13. Recycling sorting process
14. Video game difficulty settings
15. Restaurant kitchen hierarchy
16. Building security clearance
17. Academic grading scale
18. Movie rating system
19. Package delivery tracking
20. Computer boot sequence
21. Tournament bracket system
22. Airline boarding process
23. Car manufacturing steps
24. Weather warning levels

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
