Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographical features or landmarks that have been named after female explorers or pioneers who helped map that region

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Hayes
2. Lake Baikal
3. Marie Byrd Land
4. Mount McKinley

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mount Everest
6. Victoria Falls
7. Amazon River
8. Grand Canyon
9. Mount Kilimanjaro
10. Niagara Falls
11. Rocky Mountains
12. Yellowstone National Park
13. Great Barrier Reef
14. Mount Fuji
15. Angel Falls
16. Serengeti Plains
17. Yosemite Valley
18. Lake Victoria
19. Mount Rushmore
20. Gal√°pagos Islands
21. Dead Sea
22. Mount Etna
23. Patagonia
24. Uluru

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
