Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Symbolic monuments or memorials that incorporate celestial alignments to mark specific dates of tragedy or loss

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Sun Dagger petroglyph at Chaco Canyon, hypothetically marking the summer solstice and potentially linked to ancestral Puebloan mourning rituals.
2. A hypothetical memorial garden where a beam of sunlight illuminates a specific inscription only on the anniversary of a mining disaster, achieved through precise placement of a gnomon.
3. A fictional monument with strategically placed apertures that project starlight onto a central plaque on the date of a historical shipwreck, creating a constellation-like pattern.
4. A conceptual art installation featuring a reflecting pool that aligns with the rising of Sirius, the Dog Star, on the date of a significant historical fire, symbolically linking the event to the star's association with heat and destruction.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial
6. The Oklahoma City National Memorial
7. Stonehenge
8. Newgrange
9. The World Trade Center Memorial
10. Mount Rushmore
11. The Statue of Liberty
12. The Lincoln Memorial
13. The Washington Monument
14. The Eiffel Tower
15. The Taj Mahal
16. The Great Pyramid of Giza
17. A sundial
18. An astronomical clock
19. A cemetery
20. A mausoleum
21. A tombstone
22. A memorial plaque
23. A commemorative statue
24. An eternal flame

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
