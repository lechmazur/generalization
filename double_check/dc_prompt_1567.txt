Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or artificial formations that accumulate material through cyclical movement and maintain a consistent shape despite constant change in their constituent parts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. sand dune
2. ocean wave
3. glacier
4. river delta

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. mountain
6. volcano
7. coral reef
8. tree
9. cloud
10. lake
11. island
12. cave
13. hill
14. geyser
15. iceberg
16. stalactite
17. desert
18. rainforest
19. waterfall
20. cliff
21. plateau
22. fjord
23. canyon
24. archipelago

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
