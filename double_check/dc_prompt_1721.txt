Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures built around natural geological formations that exhibit unique acoustic properties

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Luray Caverns Great Stalacpipe Organ
2. Ringing Rocks Park Pavilion
3. Fingal's Cave Concert Hall
4. Hoover Dam Spillway Amphitheater

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Sydney Opera House
6. Grand Canyon Skywalk
7. Carlsbad Caverns elevator shaft
8. Stone Mountain Park viewing platform
9. Natural Bridge amphitheater
10. Mammoth Cave visitor center
11. Mount Rushmore viewing terrace
12. Giant's Causeway visitor facility
13. Niagara Falls observation deck
14. Red Rocks Amphitheatre
15. Petra Treasury
16. Crazy Horse Memorial
17. Stonehenge visitor path
18. Antelope Canyon stairway
19. Yosemite Tunnel View parking area
20. Meteor Crater observation building
21. Cave of the Winds walkway
22. Yellowstone boardwalks
23. Rock City gardens
24. Longmen Grottoes viewing platform

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
