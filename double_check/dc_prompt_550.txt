Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products originally designed for highly specialized or extreme environments that were later adapted for widespread commercial use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Freeze-dried food
2. GPS navigation
3. Synthetic fleece
4. Memory foam

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Duct tape
6. Velcro
7. Kevlar
8. Cordura fabric
9. The internet
10. Digital photography
11. Microwave ovens
12. LED lighting
13. Solar panels
14. Hybrid vehicles
15. 3D printing
16. Virtual reality headsets
17. Drones
18. Smartphones
19. Antibiotics
20. Vaccines
21. Water purification tablets
22. First aid kits
23. Pocket knives
24. Sunscreen

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
