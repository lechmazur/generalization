Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices that utilize a continuously looping, single-strand flexible material for primary power transmission.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Capstan-powered winch
2. Belt-drive turntable
3. Chain-driven bicycle
4. Band saw

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gearbox
6. Hydraulic press
7. Pneumatic drill
8. Lever
9. Pulley system with multiple ropes
10. Screw jack
11. Internal combustion engine
12. Electric motor
13. Steam engine
14. Wind turbine
15. Water wheel
16. Bow and arrow
17. Slingshot
18. Trebuchet
19. Yo-yo
20. Conveyor belt (carrying items, not transmitting primary power)
21. Rope swing
22. Zip line
23. Clothesline
24. Drawbridge

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
