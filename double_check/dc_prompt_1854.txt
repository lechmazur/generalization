Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Wooden objects used in traditional outdoor cooking methods across different cultures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Brazilian churrasco skewers
2. Japanese hand-carved cedar grilling planks
3. Filipino lechon bamboo spit
4. Samoan umu wooden tongs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hibachi grill
6. Cast iron skillet
7. Clay oven
8. Metal skewers
9. Whisk
10. Cutting board
11. Rolling pin
12. Wooden spoon
13. Mortar and pestle
14. Charcoal
15. Propane tank
16. Dutch oven
17. Aluminum foil
18. Parchment paper
19. Campfire
20. Gas grill
21. Smoker
22. Pizza stone
23. Tandoor oven
24. Wooden salad bowl

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
