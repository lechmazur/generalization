Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures designed primarily to enhance the acoustic properties of a space for a specific musical instrument or vocal range.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The interior design of the Elbphilharmonie concert hall in Hamburg, Germany, optimized for orchestral music.
2. The construction of the Sydney Opera House, with its unique acoustic considerations for operatic performances.
3. The specific architecture of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, tailored for symphonic music.
4. The design of the Palau de la MÃºsica Catalana in Barcelona, Spain, engineered to enhance choral singing.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A building designed to maximize natural light.
6. A structure built to withstand earthquakes.
7. A skyscraper with a focus on energy efficiency.
8. A sports stadium designed for optimal viewing angles.
9. A bridge engineered for high traffic flow.
10. A library designed to maximize storage space for books.
11. A museum built to protect artworks from environmental damage.
12. A theater designed for large-scale visual productions.
13. A shopping mall with a focus on pedestrian flow.
14. A residential building designed for thermal insulation.
15. A school building optimized for classroom acoustics in general.
16. A hospital designed to minimize the spread of infections.
17. A factory built to optimize production line efficiency.
18. A greenhouse designed to control plant growth conditions.
19. A parking garage designed for maximum vehicle capacity.
20. A church designed to accommodate large congregations.
21. A restaurant designed to enhance the dining experience.
22. A hotel designed for guest comfort and convenience.
23. A government building designed for security and accessibility.
24. A train station designed for efficient passenger flow.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
