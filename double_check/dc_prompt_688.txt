Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that are characterized by a sudden, irreversible transformation triggered by an external force

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a glass shattering upon impact
2. a popcorn kernel popping when heated
3. a balloon bursting from overinflation
4. a match igniting when struck

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a melting ice cube
6. a rusting nail
7. a growing plant
8. a boiling pot of water
9. a fading photograph
10. a cracking egg
11. a bending paperclip
12. a stretching rubber band
13. a dissolving sugar cube
14. a freezing lake
15. a burning candle
16. a collapsing sandcastle
17. a wilting flower
18. a drying paint
19. a spinning top
20. a bouncing ball
21. a rolling wheel
22. a swinging pendulum
23. a vibrating guitar string
24. a dripping faucet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
