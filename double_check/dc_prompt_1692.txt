Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or documents that contain detailed technical instructions for navigating through three-dimensional space

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a flight manual for a drone
2. a spacecraft navigation guide
3. a submarine sonar operation manual
4. a virtual reality headset user guide

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a map of a city
6. a recipe book
7. a car owner's manual
8. a hiking trail guide
9. a GPS device
10. a compass
11. a blueprint for a building
12. a train schedule
13. a weather forecast chart
14. a telescope instruction manual
15. a bicycle assembly guide
16. a video game controller manual
17. a fitness tracker user guide
18. a sewing pattern
19. a smartphone user manual
20. a camera lens guide
21. a musical instrument tuning guide
22. a gardening tool manual
23. a first aid kit instruction sheet
24. a board game rulebook

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
