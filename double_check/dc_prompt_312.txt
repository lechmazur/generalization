Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products discontinued by their manufacturer due to containing a carcinogenic ingredient later discovered by scientific studies.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Certain hair dyes containing aromatic amines
2. Specific types of talcum powder contaminated with asbestos
3. Some brands of sunscreen containing benzene
4. Certain artificial sweeteners found to cause cancer in lab animals

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Leaded gasoline
6. Toys with lead paint
7. Asbestos insulation
8. Cigarettes
9. Processed meats with high nitrate levels
10. Tanning beds
11. Radon gas
12. Certain pesticides
13. Air pollution
14. Genetically modified foods (controversial, not definitively linked)
15. Products recalled for choking hazards
16. Faulty electrical appliances
17. Medications with severe side effects
18. Contaminated food products (e.g., salmonella)
19. Products discontinued due to low sales
20. Products with design flaws
21. Obsolete technology (e.g., VHS tapes)
22. Products replaced by newer versions
23. Certain types of plastic containing BPA
24. Foods with high trans fat content

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
