Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Silent film comedians who founded their own production companies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Charlie Chaplin
2. Buster Keaton
3. Harold Lloyd
4. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Laurel and Hardy
6. Harry Langdon
7. Stan Laurel
8. Oliver Hardy
9. Ben Turpin
10. Mabel Normand
11. Charlie Chase
12. Max Linder
13. Edna Purviance
14. Mary Pickford
15. Douglas Fairbanks
16. Rudolph Valentino
17. Gloria Swanson
18. Clara Bow
19. Lon Chaney
20. John Barrymore
21. Greta Garbo
22. Joan Crawford
23. Norma Talmadge
24. Constance Talmadge

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
