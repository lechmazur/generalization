Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or platforms that integrate multiple data streams to optimize urban environments while maintaining a balance between technological advancement and natural ecosystems.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a smart city platform that uses IoT sensors to monitor air quality, traffic flow, and energy consumption while incorporating green spaces and wildlife corridors
2. an urban farming system that integrates weather data, soil sensors, and automated irrigation to optimize crop yields while preserving local biodiversity
3. a coastal city management system that combines tidal data, pollution sensors, and urban planning tools to mitigate flooding risks while protecting marine ecosystems
4. a public transportation network that uses real-time passenger data, traffic patterns, and energy usage analytics to reduce emissions and promote sustainable commuting options

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a standalone air quality monitor
6. a traffic light system without data integration
7. a wildlife conservation app
8. a solar-powered streetlight
9. a weather forecasting app
10. a smart thermostat for homes
11. a single-stream recycling bin
12. a GPS navigation system
13. a water purification plant
14. a drone for aerial photography
15. a fitness tracker
16. a smartwatch
17. a home security system
18. a standalone energy meter
19. a noise pollution sensor
20. a bicycle-sharing app
21. a flood warning siren
22. a soil moisture sensor
23. a wind turbine
24. a smart irrigation system for gardens

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
