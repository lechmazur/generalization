Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Widely reported events from 2012-2013 that sparked multiple conflicting conspiracy theories within their first month

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting
2. The Boston Marathon bombing
3. The Benghazi attack
4. The death of Hugo Ch√°vez

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The 2012 London Olympics
6. The re-election of Barack Obama
7. The launch of the Curiosity rover on Mars
8. The discovery of the Higgs boson
9. The resignation of Pope Benedict XVI
10. The 2013 papal conclave
11. The legalization of same-sex marriage in several US states
12. The 2013 government shutdown in the United States
13. The release of the PlayStation 4
14. The 2013 horse meat scandal in Europe
15. The election of Xi Jinping as President of China
16. The 2013 meteor explosion over Chelyabinsk, Russia
17. The 2012 end of the world predictions
18. The 2013 Edward Snowden NSA leaks
19. The 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh
20. The 2013 Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines
21. The 2012 Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster
22. The 2013 birth of Prince George
23. The 2013 death of Nelson Mandela
24. The 2012 Gangnam Style viral phenomenon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
