Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative items made from naturally shed animal materials that were historically used as currency in at least one culture

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cowrie shells
2. Quetzal feathers
3. Elk teeth
4. Wampum shells

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ivory tusks
6. Pearl necklaces
7. Coral beads
8. Tortoise shell combs
9. Deer antler buttons
10. Bone dice
11. Silver coins
12. Gold nuggets
13. Amber pendants
14. Jade figurines
15. Leather pouches
16. Fur pelts
17. Carved coconut shells
18. Wooden beads
19. Stone arrowheads
20. Glass trade beads
21. Bronze rings
22. Copper plates
23. Obsidian mirrors
24. Clay tokens

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
