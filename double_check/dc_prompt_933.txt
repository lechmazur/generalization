Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional practices that involve the communal management and redistribution of livestock resources in indigenous African societies.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. communal cattle herding among the Maasai
2. livestock redistribution during droughts among the Himba
3. shared grazing lands managed by the Fulani
4. collective ownership of goats in the Nuer society

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a farmer selling crops at a market
6. a family-owned dairy farm
7. a commercial cattle ranch
8. a private sheep herding business
9. a government-run agricultural subsidy program
10. a cooperative farming initiative
11. a livestock auction
12. a modern feedlot operation
13. a veterinary clinic for pets
14. a hunting expedition for wild game
15. a fishing community sharing catch
16. a beekeeping cooperative
17. a community garden project
18. a wildlife conservation program
19. a private horse breeding stable
20. a pet adoption center
21. a livestock insurance scheme
22. a modern poultry farm
23. a cattle feed production company
24. a rodeo event

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
