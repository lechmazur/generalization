Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects with circular shapes used in traditional transportation methods

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A ship's wheel
2. A penny-farthing bicycle wheel
3. A steam locomotive's driving wheel
4. A stagecoach wheel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A hot air balloon
6. A horse's horseshoe
7. A train whistle
8. A ship's porthole
9. A car tire
10. A bicycle handlebar grip
11. A subway tunnel
12. A plane's propeller
13. A zeppelin
14. A canoe paddle
15. A horse-drawn carriage lamp
16. A train track
17. A steamboat's smokestack
18. A sailing ship's mast
19. A covered wagon's canvas top
20. A rickshaw
21. A dog sled
22. A canal lock
23. A tugboat
24. A barge

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
