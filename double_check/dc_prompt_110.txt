Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials or concepts that combine lightweight properties with high tensile strength or structural resilience, often used in specialized applications requiring durability and efficiency.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Carbon fiber reinforced polymers used in aerospace components
2. Aramid fibers utilized in bulletproof vests
3. Titanium alloys in high-performance bicycle frames
4. Basalt fiber composites in the construction of bridges

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stainless steel used in kitchen appliances
6. Aluminum in beverage cans
7. Polyethylene in plastic bags
8. Concrete in building foundations
9. Glass in windows
10. Copper wiring in electrical systems
11. Rubber in car tires
12. Wood in furniture
13. Leather in shoes
14. Ceramic tiles in bathrooms
15. Paper in books
16. Silicone in cooking utensils
17. Nylon in clothing
18. Polyester in fabric
19. Acrylic in paint
20. Polyurethane in foam mattresses
21. Brass in musical instruments
22. Lead in batteries
23. Gold in jewelry
24. Silver in cutlery

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
