Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Depictions of volcanic activity in charcoal or graphite drawings created by artists born before 1900.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A charcoal sketch of Mount Vesuvius erupting, created by an Italian artist in 1880.
2. A graphite drawing of a volcanic landscape with lava flows, made by a French artist in 1875.
3. A detailed charcoal rendering of a volcanic crater emitting smoke, produced by a German artist in 1890.
4. A graphite study of a volcanic eruption at night, drawn by a British artist in 1865.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a watercolor painting of a serene mountain landscape
6. an oil painting of a volcanic eruption by a modern artist
7. a photograph of an active volcano
8. a digital illustration of a volcanic island
9. a sculpture of a volcano made from clay
10. a pen-and-ink drawing of a forest fire
11. a pastel drawing of a sunset over a mountain
12. a charcoal sketch of a cityscape
13. a graphite drawing of a river flowing through a valley
14. a painting of a volcanic eruption by an artist born in 1905
15. a charcoal drawing of a stormy sea
16. a graphite sketch of a desert landscape
17. a painting of a volcanic eruption in acrylics
18. a charcoal drawing of a medieval castle
19. a graphite study of a rocky coastline
20. a painting of a volcanic eruption in gouache
21. a charcoal drawing of a forest with no volcanic elements
22. a graphite sketch of a mountain range without volcanic activity
23. a painting of a volcanic eruption in watercolors
24. a charcoal drawing of a city skyline with no volcanic features

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
