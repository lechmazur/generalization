Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places or structures that were artificially created to connect two major bodies of water and significantly altered global trade routes before 1900

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Erie Canal
2. Suez Canal
3. Grand Canal of China
4. Bridgewater Canal

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Panama Canal
6. Brooklyn Bridge
7. Strait of Gibraltar
8. Bosphorus Strait
9. Golden Gate Bridge
10. Corinth Canal
11. Transcontinental Railroad
12. Silk Road
13. Roman Aqueducts
14. Chunnel
15. Hoover Dam
16. Cape of Good Hope
17. Isthmus of Panama
18. Khyber Pass
19. Bering Land Bridge
20. St. Lawrence Seaway
21. Kiel Canal
22. Welland Canal
23. Malacca Strait
24. Volga-Don Canal

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
