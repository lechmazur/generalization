Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Restaurants or dining establishments that require transportation by air to access their main entrance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ithaa Undersea Restaurant
2. The Rock Restaurant Zanzibar
3. 360 Degrees Restaurant at The View at The Palm
4. Dinner in the Sky

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a food truck
6. a rooftop caf√©
7. a drive-thru restaurant
8. a beachside bistro
9. a food court stall
10. a pop-up dining event
11. a farm-to-table restaurant
12. a Michelin-starred eatery
13. a food festival
14. a food delivery service
15. a food market
16. a food tasting tour
17. a food-themed museum
18. a food blog
19. a food critic
20. a food photography studio
21. a food packaging company
22. a food science lab
23. a food storage facility
24. a food waste management service

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
