Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to conceal information or items that were commercially available before 1960.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A hollowed-out book
2. A clock with a hidden compartment
3. A tie pin with a microfilm storage
4. A hairbrush with a concealed cavity

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A digital audio recorder
6. A locked diary
7. A password-protected computer
8. A safety deposit box
9. Encrypted software
10. A hidden room in a house
11. Invisible ink
12. A coded message
13. A buried treasure chest
14. A hollowed-out tree
15. Camouflage clothing
16. A magician's trick box
17. A false bottom suitcase (post-1960 design)
18. A hollowed-out cane with a sword inside
19. A secret compartment in a car (modern design)
20. A high-tech spy gadget
21. A hollowed-out lipstick tube (modern design)
22. A ring with a hidden poison compartment (antique, but not for information/items)
23. A child's secret hiding spot under a floorboard
24. A wall safe

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
