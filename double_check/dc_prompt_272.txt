Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): devices used for detecting specific types of anomalies in physical environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Geiger counter
2. Seismograph
3. Thermal imaging camera
4. Metal detector

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphone
6. Television
7. Refrigerator
8. Microwave oven
9. Electric fan
10. Washing machine
11. Air conditioner
12. Vacuum cleaner
13. Blender
14. Toaster
15. Hair dryer
16. Dishwasher
17. Electric kettle
18. Radio
19. Printer
20. Laptop
21. Tablet
22. Smartwatch
23. Electric toothbrush
24. Gaming console

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
