Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): vehicular lighting components designed for specific weather conditions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. fog lights
2. rain-sensing headlights
3. adaptive headlights
4. rear fog lights

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. turn signals
6. brake lights
7. daytime running lights
8. license plate lights
9. interior dome lights
10. reverse lights
11. side marker lights
12. hazard lights
13. headlight washers
14. taillights
15. cornering lights
16. high beam headlights
17. LED accent lights
18. neon underglow lights
19. dashboard lights
20. puddle lights
21. trunk lights
22. glove box lights
23. ambient lighting
24. projector headlights

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
