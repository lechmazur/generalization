Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mythological creatures that were created through a parent figure consuming or drinking something unusual

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. MƒÅui, born after his mother drank from a calabash
2. Fionn mac Cumhaill, conceived after his mother drank a potion
3. Huitzilopochtli, born after his mother consumed a ball of feathers
4. Minos, born after his mother consumed a potion

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Medusa, transformed by Athena
6. Pegasus, born from Medusa's blood
7. Fenrir, offspring of Loki and Angrboda
8. Chimera, offspring of Typhon and Echidna
9. Hydra, offspring of Typhon and Echidna
10. Kraken, a legendary sea monster
11. Griffin, a creature with the body of a lion and the head of an eagle
12. Unicorn, a horse-like creature with a single horn
13. Dragon, a large, serpentine creature
14. Mermaid, a creature with the upper body of a human and the tail of a fish
15. Centaur, a creature with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a horse
16. Gorgon, a creature with snakes for hair
17. Yeti, a mythical ape-like creature
18. Bigfoot, a large, hairy humanoid creature
19. Werewolf, a human who can transform into a wolf
20. Vampire, a creature that drinks blood
21. Zombie, a reanimated corpse
22. Elf, a supernatural being with magical powers
23. Fairy, a small, magical creature
24. Goblin, a mischievous creature

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
