Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural rock formations that create the illusion of a manufactured structure or architectural element when viewed from a distance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a rock formation resembling a castle turret
2. a cliff face that looks like a giant staircase
3. a natural arch that appears to be a bridge
4. a stone pillar that mimics a carved statue

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a sand dune shaped by wind
6. a stalactite in a cave
7. a glacier with crevasses
8. a volcanic crater
9. a coral reef formation
10. a canyon with layered rock
11. a geyser erupting
12. a waterfall cascading over rocks
13. a boulder field
14. a limestone cave with stalagmites
15. a mountain peak
16. a river delta
17. a lava flow
18. a sinkhole
19. a fjord
20. a sea stack
21. a hot spring
22. a mud volcano
23. a rock pool
24. a desert butte

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
