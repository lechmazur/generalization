Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that symbolize transition or change through physical deterioration or disassembly

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A crumbling ancient statue
2. A decaying log slowly returning to the earth
3. A disassembled grandfather clock, its gears and springs laid out on a table
4. A worn-out pair of shoes with holes in the soles and frayed laces

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A butterfly emerging from a chrysalis
6. A seed growing into a plant
7. A tadpole transforming into a frog
8. A caterpillar spinning a cocoon
9. A snake shedding its skin
10. A river flowing to the sea
11. The changing seasons
12. A sunrise
13. A sunset
14. The phases of the moon
15. A building under construction
16. A freshly baked loaf of bread
17. A blooming flower
18. A clean, new car
19. A polished gemstone
20. A stack of neatly folded laundry
21. A full bookshelf
22. A burning candle
23. An hourglass
24. A melting ice cube

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
