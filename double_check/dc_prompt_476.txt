Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geometric shapes that can be constructed by truncating all vertices of a regular convex polychoron such that the original edges are reduced to points.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. rectified 5-cell
2. rectified tesseract
3. rectified 16-cell
4. rectified 24-cell

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. truncated cube
6. truncated dodecahedron
7. truncated icosahedron
8. great rhombicuboctahedron
9. snub cube
10. truncated octahedron
11. cantellated 120-cell
12. runcinated 600-cell
13. bitruncated 24-cell
14. omnitruncated 5-cell
15. regular octahedron
16. regular icosahedron
17. rhombic dodecahedron
18. truncated square pyramid
19. pentagonal prism
20. hexagonal bipyramid
21. truncated tetrahedron
22. cuboctahedron
23. icosidodecahedron
24. rhombicosidodecahedron

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
