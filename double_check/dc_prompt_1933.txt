Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Shipping containers designed specifically for the transport of cultural artifacts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A climate-controlled crate for transporting ancient manuscripts
2. A shock-absorbent container for moving delicate sculptures
3. A humidity-regulated box for shipping historical paintings
4. A vibration-dampening case for transporting archaeological artifacts

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a refrigerated container for perishable food
6. a standard shipping container for electronics
7. a padded box for fragile glassware
8. a waterproof container for outdoor gear
9. a temperature-controlled unit for pharmaceuticals
10. a reinforced crate for heavy machinery
11. a fireproof safe for important documents
12. a sealed container for hazardous materials
13. a lightweight box for express mail
14. a stackable bin for warehouse storage
15. a collapsible container for space-saving storage
16. a vacuum-sealed bag for clothing
17. a foam-lined case for musical instruments
18. a GPS-tracked container for high-value goods
19. a biodegradable package for eco-friendly shipping
20. a tamper-evident box for secure deliveries
21. a modular container for flexible shipping solutions
22. a palletized box for bulk items
23. a UV-protected case for sensitive electronics
24. a custom-fit box for automotive parts

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
