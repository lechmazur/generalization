Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that were initially developed for practical or utilitarian purposes but later became associated with luxury, status, or artistic expression.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mechanical watches
2. Persian rugs
3. The katana (samurai sword)
4. Falconry

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smartphone
6. A sports car
7. A designer handbag
8. A private jet
9. High-heeled shoes
10. A diamond necklace
11. A luxury yacht
12. A grand piano
13. A telescope
14. A fountain pen
15. A vintage car
16. A painting
17. A sculpture
18. A piece of antique furniture
19. A rare stamp
20. A first edition book
21. A bottle of fine wine
22. A gourmet meal
23. A bespoke suit
24. A piece of jewelry

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
