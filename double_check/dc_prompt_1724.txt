Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for manipulation to create visual representations or effects

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A tube of oil paint
2. A set of colored pencils
3. A lump of clay
4. A piece of charcoal

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A canvas
6. An easel
7. A paintbrush
8. A palette knife
9. A pottery wheel
10. A kiln
11. A camera
12. A computer monitor
13. A graphics tablet
14. A microphone
15. A musical instrument
16. A stage prop
17. A costume
18. A theatrical mask
19. A book
20. A pen
21. A pencil
22. A piece of paper
23. A typewriter
24. A computer keyboard

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
