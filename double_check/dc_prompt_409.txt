Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human hands that incorporate a spiral structure to achieve their primary function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. corkscrew
2. manual pencil sharpener
3. hand drill
4. manual meat grinder

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. spiral staircase
6. DNA double helix
7. spiral notebook
8. curly telephone cord
9. slinky toy
10. spiral pasta
11. nautilus shell
12. spiral galaxy
13. coiled garden hose
14. spiral binding
15. tornado
16. ram's horns
17. spiral jetty
18. fibonacci spiral
19. spiral fractal
20. chambered nautilus
21. spiral seashell
22. coiled rope
23. spring coil
24. spiral slide

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
