Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that pause mid-action due to mechanical failure, creating an unintentional frozen moment that captures the incompleteness of their intended function

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A drawbridge stuck halfway open due to a snapped cable, leaving a car stranded precariously on the rising section.
2. A robot arm on an assembly line frozen mid-weld, its torch still sparking against the unfinished chassis.
3. A revolving door jammed between rotations, trapping a person awkwardly between the glass panels.
4. A vintage typewriter with its keys tangled and ribbon snapped, preserving the last typed word incomplete.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A paused video game
6. A statue of a discus thrower
7. A car parked in a driveway
8. A sleeping cat
9. A painting depicting a battle scene
10. A light switch in the off position
11. A book placed open on a table
12. A frozen meal
13. A person holding their breath underwater
14. A computer in sleep mode
15. A record player stopped mid-song
16. A construction site at the end of the workday
17. A theater curtain closed between acts
18. A traffic light stuck on red
19. A photograph of a hummingbird in flight
20. A watch with a dead battery
21. A flag at half-mast
22. A power outage interrupting a movie
23. A broken pencil
24. A deflated balloon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
