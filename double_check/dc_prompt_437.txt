Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for human use that incorporate a primary cylindrical component visibly segmented into three distinct sections of roughly equal length.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A three-stage collapsible baton
2. A traffic light with three equally sized stacked lenses
3. A three-tiered spice rack with cylindrical containers
4. A segmented rolling pin with three textured sections

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A barber pole
6. A lipstick tube
7. A telescope
8. A marker pen
9. A tiered cake
10. A stack of coins
11. A roll of paper towels
12. A spool of thread
13. A bottle of wine
14. A can of soda
15. A flashlight
16. A cigarette
17. A pencil
18. A drinking straw
19. A pipe wrench
20. A dumbbell
21. A rolling pin
22. A spring
23. A bolt
24. A candle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
