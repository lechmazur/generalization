Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Books where the protagonist is a detective with a unique psychological condition that aids in solving mysteries

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time
2. The Alienist
3. Dexter
4. The Mentalist

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Sherlock Holmes
6. Miss Marple
7. Hercule Poirot
8. Nancy Drew
9. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
10. Gone Girl
11. The Da Vinci Code
12. Big Little Lies
13. The Silence of the Lambs
14. In the Woods
15. The Big Sleep
16. The Maltese Falcon
17. The Secret History
18. Sharp Objects
19. The Reversal
20. The Lincoln Lawyer
21. The Cuckoo's Calling
22. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency
23. The Postman Always Rings Twice
24. The Name of the Rose

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
