Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Surveillance or monitoring systems that were originally designed for one purpose but became widely adopted for tracking dance movements or choreography

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Motion capture technology used in film production studios being repurposed for dance performance analysis
2. GPS tracking devices initially developed for wildlife research being used to map out dance choreography patterns
3. Security cameras installed in public spaces being utilized by dance enthusiasts to record and study street dance moves
4. Accelerometers in smartphones, originally designed for fitness tracking, being employed to analyze and replicate dance steps

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Traffic cameras used for monitoring road conditions
6. Heart rate monitors used in medical settings
7. Surveillance drones used for border patrol
8. RFID tags used for inventory management in retail
9. Weather satellites used for meteorological data collection
10. Seismographs used for detecting earthquakes
11. Barcode scanners used in supermarkets
12. Facial recognition software used for security at airports
13. Web analytics tools used for tracking website visitor behavior
14. Electronic ankle bracelets used for monitoring parolees
15. Thermal imaging cameras used for detecting heat loss in buildings
16. Speed cameras used for enforcing traffic laws
17. Biometric scanners used for employee time tracking
18. License plate readers used for parking enforcement
19. Underwater sonar used for mapping ocean floors
20. Telemetry systems used in space exploration
21. Video conferencing software used for remote meetings
22. Smart home devices used for controlling household appliances
23. Electronic toll collection systems used on highways
24. Noise monitoring devices used for assessing environmental sound levels

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
