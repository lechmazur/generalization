Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): inventions from the 1950s that revolutionized food service

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The introduction of the first commercial microwave oven by Raytheon in 1954.
2. The launch of the first automatic drip coffee maker by Mr. Coffee in 1952.
3. The invention of the first electric non-stick frying pan by Tefal in 1954.
4. The debut of the first commercial blender by Waring in 1950.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the refrigerator in the early 20th century.
6. The development of the first fast food restaurant chain in the 1920s.
7. The creation of the first vending machine in the late 19th century.
8. The introduction of the first dishwasher in the late 19th century.
9. The invention of the first gas stove in the late 19th century.
10. The development of the first electric mixer in the early 20th century.
11. The creation of the first food processor in the 1970s.
12. The introduction of the first convection oven in the 1960s.
13. The invention of the first sous-vide machine in the 1970s.
14. The development of the first commercial deep fryer in the 1930s.
15. The creation of the first electric grill in the 1960s.
16. The introduction of the first instant pot in the 2010s.
17. The invention of the first commercial ice cream maker in the 19th century.
18. The development of the first commercial juicer in the 1930s.
19. The creation of the first electric kettle in the early 20th century.
20. The introduction of the first commercial toaster in the early 20th century.
21. The invention of the first commercial pressure cooker in the 1930s.
22. The development of the first commercial slow cooker in the 1970s.
23. The creation of the first commercial bread slicer in the 1920s.
24. The introduction of the first commercial pasta maker in the 20th century.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
