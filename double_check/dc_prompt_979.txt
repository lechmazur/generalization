Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts historically associated with the manipulation or perception of supernatural phenomena through reflective surfaces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. crystal ball
2. black mirror
3. scrying bowl
4. obsidian disk

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. tarot cards
6. ouija board
7. pendulum
8. runes
9. telescope
10. microscope
11. kaleidoscope
12. prism
13. magnifying glass
14. window
15. crystal pendant
16. dreamcatcher
17. magic wand
18. crystal pyramid
19. candle
20. incense burner
21. crystal cluster
22. amulet
23. talisman
24. crystal skull

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
