Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures used for ceremonial purposes located in secluded or hard-to-reach areas

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A cliffside altar used for solstice celebrations
2. A hidden forest grove dedicated to ancestral spirit rituals
3. A remote mountaintop shrine for vision quests
4. A desert cave adorned with ancient petroglyphs and used for sacred ceremonies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A church in a bustling city center
6. A roadside memorial
7. A stadium used for sporting events
8. A community center hosting various activities
9. An online forum for religious discussion
10. A private chapel in a family home
11. A graveyard in a populated area
12. A monument commemorating a historical event
13. A museum exhibiting religious artifacts
14. A classroom used for religious instruction
15. A monastery located in a suburban area
16. A synagogue in a residential neighborhood
17. A mosque in a city's cultural district
18. A temple complex in a tourist destination
19. A meditation room in a wellness center
20. A Stonehenge replica in a public park
21. An ancient Roman amphitheater
22. A concert hall used for orchestral performances
23. A university's philosophy department building
24. A public library containing religious texts

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
