Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Stuffed animals or plush toys that have been recalled due to containing hidden compartments or dangerous materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a teddy bear with a concealed zipper pocket containing small, sharp objects
2. a plush bunny with a hidden compartment holding hazardous chemicals
3. a stuffed dinosaur with a secret pouch filled with choking hazards
4. a plush owl with a concealed flap containing toxic stuffing material

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a rubber duck
6. a wooden puzzle
7. a plastic action figure
8. a board game
9. a remote-controlled car
10. a coloring book
11. a set of building blocks
12. a toy train
13. a dollhouse
14. a kite
15. a jump rope
16. a hula hoop
17. a yo-yo
18. a frisbee
19. a toy drum
20. a play kitchen set
21. a toy microscope
22. a stuffed animal keychain
23. a toy robot
24. a toy xylophone

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
