Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that enable the study of inaccessible natural environments through indirect observation methods

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Deep-sea remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)
2. Satellite imagery for monitoring deforestation in remote rainforests
3. Radio telemetry for tracking animal migration patterns in inaccessible wilderness areas
4. Ice-penetrating radar for studying subglacial lakes and rivers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Microscopes
6. Telescopes
7. High-speed cameras
8. Underwater diving gear (scuba)
9. Field notebooks for ecological surveys
10. Binoculars for birdwatching
11. Weather balloons
12. Soil sampling probes
13. GPS trackers for individual animals
14. Camera traps for wildlife monitoring
15. Drones for aerial photography
16. Sonar for mapping the ocean floor
17. Seismographs for earthquake detection
18. Laboratory analysis of water samples
19. Electron microscopes for cellular biology
20. Spectrometers for chemical analysis
21. Thermometers for measuring temperature
22. Barometers for measuring atmospheric pressure
23. Hydrophones for underwater sound recording
24. Magnetometers for measuring magnetic fields

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
