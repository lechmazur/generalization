Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that serve as a medium for conveying or manipulating information in a way that is not immediately apparent to the casual observer

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A altered image where metadata has been subtly changed to misrepresent the time or location it was taken.
2. A seemingly innocuous decorative item containing a hidden microphone for surveillance.
3. A digital audio file with embedded steganographic messages.
4. A book cipher where specific words on designated pages are used to create a coded message.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting with a hidden signature.
6. A locked diary.
7. A coded message written in invisible ink.
8. A secret compartment in a desk.
9. A password-protected computer file.
10. A whispered conversation.
11. A hand gesture used in sign language.
12. A smoke signal.
13. A carrier pigeon.
14. A message in a bottle.
15. Morse code transmitted via radio waves.
16. A newspaper advertisement with a hidden message.
17. A song with coded lyrics.
18. A poem with a double meaning.
19. A public sculpture with symbolic elements.
20. A stage magician's illusions.
21. A ventriloquist's dummy.
22. A coded message written in a foreign language.
23. A complex mathematical equation.
24. A scientific research paper.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
