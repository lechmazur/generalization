Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical timekeeping devices that rely on natural cycles or seasonal phenomena rather than gears or pendulums

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A sundial
2. A water clock (clepsydra) based on consistent flow rate
3. An oil lamp clock with marked levels indicating passage of time
4. A candle clock with marked increments

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A grandfather clock
6. A cuckoo clock
7. An hourglass
8. A wristwatch
9. A stopwatch
10. An atomic clock
11. A quartz clock
12. A digital clock
13. A metronome
14. A pendulum
15. Gears
16. A spring
17. A calendar
18. A chronometer
19. A marine chronometer
20. A timer
21. An egg timer
22. A clock tower
23. Big Ben
24. A sundial designed as an ornament but not functional

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
