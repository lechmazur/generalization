Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places where traditional seasonal festivals are held in working agricultural spaces that still actively produce food or materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Oktoberfest in a Bavarian hop farm
2. Cherry Blossom Festival in a Japanese tea plantation
3. Lavender Festival in a French lavender field
4. Harvest Festival in a working vineyard in Tuscany

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. New Year's Eve in Times Square
6. Mardi Gras in New Orleans
7. Diwali in a city square
8. Chinese New Year in a metropolitan Chinatown
9. St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dublin
10. Rio Carnival in Brazil
11. Thanksgiving Parade in New York City
12. Burning Man in the Nevada desert
13. Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland
14. Venice Carnival in Italy
15. Coachella Music Festival in California
16. Glastonbury Festival in England
17. Running of the Bulls in Pamplona
18. Holi Festival in a city park
19. Oktoberfest in a city beer hall
20. Christmas Market in a town square
21. Summer Solstice at Stonehenge
22. Day of the Dead in a Mexican cemetery
23. Lantern Festival in a city center
24. Film Festival in Cannes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
