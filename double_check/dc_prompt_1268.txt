Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that originated in a specific city and later became globally influential or widely recognized, despite their initial obscurity or local significance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Pizza
2. Jazz music
3. Anime
4. Yoga

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Soccer
6. Rock music
7. Tea
8. Baseball
9. Classical music
10. Opera
11. Basketball
12. Rugby
13. Hip hop
14. Cricket
15. Wine
16. Cheese
17. Martial arts
18. Football
19. Poetry
20. Philosophy
21. Painting
22. Drama
23. Literature
24. Dance

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
