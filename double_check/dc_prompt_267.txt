Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects with intricate surface patterns used in medieval religious artifacts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Cloisters Cross
2. The Pala d'Oro
3. The Reliquary of Sainte Foy
4. The Ardagh Chalice

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A medieval tapestry
6. A stained glass window from a cathedral
7. A modern sculpture with intricate patterns
8. An ancient Egyptian artifact with hieroglyphs
9. A piece of Islamic calligraphy
10. A medieval manuscript with illuminated letters
11. A contemporary jewelry piece with detailed engravings
12. A traditional African mask with geometric designs
13. A Native American pottery with painted patterns
14. A Chinese porcelain vase with floral motifs
15. A medieval sword with decorative hilt
16. A Byzantine mosaic
17. A Renaissance painting with intricate details
18. A Celtic knotwork design on a modern item
19. An Aztec calendar stone
20. A medieval castle's decorative stonework
21. A Japanese kimono with embroidered patterns
22. A Roman coin with detailed imagery
23. A Gothic cathedral's architectural ornamentation
24. A Victorian era brooch with filigree work

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
