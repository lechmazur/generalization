Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate a full rotation around a fixed axle and were invented before 1800 CE.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a potter's wheel
2. a water wheel
3. a spinning wheel
4. a windmill

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bicycle
6. a Ferris wheel
7. a gyroscope
8. a steering wheel
9. a gear
10. a propeller
11. a clock hand
12. a fan
13. a drill
14. a carousel
15. a roulette wheel
16. a record player
17. a turbine
18. a merry-go-round
19. a roller skate
20. a yo-yo
21. a pinwheel
22. a compass
23. a pulley
24. a screw

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
