Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional folk dances performed in winter festivals that incorporate percussive footwork as a key rhythmic element

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Zapateado from Spain
2. Clogging from the Appalachian region
3. Irish Stepdance from Ireland
4. Russian Trepak from Russia

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Flamenco from Spain
6. Hula from Hawaii
7. Samba from Brazil
8. Waltz from Austria
9. Polka from Poland
10. Capoeira from Brazil
11. Ballet from France
12. Tango from Argentina
13. Butoh from Japan
14. Breakdancing from the USA
15. Square Dance from the USA
16. Khon from Thailand
17. Odissi from India
18. Fandango from Spain
19. Ghoomar from India
20. Jive from the USA
21. Rumba from Cuba
22. Bollywood Dance from India
23. Highland Dance from Scotland
24. Cha-Cha-Cha from Cuba

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
