Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Amphibians with distinctive skull shapes used in popular culture.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hypnotoad from Futurama
2. Michigan J. Frog from Looney Tunes
3. Kermit the Frog from The Muppets
4. Toad from X-Men

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Tree frog
6. Poison dart frog
7. Bullfrog
8. Fire salamander
9. Axolotl
10. Newt
11. Frogger
12. Crazy Frog
13. Battletoads characters
14. Trevor the Toad from Harry Potter
15. Common toad
16. Japanese giant salamander
17. Spotted salamander
18. African clawed frog
19. Pac-Man frog
20. Cane toad
21. Pepe the Frog
22. Slippy Toad from Star Fox
23. Toad from Super Mario Bros
24. Greninja from Pokemon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
