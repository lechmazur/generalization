Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that enable communication without spoken or written language

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sign language video relay service
2. Emoji-based communication apps
3. Augmented reality gesture recognition systems
4. Braille communication devices

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Video conferencing software
6. Email services
7. Text messaging apps
8. Voice recognition software
9. Telephone systems
10. Social media platforms
11. Instant messaging services
12. Speech-to-text conversion tools
13. Language translation apps
14. Radio communication devices
15. Walkie-talkies
16. Public address systems
17. Telegraph systems
18. Morse code communication
19. Signaling flags used in maritime communication
20. Smoke signals
21. Drum communication used in some cultures
22. Semaphore flag signaling
23. Helicopter hand signals
24. Traffic light systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
