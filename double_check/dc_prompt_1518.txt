Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials or processes that artificially replicate naturally-occurring biological structures while deliberately excluding living cells from the final product

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Synthetic spider silk woven into a fabric
2. A prosthetic heart valve made of biocompatible polymers
3. A lab-grown diamond with the same crystal structure as a naturally occurring diamond
4. A microfluidic device mimicking the branching patterns of a lung's alveoli

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A tissue-engineered blood vessel
6. A bacterial cellulose face mask
7. A cultured meat product
8. A bioluminescent lamp using genetically modified bacteria
9. A bone graft using coral
10. A leather bag
11. A wooden chair
12. A cotton shirt
13. A silk scarf
14. A wool sweater
15. A seashell used as decoration
16. A genetically modified plant
17. A 3D-printed organ scaffold seeded with cells
18. A vaccine
19. A bioreactor
20. A petri dish with growing bacteria
21. A preserved butterfly in a frame
22. A taxidermied animal
23. A fossil
24. A bio-inspired robot

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
