Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems experiencing a perceived standstill due to incremental, imperceptible change relative to the observer's timescale.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a glacier slowly carving a valley over millennia
2. the gradual erosion of a mountain range over millions of years
3. the imperceptible aging of a star over billions of years
4. the slow accumulation of sediment forming a delta over centuries

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a clock ticking in real-time
6. a tree growing visibly over a year
7. a river flooding after heavy rain
8. a car accelerating on a highway
9. a plant wilting overnight
10. a candle burning down during a meal
11. a child growing taller over a summer
12. a city skyline changing over a decade
13. a sandcastle being washed away by waves
14. a glacier calving into the ocean
15. a volcano erupting suddenly
16. a forest fire spreading rapidly
17. a comet streaking across the sky
18. a landslide occurring after heavy rainfall
19. a building collapsing in an earthquake
20. a river freezing overnight in winter
21. a flower blooming in a day
22. a meteorite striking the Earth
23. a dam breaking under pressure
24. a solar eclipse occurring in minutes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
