Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic representations that utilize self-similar, recursive patterns to evoke a sense of organized chaos or controlled complexity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. M.C. Escher's "Circle Limit III"
2. The Sierpinski Triangle
3. Jackson Pollock's "Lavender Mist"
4. Mandelbrot Set visualizations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Van Gogh's "Starry Night"
6. A spider's web
7. DNA double helix model
8. Honeycomb patterns
9. Islamic geometric tiles
10. Celtic knot designs
11. Nautilus shell
12. Snowflake crystals
13. Tree branching patterns
14. Fibonacci spiral
15. Kandinsky's "Composition VIII"
16. Roman mosaic floors
17. Gothic cathedral rose windows
18. Aboriginal dot paintings
19. Persian carpet designs
20. Zen garden patterns
21. Crop circles
22. Sand mandalas
23. Butterfly wing patterns
24. Crystal formations

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
