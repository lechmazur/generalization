Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or practices that involve the symbolic or literal transformation of a core element through a process of fragmentation, dispersal, or ritualistic division.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a jigsaw puzzle
2. a pi√±ata
3. a sand mandala
4. a wishbone

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a chessboard
6. a kaleidoscope
7. a Rubik's cube
8. a mosaic
9. a stained glass window
10. a quilt
11. a patchwork blanket
12. a collage
13. a fractal pattern
14. a constellation
15. a spider web
16. a labyrinth
17. a map
18. a tapestry
19. a mural
20. a crossword puzzle
21. a domino set
22. a beaded necklace
23. a chain link fence
24. a barcode

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
