Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): astronomical phenomena that have inspired recurring motifs in modernist poetry written between 1910-1940

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The moon's phases
2. The aurora borealis
3. Comets
4. Constellations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The ocean's tides
6. The changing seasons
7. The concept of time
8. The symbolism of light and darkness
9. The myth of Icarus
10. The concept of infinity
11. The imagery of flight
12. The symbolism of the sun
13. The metaphor of the journey
14. The theme of isolation
15. The concept of fate
16. The imagery of mirrors
17. The symbolism of water
18. The theme of transformation
19. The concept of the sublime
20. The imagery of storms
21. The symbolism of fire
22. The theme of rebirth
23. The concept of the void
24. The imagery of shadows

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
