Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Documents signed in the 20th century that ended major international conflicts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Treaty of Versailles
2. The Treaty of San Francisco
3. The Dayton Agreement
4. The Good Friday Agreement

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Treaty of Tordesillas
6. The Congress of Vienna
7. The Camp David Accords
8. The Treaty of Westphalia
9. The Oslo Accords
10. The Treaty of Paris (1783)
11. The Treaty of Ghent
12. The Peace of Westphalia
13. The Treaty of Utrecht
14. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
15. The Treaty of Portsmouth
16. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
17. The Kellogg-Briand Pact
18. The Treaty of Trianon
19. The Treaty of SÃ¨vres
20. The Treaty of Lausanne
21. The Treaty of Riga
22. The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye
23. The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine
24. The Treaty of Shimonoseki

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
