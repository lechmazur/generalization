Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or structures that use perforations or openings to regulate flow, visibility, or interaction while maintaining structural integrity

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. colander
2. chain-link fence
3. perforated metal sheet
4. louvered window

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. solid brick wall
6. glass window
7. wooden door
8. concrete barrier
9. solid metal sheet
10. plastic tarp
11. solid rubber tire
12. wooden fence
13. solid ceramic vase
14. solid plastic bucket
15. solid steel beam
16. solid wooden table
17. solid glass bottle
18. solid stone sculpture
19. solid metal pipe
20. solid plastic chair
21. solid wooden crate
22. solid metal box
23. solid concrete block
24. solid rubber mat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
