Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate a flexible, articulated joint allowing for a change in the angle between two rigid components, where the joint's primary function is related to capturing or securing another object.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. handcuffs
2. spring-loaded clothespin
3. lobster claw clasp
4. carabiner

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. door hinge
6. folding chair
7. scissors
8. pliers
9. nutcracker
10. tweezers
11. knee joint
12. elbow brace
13. puppet joint
14. watch band link
15. bike chain
16. folding ladder
17. cabinet hinge
18. window latch
19. paper clip
20. binder clip
21. safety pin
22. bottle cap
23. zip tie
24. rubber band

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
