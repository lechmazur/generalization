Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical cultural practices involving dance and spiritual beliefs among Native American tribes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Iroquois False Face Society's masked dances performed for healing and community well-being.
2. The Hopi Snake Dance, a prayer for rain and the fertility of crops.
3. The Lakota Sun Dance, a ceremony of renewal and sacrifice involving physical endurance.
4. The Tlingit ceremonial dances performed with elaborate masks and regalia representing ancestral spirits and stories.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Rain dances performed by farmers in ancient Egypt.
6. The Ghost Dance movement of the late 19th century.
7. Whirling Dervishes in Sufism.
8. Japanese Noh theatre.
9. Balinese masked dances.
10. The use of peyote in Native American Church ceremonies.
11. Totem poles of the Pacific Northwest.
12. Dreamcatchers in Ojibwe culture.
13. Powwows.
14. The Green Corn Ceremony.
15. Native American flute music.
16. Sand painting in Navajo healing rituals.
17. Storytelling traditions in various Native American cultures.
18. The use of sweat lodges for purification.
19. Vision quests.
20. Traditional Native American games.
21. Native American beadwork and quillwork.
22. The role of the shaman in indigenous cultures.
23. The construction and use of canoes by Native American tribes.
24. Native American pottery and ceramics.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
