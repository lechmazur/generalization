Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations that contain both a predatory animal name and a geological landform in their official place name

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Wolf Mountain, Utah
2. Bear Butte, South Dakota
3. Lion's Head Peak, South Africa
4. Tiger Hill, India

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Eagle, Colorado
6. Rocky Mountains
7. Bear Lake
8. Wolf Creek Pass
9. Grand Canyon
10. Shark Bay
11. Mount Everest
12. Death Valley
13. Fox River
14. Great Plains
15. Cougar Springs
16. Snake River
17. Badlands National Park
18. Lion Country
19. Tiger Woods
20. Hawk Ridge
21. Mammoth Cave
22. Coyote Valley
23. Black Hills
24. Grizzly Peak

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
