Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that have been repurposed for a different primary function than originally intended

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a decommissioned church converted into a bookstore
2. an old railway station transformed into a museum
3. a former factory now serving as a luxury apartment complex
4. a disused water tower repurposed into a boutique hotel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a lighthouse still used for navigation
6. a modern skyscraper designed for office spaces
7. a historic castle preserved as a tourist attraction
8. a shopping mall built from scratch
9. a newly constructed airport terminal
10. a traditional Japanese tea house
11. a contemporary art gallery built as an art gallery
12. a sports stadium used exclusively for sporting events
13. a university library designed for academic use
14. a medieval fortress restored for historical tours
15. a modern hospital built for medical purposes
16. a newly built concert hall for performances
17. a government building used for administrative offices
18. a residential house built as a family home
19. a bridge constructed for transportation
20. a newly designed theater for stage productions
21. a cathedral still used for religious services
22. a modern hotel built as a hotel
23. a public park designed for recreation
24. a newly constructed school building

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
