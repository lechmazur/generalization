Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer electronics released in 1993 that used a physical cartridge-based game format

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) game cartridge
2. Sega Genesis game cartridge
3. Atari Jaguar game cartridge
4. TurboGrafx-16 HuCard

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. PlayStation 1 CD-ROM
6. Nintendo Game Boy Advance cartridge
7. Xbox 360 game disc
8. Nintendo Switch game card
9. Commodore 64 floppy disk
10. Apple II cassette tape
11. Nintendo 64DD disk
12. Sega Dreamcast GD-ROM
13. Wii U game disc
14. GameCube miniDVD
15. Atari 2600 game cartridge
16. Nintendo DS game card
17. PlayStation Portable UMD
18. Virtual Boy game cartridge
19. Neo Geo AES game cartridge
20. Magnavox Odyssey game card
21. ColecoVision game cartridge
22. Intellivision game cartridge
23. Vectrex game cartridge
24. Nintendo 3DS game card

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
