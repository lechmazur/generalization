Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Major engineering projects from 1850-1950 that required the invention of new mathematical or statistical methods to complete

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The construction of the Hoover Dam, which required advancements in concrete strength testing and structural analysis.
2. The development of the Panama Canal, which necessitated new methods for calculating water flow and soil stability.
3. The design of the Golden Gate Bridge, which involved innovations in aerodynamic modeling and suspension cable tension calculations.
4. The Manhattan Project, which required the invention of new statistical methods for nuclear reaction modeling and material analysis.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the steam engine.
6. The construction of the Eiffel Tower.
7. The development of the first commercial airplane.
8. The creation of the first electric power grid.
9. The building of the Transcontinental Railroad.
10. The design of the first skyscrapers.
11. The invention of the telephone.
12. The construction of the London Underground.
13. The development of the first automobiles.
14. The creation of the first radio communication systems.
15. The building of the Sydney Opera House.
16. The invention of the first computers.
17. The construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.
18. The development of the first submarines.
19. The creation of the first radar systems.
20. The building of the Empire State Building.
21. The invention of the first jet engines.
22. The construction of the Channel Tunnel.
23. The development of the first space rockets.
24. The creation of the first nuclear reactors.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
