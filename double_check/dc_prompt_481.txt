Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that were central to the plot of a live-action theatrical film starring Elijah Wood and released between 1990 and 2010.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The One Ring
2. A video cassette tape
3. A pair of glasses
4. A journal

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a magic wand
6. a spaceship
7. a time machine
8. a sword
9. a treasure map
10. a crystal ball
11. a golden ticket
12. a ruby slipper
13. a cursed amulet
14. a flying carpet
15. a secret potion
16. a magic mirror
17. a dragon egg
18. a philosopher's stone
19. a talking animal
20. a haunted doll
21. a superhero suit
22. a genie lamp
23. a pirate ship
24. a mystical book

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
