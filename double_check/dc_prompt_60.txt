Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Literary works featuring a protagonist who experiences a significant internal transformation as a direct result of prolonged isolation in a natural setting.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Walden by Henry David Thoreau
2. Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe
3. My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George
4. Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway
6. Lord of the Flies by William Golding
7. The Road by Cormac McCarthy
8. Life of Pi by Yann Martel
9. The Call of the Wild by Jack London
10. Moby-Dick by Herman Melville
11. The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett
12. Hatchet by Gary Paulsen
13. The Martian by Andy Weir
14. Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens
15. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho
16. The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
17. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling
18. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
19. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
20. 1984 by George Orwell
21. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
22. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
23. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
24. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
