Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): mechanical devices that combine precise engineering with an element of theatrical or ceremonial presentation in their operation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a mechanical clock with moving figurines that perform a dance at each hour
2. a music box with a rotating ballerina that emerges when the lid is opened
3. a kinetic sculpture that uses gears and levers to create a mesmerizing visual display
4. a ceremonial cannon that fires confetti and plays music during celebrations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wind-up toy car
6. a hydraulic press
7. a grandfather clock
8. a steam engine
9. a robotic arm in a factory
10. a pocket watch
11. a bicycle
12. a sewing machine
13. a typewriter
14. a cuckoo clock without figurines
15. a drone
16. a 3D printer
17. a car engine
18. a telescope
19. a wind turbine
20. a roller coaster
21. a conveyor belt
22. a jackhammer
23. a washing machine
24. a calculator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
