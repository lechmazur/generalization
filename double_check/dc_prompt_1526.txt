Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical systems that use spring-loaded sequential feeding mechanisms to automatically advance discrete items one at a time

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a Pez dispenser
2. a stapler with a spring-loaded staple magazine
3. a mechanical pencil with a spring-loaded lead advance
4. a gumball machine with a spring-loaded dispensing mechanism

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a conveyor belt system
6. a vending machine with a rotating coil
7. a manual typewriter
8. a clock with a pendulum
9. a bicycle gear shifter
10. a ballpoint pen
11. a wind-up toy
12. a cuckoo clock
13. a sewing machine
14. a music box
15. a slot machine
16. a photocopier paper tray
17. a rotary dial telephone
18. a fishing reel
19. a toaster
20. a cash register
21. a film camera
22. a grandfather clock
23. a mechanical watch
24. a turntable

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
