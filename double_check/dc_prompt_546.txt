Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures designed to regulate the flow of water featuring a polyhedral basin whose faces are all regular polygons, but not all congruent.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A small fountain basin shaped like a truncated icosahedron.
2. A concrete cistern with the shape of a rhombicuboctahedron.
3. An ornamental bird bath designed as a truncated cube.
4. A large reservoir shaped like a great rhombicosidodecahedron.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A spherical water tank
6. A cylindrical water tower
7. A conical funnel
8. A rectangular swimming pool
9. A square koi pond
10. An irrigation ditch
11. A river delta
12. A dam
13. A levee
14. A canal lock
15. A water wheel
16. A water pump
17. A rain barrel
18. A watering can
19. A garden hose
20. A sprinkler head
21. A fire hydrant
22. A drinking fountain
23. A water bottle
24. An ice cube tray

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
