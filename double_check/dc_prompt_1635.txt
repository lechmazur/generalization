Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional worlds or settings that prominently feature bioluminescent flora as a core part of their ecosystem and visual identity

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Pandora from "Avatar"
2. The world of "Nocturne" in the game "Ori and the Blind Forest"
3. The planet of "Naboo" in the "Star Wars" universe
4. The world of "Zanarkand" in "Final Fantasy X"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Middle-earth from "The Lord of the Rings"
6. Hogwarts from "Harry Potter"
7. Westeros from "Game of Thrones"
8. Arrakis from "Dune"
9. Asgard from "Thor"
10. Gotham City from "Batman"
11. Neverland from "Peter Pan"
12. Atlantis from "Atlantis: The Lost Empire"
13. Oz from "The Wizard of Oz"
14. Narnia from "The Chronicles of Narnia"
15. Cybertron from "Transformers"
16. Rivendell from "The Lord of the Rings"
17. Hyrule from "The Legend of Zelda"
18. Springfield from "The Simpsons"
19. Metropolis from "Superman"
20. Emerald City from "The Wizard of Oz"
21. Elantris from "Elantris" by Brandon Sanderson
22. Discworld from "Discworld" series
23. Rapture from "BioShock"
24. Sunnydale from "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
