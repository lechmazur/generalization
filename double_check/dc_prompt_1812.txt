Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in scientific research that have been named after fictional characters or stories

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Galileo's telescope named "The Looking Glass"
2. A research submarine called "Nautilus"
3. A particle accelerator dubbed "The Enterprise"
4. A weather balloon named "The Hindenburg"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A laboratory microscope
6. A centrifuge used in biology
7. A spectrometer in chemistry
8. An electron microscope
9. A Bunsen burner
10. A petri dish
11. A test tube
12. A beaker
13. A graduated cylinder
14. A pipette
15. A fume hood
16. A lab balance
17. A pH meter
18. A thermocycler
19. An autoclave
20. A laminar flow hood
21. A spectrophotometer
22. A gel electrophoresis apparatus
23. A mass spectrometer
24. An incubator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
