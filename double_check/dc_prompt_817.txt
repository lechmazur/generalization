Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical trade routes that significantly influenced the spread of scientific knowledge and technology across different civilizations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Silk Road connecting China and Europe through Central Asia
2. The Maritime Spice Routes linking the Mediterranean to India and Southeast Asia
3. The Trans-Saharan trade routes connecting North Africa to West Africa
4. The Incense Route connecting the Arabian Peninsula to the Mediterranean

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Oregon Trail
6. The Amber Road
7. The Tea Horse Road
8. The Roman Road System
9. The Hanseatic League trade network
10. The Phoenician maritime routes
11. The Santa Fe Trail
12. The Grand Trunk Road
13. The Khyber Pass
14. The Manila Galleon Trade Route
15. The Salt Route
16. The Tin Route
17. The Viking trade routes
18. The Mesopotamian trade network
19. The Aztec trade routes
20. The Portuguese India Route
21. The Fur Trade Route
22. The Tea Route
23. The Gold Road
24. The Jade Road

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
