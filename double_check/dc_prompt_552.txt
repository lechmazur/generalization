Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to contain information that were intentionally left blank by their creator.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A brand new, unused notebook
2. A fresh roll of unexposed film
3. An empty computer file created for future data entry
4. A blank canvas prepared for painting

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A cleared whiteboard
6. An erased chalkboard
7. A formatted hard drive
8. A forgotten, empty diary
9. A worn-out textbook with all the writing erased
10. A used sketchbook with pages torn out
11. A digital audio recorder with a deleted recording
12. A blank sheet of paper found on the street
13. A discarded, empty bottle
14. An empty picture frame
15. A cleared email inbox
16. A reset calculator
17. A blank wall
18. An empty birdhouse
19. A vacant parking space
20. A silent musical instrument
21. An unused microphone
22. A dark television screen
23. An empty jewelry box
24. A clean, empty plate

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
