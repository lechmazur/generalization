Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological breakthroughs that were initially theoretical and later achieved, leading to significant advancements in energy efficiency.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the development of photovoltaic cells based on quantum theory
2. the realization of nuclear fusion as a practical energy source
3. the creation of superconducting materials for lossless energy transmission
4. the implementation of thermoelectric materials for waste heat recovery

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the invention of the steam engine
6. the discovery of penicillin
7. the development of the internet
8. the creation of the first airplane
9. the invention of the light bulb
10. the discovery of DNA structure
11. the development of the printing press
12. the invention of the telephone
13. the creation of the first computer
14. the discovery of X-rays
15. the invention of the internal combustion engine
16. the development of the transistor
17. the creation of the first smartphone
18. the discovery of antibiotics
19. the invention of the wheel
20. the development of the first vaccine
21. the creation of the first electric car
22. the discovery of the Higgs boson
23. the invention of the microwave oven
24. the development of the first satellite

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
