Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize a closed-loop process to transform discarded or unwanted materials into a new product or resource specifically intended for gifting or ceremonial exchange.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A system that converts old wedding dresses into unique, handcrafted paper for crafting personalized gift cards for anniversaries.
2. A program that transforms used musical instruments into decorative pieces for use in cultural exchange ceremonies.
3. A process that recycles broken jewelry into new, bespoke pieces for gifting during traditional rites of passage.
4. A method that repurposes discarded books into custom-made bookmarks, gifted during literary festivals.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A recycling program that turns plastic bottles into new bottles.
6. A composting system that converts food waste into soil for gardening.
7. A machine that recycles aluminum cans into new cans.
8. A process that transforms old tires into rubber mulch for landscaping.
9. A system that converts waste paper into new paper products for commercial use.
10. A program that repurposes old electronics into new devices for sale.
11. A method that recycles glass bottles into sand for construction purposes.
12. A process that turns scrap metal into new metal products for industrial use.
13. A system that converts textile waste into insulation material for buildings.
14. A recycling initiative that transforms plastic bags into new bags for retail use.
15. A program that repurposes old furniture into new pieces for resale.
16. A method that recycles old batteries into new batteries for consumer electronics.
17. A system that converts organic waste into biogas for energy production.
18. A process that turns waste oil into biodiesel for transportation.
19. A recycling program that transforms old clothing into rags for industrial cleaning.
20. A method that repurposes discarded wood into new wooden products for home use.
21. A system that converts waste paper into cardboard for packaging.
22. A program that recycles old CDs into new CDs for data storage.
23. A process that turns scrap paper into new paper products for office use.
24. A method that repurposes old tires into playground surfaces for public use.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
