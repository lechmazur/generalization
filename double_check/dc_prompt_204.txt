Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Items worn by professionals that display visible signs of their trade's typical wear and tear

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A chef's white coat stained with tomato sauce and grease
2. A carpenter's worn-out tool belt with frayed edges and sawdust embedded in the fabric
3. A painter's overalls splattered with various colors of paint
4. A gardener's well-worn boots caked with mud and dirt

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A doctor's stethoscope
6. A lawyer's briefcase
7. A firefighter's helmet
8. A police officer's badge
9. A nurse's scrubs (clean)
10. A teacher's textbook
11. A musician's instrument
12. An athlete's jersey
13. A scientist's lab coat (clean)
14. A writer's pen
15. A programmer's keyboard
16. An architect's blueprints
17. An engineer's hard hat
18. A pilot's uniform
19. A flight attendant's scarf
20. A cashier's name tag
21. A librarian's glasses
22. A chef's knife
23. A mechanic's wrench
24. A construction worker's safety vest

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
