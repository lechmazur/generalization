Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations that serve as both a public-facing entity and a covert operational base

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A seemingly ordinary laundromat that acts as a front for an intelligence agency's surveillance operations.
2. A popular bookstore with a hidden back room used for clandestine meetings and document exchanges by a criminal organization.
3. A bustling flower shop where a team of assassins discreetly prepares and distributes their tools of the trade.
4. A busy travel agency that secretly facilitates the movement of smuggled goods and individuals across international borders.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A military base disguised as a research facility.
6. A secret underground bunker.
7. A private detective's home office.
8. A seemingly abandoned warehouse used for illegal activities.
9. A government agency with classified operations.
10. A hidden room in a private residence.
11. A spy's personal apartment.
12. A secure server room in a corporate headquarters.
13. An embassy conducting diplomatic missions.
14. A casino with a high-roller's private room.
15. A hospital with a restricted access wing.
16. A university laboratory conducting classified research.
17. A police station with an undercover unit.
18. A post office sorting mail.
19. A grocery store with a back office.
20. A bank with a secure vault.
21. A library with a rare books collection.
22. A museum with restricted archives.
23. A theater with backstage access.
24. A restaurant with a private dining room.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
