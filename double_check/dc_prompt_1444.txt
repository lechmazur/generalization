Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional ceremonies or rituals that involve deliberately breaking or transforming objects as symbols of healing or renewal

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. smashing plates during a Greek wedding to symbolize good luck and a fresh start
2. breaking a glass under the chuppah in a Jewish wedding to commemorate destruction and hope for renewal
3. burning effigies during the Burning Man festival to represent letting go of the past
4. shattering a clay pot during a Hindu ritual to release negative energy and invite prosperity

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. lighting candles during a religious ceremony
6. throwing rice at a wedding
7. wearing white clothing for purity
8. planting a tree to symbolize growth
9. ringing a bell to ward off evil spirits
10. tying a red string around the wrist for protection
11. burning incense during meditation
12. pouring water as an offering to ancestors
13. dancing around a maypole during a spring festival
14. writing wishes on paper lanterns and releasing them into the sky
15. carving pumpkins for Halloween
16. decorating eggs for Easter
17. wearing masks during Carnival
18. exchanging rings during a wedding ceremony
19. lighting fireworks to celebrate the New Year
20. singing hymns during a religious service
21. building sandcastles during a beach festival
22. waving flags during a national holiday
23. painting faces for a cultural celebration
24. carrying a torch in a relay race

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
