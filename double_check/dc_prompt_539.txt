Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools designed for precisely adjusting the angle or length of a wooden component using a blade and a mechanical advantage system.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mitre saw
2. Shooting board
3. Block plane
4. Shoulder plane

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hand saw
6. Circular saw
7. Jigsaw
8. Chainsaw
9. Table saw
10. Band saw
11. Hammer
12. Screwdriver
13. Drill
14. Chisel
15. Mallet
16. Rasp
17. File
18. Sandpaper
19. Wood lathe
20. Router
21. Spokeshave
22. Drawknife
23. Cabinet scraper
24. Marking gauge

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
