Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural materials or structures that exhibit unique mechanical properties due to their hierarchical organization at multiple scales

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. spider silk
2. nacre
3. bamboo
4. bone tissue

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. granite
6. steel beams
7. carbon fiber
8. rubber
9. plastic
10. concrete
11. glass
12. diamond
13. copper wire
14. aluminum foil
15. wood pulp
16. leather
17. cotton fiber
18. ceramic tiles
19. marble
20. kevlar
21. graphene
22. silica gel
23. polyester
24. cork

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
