Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Specialized software tools used by ergonomics consultants to analyze and prevent repetitive strain injuries in industrial workplaces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ErgoIntelligence UEA
2. 3DSSPP
3. JACK
4. NIOSH Lifting Equation Calculator Pro

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Microsoft Excel
6. AutoCAD
7. Safety inspection checklist app
8. Time tracking software
9. Factory floor planning tool
10. Employee scheduling system
11. Quality control database
12. Machine maintenance tracker
13. Workplace accident reporting system
14. Industrial hygiene monitoring software
15. PPE inventory management system
16. Assembly line simulation program
17. Employee training management software
18. Workplace noise measurement app
19. Chemical safety database
20. Production workflow analyzer
21. Equipment calibration tracker
22. Environmental monitoring system
23. Risk assessment matrix tool
24. Industrial compliance checker

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
