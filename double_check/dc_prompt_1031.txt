Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or algorithms that adaptively optimize performance based on real-time feedback or changing conditions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A thermostat that learns household temperature preferences over time
2. A recommendation engine that refines suggestions based on user interactions
3. A self-tuning database management system that adjusts query execution plans
4. A dynamic pricing algorithm that adjusts prices based on real-time demand

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A fixed schedule sprinkler system
6. A pre-programmed assembly line robot
7. A traditional cookbook recipe
8. A static traffic light timing system
9. A mechanical vending machine
10. A basic calculator
11. A printed train schedule
12. A manual thermostat
13. A fixed-route GPS navigation
14. A standard washing machine cycle
15. An analog clock
16. A traditional light switch
17. A paper map
18. A mechanical piano
19. A standard telephone directory
20. A conventional oven
21. A basic security alarm
22. A traditional doorbell
23. A manual coffee maker
24. A standard television remote

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
