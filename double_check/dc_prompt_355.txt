Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures built by pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures that incorporate representations of the Feathered Serpent deity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Temple of Quetzalcoatl at Teotihuacan
2. The Pyramid of the Magician at Uxmal
3. The Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza (partially)
4. Structure 33 at Yaxchilan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan
6. The Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque
7. Monte Albán
8. Chichén Itzá's El Castillo
9. Tikal Temple I
10. Copán's Hieroglyphic Stairway
11. Uxmal's Nunnery Quadrangle
12. Palenque's Palace
13. Bonampak murals
14. La Venta, Tabasco
15. Cerro de las Mesas
16. The Aztec Sun Stone
17. Codex Borgia
18. Mayan jade masks
19. Olmec colossal heads
20. Teotihuacan masks
21. Chac Mool statues
22. Tula Atlantean figures
23. El Tajin's Pyramid of the Niches
24. Becan

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
