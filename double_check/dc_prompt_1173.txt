Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Inventions or innovations that were initially dismissed or misunderstood but later revolutionized communication or information organization.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The telephone
2. The World Wide Web
3. The printing press
4. The personal computer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The steam engine
6. The light bulb
7. The airplane
8. The internal combustion engine
9. The refrigerator
10. The sewing machine
11. The electric motor
12. The washing machine
13. The microwave oven
14. The phonograph
15. The bicycle
16. The camera
17. The television
18. The automobile
19. The typewriter
20. The radio
21. The elevator
22. The vacuum cleaner
23. The air conditioner
24. The dishwasher

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
