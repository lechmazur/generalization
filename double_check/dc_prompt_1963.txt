Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Periodic cultural rituals involving combat or competition that were historically significant to specific civilizations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gladiatorial combats in Ancient Rome
2. The Olympic Games of Ancient Greece
3. The Aztec ritual of "flower wars"
4. The Mesopotamian Akitu festival's ritual combat between the king and a priest representing Marduk

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weekly poker game
6. Annual town festivals
7. Modern Olympic Games
8. Medieval jousting tournaments
9. A school spelling bee
10. A national chess championship
11. Thanksgiving dinner
12. A birthday party
13. A wedding ceremony
14. A funeral procession
15. Daily prayer rituals
16. Seasonal agricultural festivals
17. Military training exercises
18. Ancient Egyptian mummification rituals
19. Japanese tea ceremonies
20. Native American vision quests
21. A high school football game
22. A professional boxing match
23. A marathon race
24. A dog show

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
