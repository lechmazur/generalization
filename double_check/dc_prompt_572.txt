Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional works featuring a character who gains extraordinary abilities due to prolonged exposure to cosmic radiation emanating from a specific celestial object observable by a space telescope.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. In the novel "Celestial Awakening," the protagonist, Dr. Mira Patel, develops telekinetic powers after years of studying a mysterious pulsar through the Hubble Space Telescope.
2. The graphic novel "Stellar Surge" follows astronaut Jake Thompson, who gains superhuman strength and the ability to manipulate energy after being exposed to cosmic rays from a distant quasar observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
3. In the film "Cosmic Vision," scientist Elena Rodriguez acquires the power to see into the future after prolonged exposure to gamma rays from a neutron star, which she studies using the James Webb Space Telescope.
4. The short story "Radiant Destiny" features a character, Professor Leo Chen, who develops the ability to teleport after dedicating his career to observing cosmic radiation from a black hole using the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. In the movie "The Fantastic Four," the characters gain powers after exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission.
6. The comic book series "The Atom" features a scientist who shrinks after an accident involving a particle accelerator.
7. In "Spider-Man," Peter Parker gains spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.
8. The TV show "Heroes" includes characters who develop various powers due to a solar eclipse.
9. In the novel "Dune," characters gain heightened abilities from the spice melange, a substance found on the planet Arrakis.
10. The film "The Hulk" features a scientist who transforms into a giant after exposure to gamma radiation.
11. In "X-Men," mutants are born with their powers due to a genetic mutation.
12. The anime "Fullmetal Alchemist" involves characters who gain alchemical powers through a mystical process.
13. In the game "BioShock," characters gain powers from a substance called ADAM, derived from sea slugs.
14. The novel "The Invisible Man" features a scientist who becomes invisible after experimenting with optics.
15. In "The Flash," the protagonist gains super speed after a lightning strike combined with chemicals.
16. The movie "Lucy" involves a woman who gains enhanced abilities after a drug overdose.
17. In "Akira," characters develop psychic powers due to government experiments.
18. The TV series "Stranger Things" features children with powers resulting from secret government experiments.
19. In the novel "Flowers for Algernon," a man gains increased intelligence through a surgical procedure.
20. The film "Chronicle" follows teenagers who gain telekinetic powers after encountering a mysterious object.
21. In "The Matrix," characters gain abilities through a virtual reality program.
22. The comic "Green Lantern" features characters who gain powers from a ring powered by a central battery.
23. In the game "Mass Effect," characters gain biotic powers through exposure to element zero.
24. The novel "Brave New World" includes a drug called Soma that alters perception and mood.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
