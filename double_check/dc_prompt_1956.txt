Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional African religious ceremonies that involve divination or spiritual communication

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. divination bones
2. cowrie shells
3. oracle board
4. spirit mask

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a prayer rug
6. a rosary
7. a crucifix
8. a menorah
9. a Buddhist prayer wheel
10. a Hindu idol
11. a Native American dreamcatcher
12. a Tibetan singing bowl
13. a Japanese torii gate
14. a Greek oracle stone
15. a Celtic cross
16. a Shinto shrine
17. a Viking rune stone
18. a Christian Bible
19. a Muslim prayer bead
20. a Sikh kirpan
21. a Zoroastrian fire altar
22. a Taoist yin-yang symbol
23. a Confucian analects
24. a Jain statue

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
