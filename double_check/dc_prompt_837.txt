Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts that propose a fundamental shift in understanding human existence or societal structures, challenging traditional paradigms and requiring empirical evidence for validation or refutation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The theory that consciousness emerges from quantum processes in brain microtubules
2. The hypothesis that human behavior is primarily driven by unconscious algorithmic processes rather than free will
3. The proposition that cultural evolution follows predictable mathematical patterns similar to biological evolution
4. The theory that human cognition operates as a predictive processing system rather than a reactive one

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Democracy as a political system
6. The concept of moral relativism
7. Religious beliefs about the afterlife
8. Traditional gender roles in society
9. The idea of karma
10. Economic theories about market behavior
11. Philosophical arguments about free will
12. Theories about extraterrestrial life
13. Cultural differences in child-rearing
14. The role of education in society
15. Theories about historical cycles
16. The concept of social justice
17. Ideas about human nature
18. Theories of art and creativity
19. The nature of time and space
20. Concepts of personal identity
21. Theories about language acquisition
22. The role of technology in human evolution
23. Ideas about collective consciousness
24. Theories of emotional intelligence

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
