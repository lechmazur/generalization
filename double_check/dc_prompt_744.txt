Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that serve as both functional passageways and symbolic representations of transition or change.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Golden Gate Bridge
2. Triumphal Arch
3. Gateway Arch
4. Bridge of Sighs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Empire State Building
6. Colosseum
7. Great Wall of China
8. Statue of Liberty
9. Eiffel Tower
10. Big Ben
11. Leaning Tower of Pisa
12. Parthenon
13. Hagia Sophia
14. Burj Khalifa
15. Sydney Opera House
16. Stonehenge
17. Mount Rushmore
18. Christ the Redeemer
19. Petra
20. Taj Mahal
21. Notre-Dame Cathedral
22. Alhambra
23. Versailles Palace
24. Neuschwanstein Castle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
