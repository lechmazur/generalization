Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural objects that have been historically used as containers for collecting valuable liquids

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. gourd
2. coconut shell
3. hollowed-out bamboo
4. animal horn

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. clay pot
6. glass bottle
7. metal can
8. plastic jug
9. wooden barrel
10. ceramic vase
11. stone urn
12. woven basket
13. leather pouch
14. paper cup
15. tin box
16. steel flask
17. porcelain teapot
18. aluminum foil
19. rubber bladder
20. silk bag
21. bronze cauldron
22. plastic tub
23. glass jar
24. ceramic bowl

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
