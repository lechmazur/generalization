Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures designed for communal spiritual or ritualistic gatherings that are partially or fully subterranean.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Kiva at the Ancestral Puebloan site of Mesa Verde
2. The Hypogeum of Ħal Saflieni in Malta
3. The underground church of St. George in Lalibela, Ethiopia
4. The Mithraeum in London, England

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional Japanese tea house
6. The Sistine Chapel in Vatican City
7. A modern skyscraper
8. The Pantheon in Rome
9. A Buddhist temple in Thailand
10. The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul
11. A synagogue in New York City
12. A mosque in Dubai
13. The Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris
14. A Hindu temple in India
15. A Zoroastrian fire temple in Iran
16. The Temple of Heaven in Beijing
17. A Shinto shrine in Japan
18. The Western Wall in Jerusalem
19. A Sikh gurdwara in Punjab
20. The Great Pyramid of Giza
21. A Baháʼí House of Worship in Australia
22. The Stonehenge monument in England
23. A Jain temple in Rajasthan
24. The Parthenon in Athens

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
