Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations that fundamentally altered the approach to problem-solving in their respective fields by introducing a new framework or paradigm.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the development of quantum mechanics
2. the invention of the printing press
3. the introduction of the scientific method
4. the creation of the internet

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the discovery of penicillin
6. the invention of the light bulb
7. the development of the steam engine
8. the creation of the assembly line
9. the discovery of DNA structure
10. the invention of the telephone
11. the development of the airplane
12. the creation of the periodic table
13. the invention of the wheel
14. the discovery of electricity
15. the development of the computer
16. the invention of the camera
17. the creation of the telescope
18. the discovery of gravity
19. the invention of the refrigerator
20. the development of the automobile
21. the creation of the microscope
22. the invention of the radio
23. the discovery of X-rays
24. the development of the smartphone

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
