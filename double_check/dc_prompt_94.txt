Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or structures that exhibit cyclical patterns of growth and dormancy influenced by environmental factors

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Deciduous trees shedding leaves in autumn and regrowing them in spring
2. Annual wildflowers blooming in wet seasons and lying dormant in dry seasons
3. Hibernating animals entering a state of dormancy in winter and becoming active in spring
4. Coral reefs undergoing bleaching during warmer periods and recovering during cooler periods

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Seasons changing throughout the year
6. Migration patterns of birds
7. Tides rising and falling daily
8. Day and night cycles
9. Human hair growth and haircut cycles
10. Economic cycles of boom and bust
11. Stock market fluctuations
12. Menstrual cycles in humans
13. Sleep-wake cycles
14. Plant growth influenced by fertilizer application
15. Weather patterns influenced by climate change
16. Population growth and decline in cities
17. Life cycles of insects
18. Plant growth in response to light exposure
19. Water levels in reservoirs fluctuating due to rainfall
20. Changes in ocean currents
21. Annual cycles of tourism in coastal areas
22. Fluctuations in wildlife populations due to predation
23. Changes in river flow due to dam operations
24. Cycles of technological innovation and obsolescence

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
