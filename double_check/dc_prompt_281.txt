Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects composed primarily of translucent or transparent silica-based material that incorporate a visible, intentionally included foreign object.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a paperweight with a butterfly inside
2. a glass orb with a miniature ship inside
3. a crystal block with a laser-etched image inside
4. a resin pendant with a flower inside

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a glass window
6. a clear plastic bottle
7. a glass vase
8. a crystal chandelier
9. a glass of water
10. a transparent acrylic sheet
11. a glass sculpture
12. a clear quartz crystal
13. a glass jar
14. a stained glass window
15. a frosted glass door
16. a glass beaker
17. a glass fish tank
18. a clear glass bowl
19. a glass test tube
20. a glass bottle
21. a glass mirror
22. a glass lens
23. a glass ashtray
24. a glass mosaic

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
