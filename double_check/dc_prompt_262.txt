Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical settlements that disappeared without clear explanation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Roanoke Colony
2. Cahokia
3. Angkor
4. Nabta Playa

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Pompeii
6. Machu Picchu
7. Petra
8. Troy
9. Teotihuacan
10. Great Zimbabwe
11. Mohenjo-Daro
12. Easter Island
13. Babylon
14. Chichen Itza
15. Hattusa
16. Mycenae
17. Knossos
18. Caral
19. Palmyra
20. Persepolis
21. Tiwanaku
22. Ubar
23. Chan Chan
24. Catalhoyuk

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
