Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Metallic elements that form body-centered cubic crystal structures at room temperature

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chromium
2. Iron
3. Tungsten
4. Vanadium

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gold
6. Silver
7. Copper
8. Aluminum
9. Lead
10. Zinc
11. Titanium
12. Platinum
13. Nickel
14. Cobalt
15. Manganese
16. Magnesium
17. Beryllium
18. Palladium
19. Iridium
20. Rhodium
21. Osmium
22. Ruthenium
23. Calcium
24. Lithium

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
