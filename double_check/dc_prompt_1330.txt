Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures that utilize modular, interchangeable components to optimize efficiency in repetitive or cyclic processes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. An automated assembly line producing cars, where robotic arms perform specific tasks like welding or painting, and can be reprogrammed and swapped for different models or processes.
2. A modular synthesizer, where individual components (oscillators, filters, sequencers) can be connected and reconfigured to create a wide range of sounds and musical patterns.
3. A software development kit (SDK) providing pre-built code modules for common functionalities, allowing developers to integrate them into their applications and customize them as needed.
4. A high-throughput screening system in drug discovery, where robotic systems automate the testing of thousands of compounds against biological targets, using interchangeable plates and reagents.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bicycle chain
6. A zipper
7. A train track
8. A conveyor belt
9. A network of blood vessels
10. A power grid
11. A supply chain
12. A food web
13. A computer network
14. A social network
15. A neural network
16. A highway system
17. A plumbing system
18. An electrical circuit
19. A clockwork mechanism
20. A set of LEGO bricks
21. A jigsaw puzzle
22. A deck of cards
23. A set of dominoes
24. A Rubik's Cube

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
