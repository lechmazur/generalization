Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or objects that involve a process of removing an outer layer to reveal a functional or essential component underneath

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Peeling a banana
2. Shucking an oyster
3. Removing the husk from an ear of corn
4. Unwrapping a candy bar

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Opening a present
6. Taking off a jacket
7. Breaking an egg
8. Cutting hair
9. Sharpening a pencil
10. Sanding wood
11. Digging a hole
12. Mining for gold
13. Shelling peanuts
14. Slicing bread
15. Chopping vegetables
16. Grating cheese
17. Filtering water
18. Cracking a nut
19. Cleaning a fish
20. Butchering meat
21. Skinning an animal
22. Excavating a fossil
23. Unboxing a new phone
24. Removing makeup

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
