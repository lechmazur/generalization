Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or tools that combine elements of art and technology to enhance understanding or visualization of complex data.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. an interactive data visualization platform that uses color gradients and 3D modeling to represent climate change trends
2. a virtual reality art installation that transforms scientific data about black holes into immersive visual and auditory experiences
3. a generative art tool that uses machine learning to create abstract visuals based on real-time financial market data
4. a holographic projection system that maps genetic sequences into dynamic, interactive sculptures

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a spreadsheet software for organizing numerical data
6. a traditional bar graph showing sales trends
7. a paintbrush used for creating oil paintings
8. a calculator for solving mathematical equations
9. a camera used for capturing photographs
10. a music streaming app that recommends songs based on user preferences
11. a digital thermometer displaying temperature readings
12. a word processor for writing essays
13. a GPS navigation system for driving directions
14. a stopwatch for timing athletic events
15. a microscope for examining biological samples
16. a whiteboard for brainstorming ideas
17. a video game console for playing interactive games
18. a printer for producing physical copies of documents
19. a telescope for observing celestial objects
20. a digital audio workstation for recording music
21. a fitness tracker for monitoring physical activity
22. a smartwatch for receiving notifications
23. a projector for displaying slideshows
24. a robotic arm used in manufacturing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
