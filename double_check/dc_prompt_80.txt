Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical events that resulted in the permanent division of a major religious institution into two or more distinct branches

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Great Schism of 1054, which split Christianity into the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church
2. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, leading to the division of Western Christianity into Catholicism and Protestantism
3. The split between Sunni and Shia Islam following the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE
4. The formation of the Old Catholic Church after the First Vatican Council in 1870 due to disagreements over papal infallibility

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, which addressed theological disputes but did not result in a permanent division
6. The establishment of the Anglican Church under Henry VIII in the 16th century
7. The rise of Sufism as a mystical branch within Islam
8. The spread of Buddhism from India to East Asia
9. The founding of the Mormon Church in the 19th century
10. The Second Great Awakening in the United States during the early 19th century
11. The split between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism in ancient times
12. The emergence of the Hasidic movement within Judaism in the 18th century
13. The formation of the Unitarian Universalist Association in the 20th century
14. The rise of the Jehovah's Witnesses in the late 19th century
15. The establishment of the Quaker movement in the 17th century
16. The spread of Christianity to the Roman Empire
17. The development of the Kabbalah tradition within Judaism
18. The rise of the Amish community in the 17th century
19. The formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 19th century
20. The spread of Hinduism across Southeast Asia
21. The rise of the Pentecostal movement in the early 20th century
22. The establishment of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt
23. The spread of Zoroastrianism in ancient Persia
24. The rise of the Bahá'í Faith in the 19th century

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
