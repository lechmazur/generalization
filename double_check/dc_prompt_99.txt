Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Elements or inventions that were discovered or created in the 20th century and have a significant impact on scientific or navigational advancements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the Global Positioning System (GPS)
2. the transistor
3. the laser
4. the Hubble Space Telescope

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the steam engine
6. the printing press
7. the compass
8. the telegraph
9. the light bulb
10. the airplane
11. the telephone
12. the microscope
13. the telescope
14. the wheel
15. the abacus
16. the cotton gin
17. the typewriter
18. the radio
19. the internal combustion engine
20. the plow
21. the sextant
22. the barometer
23. the chronometer
24. the astrolabe

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
