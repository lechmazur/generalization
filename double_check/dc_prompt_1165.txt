Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that use symmetrical, repeating patterns to enhance functionality or aesthetic appeal, where the symmetry is both visually identifiable and integral to their purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A diatom's silica shell
2. A honeycomb in a beehive
3. A parabolic antenna
4. A Fresnel lens

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A snowflake
6. A nautilus shell
7. A spiderweb
8. A human face
9. A butterfly's wings
10. A sunflower head
11. A Roman arch
12. A geodesic dome
13. A kaleidoscope pattern
14. A chain link fence
15. A zipper
16. A DNA molecule
17. A crystal lattice
18. A tiled floor
19. A woven tapestry
20. A printed circuit board
21. A QR code
22. A musical score
23. A gear train
24. A turbine blade

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
