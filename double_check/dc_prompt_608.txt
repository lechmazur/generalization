Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products first advertised on television during the original airing of the television show "I Love Lucy"

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cheerios
2. Scott Towels
3. Philip Morris Cigarettes
4. Alka-Seltzer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. First product advertised on radio
6. Product advertised during the Super Bowl
7. First product advertised on the internet
8. Product advertised during the first episode of "The Tonight Show"
9. Product advertised during the first episode of "Seinfeld"
10. First product advertised in a magazine
11. Product advertised during the first episode of "Friends"
12. First product advertised in a newspaper
13. Product advertised during the first episode of "The Simpsons"
14. Product advertised during the first episode of "Saturday Night Live"
15. First product advertised on a billboard
16. Product advertised during the first episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show"
17. First product advertised in a movie theater
18. Product advertised during the first episode of "The Cosby Show"
19. First product advertised on a podcast
20. Product advertised during the first episode of "Cheers"
21. First product advertised on social media
22. Product advertised during the first episode of "M*A*S*H"
23. First product advertised on a streaming service
24. Product advertised during the first episode of "All in the Family"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
