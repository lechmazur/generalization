Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to be held in one hand that incorporate a mechanism for controlled, sequential reveal of information.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A device that displays a new word or phrase each time a button is pressed.
2. A tool that reveals a sequence of numbers when a dial is turned.
3. An instrument that shows a series of images as a lever is moved.
4. A gadget that uncovers a set of symbols with each twist of a knob.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A book with pages that turn to reveal new content.
6. A smartphone app that scrolls through information.
7. A deck of cards used for a magic trick.
8. A remote control that changes TV channels.
9. A pen that writes in different colors with each click.
10. A flashlight that can switch between different light modes.
11. A music player that shuffles through songs.
12. A camera that cycles through different photo filters.
13. A toy car that moves forward with each press of a button.
14. A kitchen timer that counts down time.
15. A calculator that performs sequential operations.
16. A game controller that navigates through menus.
17. A fitness tracker that displays different metrics.
18. A digital watch that shows time in different formats.
19. A voice recorder that plays back recorded messages.
20. A thermometer that displays temperature readings.
21. A compass that points to different directions.
22. A magnifying glass used to examine details.
23. A key that unlocks a door.
24. A bottle opener that removes bottle caps.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
