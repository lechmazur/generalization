Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures unintentionally repurposed by specific bird species as primary nesting sites within urban environments.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chimneys used by chimney swifts
2. Bridges used by peregrine falcons
3. Streetlights used by house sparrows
4. Building ledges used by pigeons

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Tree branches used by robins
6. Cliffs used by eagles
7. Ground burrows used by burrowing owls
8. Reeds used by marsh wrens
9. Hollow trees used by woodpeckers
10. Riverbanks used by kingfishers
11. Desert cacti used by cactus wrens
12. Forest canopies used by orioles
13. Rock crevices used by swallows
14. Sand dunes used by plovers
15. Coral reefs used by seabirds
16. Mountain ledges used by condors
17. Grasslands used by meadowlarks
18. Wetlands used by herons
19. Snowbanks used by snow buntings
20. Open fields used by skylarks
21. Dense bushes used by sparrows
22. Seashores used by gulls
23. Old barns used by barn owls
24. Fallen logs used by nuthatches

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
