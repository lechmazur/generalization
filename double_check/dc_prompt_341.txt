Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for human use that incorporate a network of interconnected channels for directing the flow of a specific gas or liquid, where the network is visible from the exterior.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. radiator
2. drip irrigation system
3. hookah pipe
4. laboratory distillation apparatus

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. garden hose
6. drinking straw
7. underground pipeline
8. blood vessel
9. air conditioning duct
10. water bottle
11. fuel tank
12. coffee maker
13. plumbing pipes
14. electrical conduit
15. subway tunnel
16. ventilation shaft
17. pneumatic tube system
18. sewer line
19. gas mask
20. water meter
21. fire sprinkler
22. oil pipeline
23. vacuum cleaner hose
24. bicycle tire pump

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
