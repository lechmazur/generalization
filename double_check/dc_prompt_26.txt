Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Japanese woodblock prints from the Edo period depicting dream-like landscapes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A serene mountain peak shrouded in mist, with a lone traveler crossing a delicate bridge over a cascading waterfall.
2. A moonlit forest with glowing fireflies illuminating the path of a wandering poet.
3. A tranquil lake reflecting a surreal sky filled with floating islands and ethereal clouds.
4. A coastal village bathed in golden light, with fishermen casting nets into a sea of shimmering waves.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern abstract painting with bold geometric shapes and vibrant colors.
6. A Renaissance portrait of a noblewoman holding a fan.
7. A black-and-white photograph of a bustling city street in the 1920s.
8. A medieval illuminated manuscript depicting a biblical scene.
9. A contemporary digital artwork of a futuristic cityscape.
10. A Greek vase painting showing a mythological battle.
11. A Baroque still life of fruit and flowers.
12. A cave painting of hunting scenes from prehistoric times.
13. A surrealist painting of melting clocks in a desert.
14. A Roman mosaic of a gladiator in combat.
15. A 19th-century oil painting of a European countryside.
16. A pop art collage featuring comic book characters.
17. A minimalist sculpture of a human figure.
18. A Chinese ink painting of bamboo and birds.
19. A Victorian-era portrait of a family in formal attire.
20. A Native American pottery design with intricate patterns.
21. A Flemish tapestry depicting a royal procession.
22. A 20th-century poster advertising a circus.
23. A Persian miniature painting of a garden scene.
24. A modern graffiti mural on an urban wall.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
