Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies developed to interpret natural phenomena through non-traditional scientific methods

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. dowsing rods for water detection
2. crystal pendulums for energy field measurement
3. aura photography cameras
4. kirlian imaging devices

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. microscopes
6. seismographs
7. weather balloons
8. telescopes
9. spectrometers
10. barometers
11. compasses
12. thermometers
13. sundials
14. astrolabes
15. wind vanes
16. rain gauges
17. pH meters
18. Geiger counters
19. metal detectors
20. sonar devices
21. radar systems
22. satellite imaging
23. electromagnetic sensors
24. infrared cameras

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
