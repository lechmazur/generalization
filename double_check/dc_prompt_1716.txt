Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient philosophical or religious concepts that were later repurposed as modern economic theories or business practices

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The concept of karma being used to develop a rewards and loyalty program in a business.
2. The idea of dharma being repurposed as a corporate mission statement or ethical guideline.
3. The principle of wu wei from Taoism being applied to lean management and efficiency in business operations.
4. The Buddhist concept of impermanence being used to justify flexible and adaptive business strategies.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The use of meditation techniques in corporate wellness programs.
6. The application of Stoic philosophy in personal development courses for business leaders.
7. The integration of Confucian values in educational systems to promote discipline and respect.
8. The use of the Golden Rule in customer service training.
9. The adoption of Zen principles in product design to enhance user experience.
10. The influence of Aristotelian ethics on modern moral philosophy.
11. The use of Socratic questioning in leadership training to foster critical thinking.
12. The application of Epicureanism in lifestyle branding to promote simplicity and pleasure.
13. The incorporation of Shinto rituals in Japanese corporate culture to enhance team cohesion.
14. The use of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings in personal motivation seminars.
15. The influence of Platonic ideals on the concept of perfect forms in art and design.
16. The use of Taoist principles in environmental sustainability initiatives.
17. The application of Jainism's non-violence principle in animal rights activism.
18. The use of the concept of yin and yang in balancing work and life in corporate wellness programs.
19. The influence of the Ten Commandments in shaping legal systems.
20. The use of the concept of Nirvana in marketing campaigns for relaxation products.
21. The application of the Four Noble Truths in addiction recovery programs.
22. The use of the concept of the soul in discussions about artificial intelligence and consciousness.
23. The influence of the concept of reincarnation in discussions about sustainability and resource management.
24. The use of the concept of the afterlife in financial planning and estate management.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
