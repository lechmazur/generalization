Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures that rely on decentralized, interconnected nodes to optimize flow, communication, or security

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A mesh network of Wi-Fi routers
2. The human nervous system
3. A blockchain-based cryptocurrency
4. Ant colonies foraging for food

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A centralized server farm
6. A telephone switchboard
7. A hierarchical corporate structure
8. A single-lane highway
9. A chain letter
10. A tree's root system
11. A river delta
12. The veins in a leaf
13. A spider web
14. A school of fish
15. A flock of birds
16. A pack of wolves
17. A library catalog system
18. The postal service
19. A supply chain
20. A railroad network
21. An electrical grid
22. The internet (as a whole)
23. A social network platform
24. A global shipping network

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
