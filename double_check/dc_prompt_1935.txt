Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Portraits of celebrities painted by artists known for their distinctive styles

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Andy Warhol's silkscreen portrait of Marilyn Monroe
2. Pablo Picasso's cubist portrait of Dora Maar
3. Chuck Close's photorealistic portrait of Brad Pitt
4. Frida Kahlo's surrealist self-portrait with a thorn necklace and hummingbird

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A photograph of a celebrity
6. A caricature of a politician
7. A Renaissance painting of a noble
8. A street artist's mural of a musician
9. A child's drawing of their favorite superhero
10. A digital painting of a video game character
11. A sculpture of a historical figure
12. An abstract painting inspired by a song
13. A landscape painting by Claude Monet
14. A still life painting by Vincent van Gogh
15. A self-portrait by Rembrandt
16. A portrait by an unknown artist
17. A movie poster featuring a celebrity
18. A magazine cover with a celebrity photograph
19. A fashion illustration of a model
20. A sketch of a person in a cafe
21. A holographic portrait of a pop star
22. An album cover featuring a band portrait
23. A painted portrait of a fictional character
24. A portrait generated by artificial intelligence

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
