Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Intricate repeating patterns that serve as both decorative elements and functional mechanisms for distributing force or energy across a surface

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A honeycomb structure used in aerospace engineering
2. The weave pattern of a Kevlar vest
3. The lattice design on a suspension bridge's deck
4. The filigree pattern on a traditional Moroccan lamp

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A simple grid pattern on a piece of graph paper
6. The stripes on a zebra
7. A floral print on a dress
8. The texture of a brick wall
9. A polka dot pattern on a shirt
10. The design of a Persian rug
11. A checkered flag used in racing
12. The pattern of tiles on a bathroom floor
13. A camouflage pattern on military clothing
14. The stripes on a barber's pole
15. A paisley pattern on a scarf
16. The design of a stained glass window
17. A tartan pattern on a kilt
18. The pattern of a fingerprint
19. A herringbone pattern on a jacket
20. The design of a mosaic
21. A gingham pattern on a tablecloth
22. The pattern of a snowflake
23. A damask pattern on wallpaper
24. The design of a mandala

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
