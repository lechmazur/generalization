Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials used in traditional pottery that are fired at temperatures above 1200Â°C

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. porcelain clay
2. kaolin
3. ball clay
4. feldspar

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. terracotta
6. earthenware
7. stoneware
8. glazed ceramics
9. unglazed pottery
10. clay figurines
11. ceramic tiles
12. pottery wheels
13. kiln shelves
14. ceramic glazes
15. slip casting molds
16. ceramic brushes
17. pottery tools
18. ceramic pigments
19. low-fire clay
20. ceramic kilns
21. ceramic vases
22. ceramic bowls
23. ceramic plates
24. ceramic mugs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
