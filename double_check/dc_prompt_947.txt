Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or processes that involve a significant change in state or phase due to external influences

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Dew condensing on grass in the early morning
2. Rock weathering and eroding due to wind and rain
3. An ice cube melting in a glass of water
4. Food spoilage due to bacterial growth

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A plant growing taller
6. A car rusting
7. A child learning to ride a bike
8. A river flowing downstream
9. A fire burning
10. A seed germinating
11. An apple falling from a tree
12. A volcano erupting
13. The Earth revolving around the Sun
14. A bird building a nest
15. A dog barking
16. A cat chasing a mouse
17. A person breathing
18. A computer processing information
19. A light bulb emitting light
20. A radio playing music
21. A phone ringing
22. A book being read
23. A cake being baked
24. A song being sung

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
