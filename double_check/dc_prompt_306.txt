Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Garments designed to be worn as the outermost layer, made primarily of felted wool, and featuring a hood integral to the main body of the garment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A hooded cloak made of thick felted wool, reaching to the ankles.
2. A felted wool hooded cape, fastened at the neck with a wooden toggle.
3. A child's hooded felted wool jacket, with a colorful embroidered trim around the hood.
4. A felted wool hooded poncho, with a geometric pattern created through different colored wools.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A wool scarf
6. A leather jacket
7. A cotton hoodie
8. A knitted wool hat
9. A down-filled parka
10. A raincoat
11. A denim jacket
12. A blazer
13. A fleece vest
14. A silk kimono
15. A linen shirt
16. A pair of wool gloves
17. A fur coat
18. A knitted wool sweater
19. A baseball cap
20. A pair of leather boots
21. A wool blanket
22. A felted wool bag
23. A hooded sweatshirt made of cotton
24. A detachable hood made of felted wool

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
