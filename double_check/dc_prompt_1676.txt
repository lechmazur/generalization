Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or events that were widely considered mythical or impossible until scientifically documented in the 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ball lightning
2. Giant squid
3. Plate tectonics
4. Deep-sea hydrothermal vents

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Rainbows
6. Solar eclipses
7. Thunderstorms
8. Volcanic eruptions
9. Earthquakes
10. Hurricanes
11. Tornadoes
12. Snowfall
13. Lightning
14. Ocean tides
15. Monsoons
16. Fog
17. Cloud formation
18. Wind patterns
19. Glaciers
20. Desertification
21. Coral reefs
22. Rainforests
23. Sand dunes
24. Icebergs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
