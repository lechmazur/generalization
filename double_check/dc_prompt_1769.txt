Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or processes that involve the interaction of two or more components leading to pattern formation or modification.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Neural networks in the brain forming and modifying memory patterns through the interaction of neurons.
2. Ecosystem dynamics where predator-prey relationships lead to population fluctuations and patterns.
3. Chemical reactions in a Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction creating oscillating patterns due to interacting chemical species.
4. Weather systems where the interaction of air masses leads to the formation of weather patterns like cyclones.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A single gear in a mechanical clock.
6. The process of photosynthesis in a single plant cell.
7. A solitary ant moving in a straight line.
8. A single musical note played on a piano.
9. The growth of a single crystal in a solution.
10. A lone planet orbiting a star.
11. A single bacterium dividing in a petri dish.
12. The flow of water in a straight pipe.
13. A single electron moving in a vacuum.
14. The color change of a single chameleon.
15. A single seed germinating in soil.
16. The beating of a single heart in isolation.
17. A single cloud drifting in the sky.
18. The movement of a single sand dune.
19. A single firefly flashing its light.
20. The ripening of a single fruit on a tree.
21. A single snowflake falling from the sky.
22. The vibration of a single guitar string.
23. A single wave in the ocean.
24. The expansion of a single balloon.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
