Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific instruments from before 1900 that were primarily made of brass and are still manufactured today using similar materials and designs

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. astrolabe
2. sextant
3. brass microscope
4. brass barometer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. telescope
6. compass
7. thermometer
8. anemometer
9. sundial
10. astronomical clock
11. gyroscope
12. spectroscope
13. galvanometer
14. orrery
15. armillary sphere
16. planetarium projector
17. seismograph
18. hygrometer
19. chronometer
20. quadrant
21. mercury barometer
22. electroscope
23. camera obscura
24. kaleidoscope

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
