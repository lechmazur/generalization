Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures who have a university named after them in their home country

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. George Washington
2. John F. Kennedy
3. Mahatma Gandhi
4. Nelson Mandela

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Albert Einstein
6. Marie Curie
7. Isaac Newton
8. Charles Darwin
9. Leonardo da Vinci
10. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
11. William Shakespeare
12. Thomas Edison
13. Benjamin Franklin
14. Alexander Graham Bell
15. Henry Ford
16. Wright Brothers
17. Christopher Columbus
18. Amelia Earhart
19. Neil Armstrong
20. Martin Luther King Jr.
21. Florence Nightingale
22. Confucius
23. Socrates
24. Plato

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
