Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Events or phenomena documented in writing prior to 1000 CE that caused widespread, multi-year declines in economic activity across a geographically significant area.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Antonine Plague
2. The Crisis of the Third Century
3. The fall of the Western Roman Empire
4. The An Lushan Rebellion

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Black Death
6. The Great Depression
7. The 2008 Financial Crisis
8. The Dust Bowl
9. The Spanish Flu
10. The fall of the Soviet Union
11. The Opium Wars
12. The Mongol invasions
13. The Taiping Rebellion
14. The Thirty Years' War
15. The Napoleonic Wars
16. The American Civil War
17. The World War I
18. The World War II
19. The Cold War
20. The Irish Potato Famine
21. The Viking raids
22. The Crusades
23. The Hundred Years' War
24. The Byzantine Iconoclasm

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
