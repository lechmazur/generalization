Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Navigation tools that divide a circle into 32 equal parts for directional guidance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A compass rose with 32 rhumb lines.
2. A wind rose diagram divided into 32 sectors.
3. A navigational star chart with a 32-point overlay grid.
4. A ship's wheel with 32 markings around its circumference for precise steering.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A pie chart
6. A dartboard
7. A clock face
8. A protractor
9. A color wheel
10. A pizza cut into 8 slices
11. A globe
12. Lines of latitude
13. Lines of longitude
14. A map
15. A sextant
16. A GPS device
17. A speedometer
18. An astrolabe
19. A kaleidoscope
20. A sunflower head
21. A CD
22. A vinyl record
23. A potentiometer knob
24. A steering wheel with power steering

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
