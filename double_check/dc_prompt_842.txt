Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional characters who are the eldest sibling in a family and have a significant storyline involving their struggle with family responsibilities.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Brady from "The Brady Bunch" who often navigates the challenges of leading his blended family.
2. Frank from "Fiddler on the Roof" who deals with the pressures of maintaining family traditions and supporting his siblings.
3. Jo from "Little Women" who takes on significant responsibilities to support her family after their father leaves for war.
4. Hermione Granger from "Harry Potter" who, as the eldest child in her family, often feels the weight of setting a good example for her younger siblings.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Harry Potter, who struggles with his identity and destiny.
6. Elizabeth Bennet from "Pride and Prejudice," who navigates societal expectations and family dynamics.
7. Luke Skywalker, who faces the burden of saving the galaxy.
8. Scarlett O'Hara from "Gone with the Wind," who manages her family's plantation during turbulent times.
9. Odysseus, who is challenged by his long journey home to his family.
10. Jane Eyre, who overcomes personal hardships and seeks a sense of belonging.
11. Atticus Finch from "To Kill a Mockingbird," who instills values in his children amidst societal conflict.
12. Katniss Everdeen from "The Hunger Games," who takes on the role of protector for her family and district.
13. Emma Woodhouse from "Emma," who meddles in the lives of those around her.
14. Holden Caulfield from "The Catcher in the Rye," who grapples with adolescence and alienation.
15. Jay Gatsby from "The Great Gatsby," who pursues an idealized version of the American Dream.
16. Anna Karenina, who struggles with societal norms and personal desires.
17. Hamlet, who is torn between avenging his father's death and his own moral dilemmas.
18. Elizabeth Costello, who reflects on her life and career as a writer.
19. Don Quixote, who embarks on a quest driven by his chivalric ideals.
20. Jane Austen's Mr. Darcy, who must overcome his pride to find love.
21. Raskolnikov from "Crime and Punishment," who wrestles with guilt and redemption.
22. Heathcliff from "Wuthering Heights," who is consumed by passion and revenge.
23. Pi Patel from "Life of Pi," who survives a harrowing journey at sea.
24. Clarissa Dalloway from "Mrs. Dalloway," who reflects on her life choices and societal roles.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
