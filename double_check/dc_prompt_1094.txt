Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or concepts that originated as practical solutions to specific problems but later evolved into cultural or artistic symbols with broader significance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. wedding rings
2. gargoyles
3. Christmas trees
4. high heels

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. traffic lights
6. paper clips
7. umbrellas
8. calendars
9. clocks
10. compasses
11. mirrors
12. pottery
13. wheels
14. bridges
15. flags
16. coins
17. tattoos
18. masks
19. crowns
20. swords
21. drums
22. totems
23. pyramids
24. sundials

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
