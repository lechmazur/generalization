Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): man-made structures designed for long-distance signal transmission in harsh environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Submarine communication cable
2. Satellite communication dish
3. Oil rig communication tower
4. Desert radio relay station

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cell phone
6. Walkie-talkie
7. Television set
8. Home Wi-Fi router
9. Bluetooth speaker
10. Smartwatch
11. Landline telephone
12. Portable radio
13. Smart thermostat
14. Satellite TV receiver
15. Internet modem
16. Drone remote control
17. GPS navigation device
18. Smart home hub
19. Wireless keyboard
20. Digital camera
21. Smart refrigerator
22. Electric car charging station
23. Weather satellite
24. Space telescope

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
