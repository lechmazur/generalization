Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Phenomena or concepts that involve the manipulation or distortion of space-time in theoretical physics.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Wormholes
2. Alcubierre drive
3. Frame dragging
4. Gravitational lensing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Time dilation
6. Length contraction
7. Black hole singularity
8. Event horizon
9. Gravitational waves
10. Quantum entanglement
11. Special relativity
12. General relativity
13. Spacetime curvature
14. Cosmic inflation
15. Big Bang
16. Dark energy
17. Dark matter
18. Redshift
19. Blueshift
20. Doppler effect
21. Quantum foam
22. String theory
23. M-theory
24. Hyperspace

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
