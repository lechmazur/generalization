Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): ancient structures used as burial sites for royalty

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Pyramid of Khufu
2. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
3. The Tomb of Cyrus the Great
4. The Royal Tombs of Ur

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Colosseum
6. The Parthenon
7. Stonehenge
8. The Great Wall of China
9. Machu Picchu
10. Angkor Wat
11. The Taj Mahal
12. Westminster Abbey
13. The Valley of the Kings
14. The Catacombs of Paris
15. The Terracotta Army
16. Hagia Sophia
17. Newgrange
18. GÃ¶bekli Tepe
19. The Pantheon
20. Chichen Itza
21. Petra
22. The Leshan Giant Buddha
23. Mount Nemrut
24. Skara Brae

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
