Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Weapons or tools that were banned by papal decree between 1100-1500 CE

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Crossbow (Lateran Council, 1139)
2. Arbalest (Lateran Council, 1139)
3. Certain types of daggers (Various decrees concerning duels and assassinations)
4. Bows and arrows (against Christians, Second Lateran Council, 1139)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gunpowder
6. Trebuchet
7. Catapult
8. Siege weaponry
9. Longsword
10. Mace
11. Morning Star
12. Halberd
13. Pike
14. Dagger (general)
15. Sword (general)
16. Heresy
17. Blasphemy
18. Usury
19. Simony
20. Excommunication
21. Interdict
22. Printing Press
23. Alchemy
24. Astrology

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
