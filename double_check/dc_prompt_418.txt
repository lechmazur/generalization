Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures incorporating repurposed biological materials as primary structural elements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A building facade made from compressed recycled oyster shells
2. A bridge constructed using beams made from recycled wood fibers and resin
3. A pavilion roof supported by columns made from recycled corn stalks
4. A walkway supported by arches made from recycled bamboo fibers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A skyscraper made from steel and glass
6. A house built with traditional brick and mortar
7. A dam constructed using concrete
8. A suspension bridge made from steel cables
9. A wooden cabin built from freshly cut timber
10. A greenhouse made from aluminum and plastic
11. A stadium constructed with reinforced concrete
12. A tower made from prefabricated concrete panels
13. A barn built using new wooden beams
14. A factory made from steel frames and corrugated metal
15. A shopping mall constructed with glass and steel
16. A residential complex built with concrete blocks
17. A museum made from stone and glass
18. A library constructed with brick and steel
19. A school built using traditional wood framing
20. A hospital made from concrete and glass
21. A hotel constructed with steel and concrete
22. A church built with stone and wood
23. A theater made from brick and steel
24. A government building constructed with marble and glass

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
