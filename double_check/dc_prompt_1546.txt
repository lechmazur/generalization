Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or devices designed to repeatedly perform the same motion while concealing the human form behind them

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A grandfather clock with a swinging pendulum
2. A cuckoo clock with an automated bird
3. An automated waving hand sculpture
4. A mechanical nodding dog figurine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A wind-up toy car
6. A metronome
7. A revolving door
8. A ceiling fan
9. A washing machine
10. A conveyor belt
11. A rocking chair
12. A swing set
13. A seesaw
14. A merry-go-round
15. A Ferris wheel
16. A treadmill
17. A bicycle
18. A yo-yo
19. A spinning top
20. A wind turbine
21. A water wheel
22. A piston in an engine
23. A robot arm in a factory
24. A vending machine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
