Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations where radio towers were built on sites of former Buddhist temples in East Asian cities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tokyo Skytree in Tokyo, Japan
2. Seoul Tower in Seoul, South Korea
3. Dragon Tower in Harbin, China
4. Kyoto Tower in Kyoto, Japan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Statue of Liberty in New York City, USA
6. Eiffel Tower in Paris, France
7. Big Ben in London, UK
8. Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia
9. Great Wall of China in China
10. Taj Mahal in Agra, India
11. Colosseum in Rome, Italy
12. Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
13. Pyramids of Giza in Egypt
14. Machu Picchu in Peru
15. Angkor Wat in Cambodia
16. Stonehenge in Wiltshire, UK
17. Acropolis in Athens, Greece
18. Leaning Tower of Pisa in Pisa, Italy
19. Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, USA
20. Empire State Building in New York City, USA
21. Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE
22. Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
23. Tokyo Tower in Tokyo, Japan
24. Space Needle in Seattle, USA

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
