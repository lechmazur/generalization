Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or entities that combine a functional or practical purpose with an unexpected or incongruous aesthetic or symbolic feature

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A toilet plunger adorned with a glittering, rhinestone-encrusted handle
2. A sturdy, practical toolbox painted with a delicate floral pattern and finished with a layer of high-gloss varnish
3. A fire extinguisher shaped like a whimsical, oversized garden gnome
4. A simple, everyday stapler designed to resemble a miniature, chrome-plated motorcycle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A brightly colored raincoat
6. A pair of novelty socks with cartoon characters
7. A whimsical, hand-painted birdhouse
8. A decorative throw pillow shaped like a giant hamburger
9. A vintage rotary telephone
10. A handcrafted wooden chess set
11. A sleek, modern coffee maker
12. A set of ornate silverware
13. A brightly colored umbrella with a unique handle
14. A pair of designer sunglasses
15. A hand-knitted scarf with an intricate pattern
16. A piece of abstract art
17. A vintage record player
18. A collection of antique teacups
19. A hand-painted ceramic vase
20. A decorative wall mirror with an elaborate frame
21. A set of colorful, patterned coasters
22. A hand-woven tapestry
23. A decorative candle holder
24. A bonsai tree

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
