Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Public sculptures in Rome created during the Baroque period that feature water elements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fontana del Tritone
2. Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi
3. Fontana della Barcaccia
4. Fontana di Trevi

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Pantheon
6. St. Peter's Basilica
7. Piazza Navona (the square itself)
8. Spanish Steps
9. Colosseum
10. Borghese Gallery and Gardens (the gardens as a whole)
11. Castel Sant'Angelo
12. Fontana delle Tartarughe (Renaissance period)
13. Palazzo Farnese
14. The Tiber River
15. Fontana dell'Acqua Felice (mostly Renaissance, some Baroque elements)
16. Villa d'Este (Tivoli, not Rome)
17. Apollo and Daphne sculpture (Borghese Gallery, no water element)
18. The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa (Cornaro Chapel, no water element)
19. Piazza del Popolo (the square itself)
20. San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (the church itself)
21. Fontana di Piazza Colonna (mostly 16th century)
22. The Rape of Proserpina sculpture (Borghese Gallery, no water element)
23. David by Bernini (Borghese Gallery, no water element)
24. Trevi district (the neighborhood surrounding the fountain)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
