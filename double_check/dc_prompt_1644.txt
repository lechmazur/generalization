Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that were originally designed as temporary solutions but became permanent due to widespread adoption and familiarity

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. QWERTY keyboard layout
2. Post-it Notes
3. Jeep vehicles
4. USB interface

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bluetooth technology
6. Electric cars
7. Smartphones
8. LED light bulbs
9. Wi-Fi networks
10. Streaming services
11. Online shopping
12. Hybrid cars
13. GPS navigation systems
14. Cloud storage
15. 3D printing
16. Voice-activated assistants
17. Electric scooters
18. Smart home devices
19. Video conferencing software
20. Social media platforms
21. Digital cameras
22. Online banking
23. Wearable fitness trackers
24. Virtual reality headsets

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
