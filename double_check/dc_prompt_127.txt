Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): inventions or concepts initially dismissed as impractical or impossible that were later realized and fundamentally transformed their field

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Helicopter
2. Personal computer
3. Electric light bulb
4. Wireless communication

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Steam engine
6. Printing press
7. Telephone
8. Automobile
9. Internet
10. Airplane
11. Radio
12. Television
13. Refrigerator
14. Microwave oven
15. Smartphone
16. GPS technology
17. Electric car
18. 3D printing
19. Blockchain
20. Artificial intelligence
21. Virtual reality
22. Solar panels
23. Quantum computing
24. Genetic engineering

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
