Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural practices that incorporate symbolic representations of ancestral spirits through performative art forms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a Balinese Barong dance featuring Rangda as a representation of ancestral spirits
2. a Yoruba Egungun masquerade honoring deceased ancestors through elaborate costumes and dance
3. a MƒÅori haka performance invoking ancestral warriors through rhythmic chants and movements
4. a Native American Ghost Dance ceremony symbolizing the return of ancestral spirits

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a Chinese New Year dragon dance
6. a Japanese tea ceremony
7. a Hindu Diwali festival of lights
8. a Mexican Day of the Dead altar
9. a Greek Orthodox Easter celebration
10. a Viking funeral ritual
11. a Catholic Mass with incense and hymns
12. a Buddhist meditation retreat
13. a Native American powwow dance
14. a Brazilian Carnival parade
15. a Korean ancestral memorial rite (Jesa)
16. a Hawaiian hula dance
17. a Tibetan sand mandala creation
18. a Roman gladiatorial combat reenactment
19. a Celtic Samhain bonfire ceremony
20. a Russian Orthodox icon procession
21. a Sufi whirling dervish performance
22. a West African drumming circle
23. a Native American sweat lodge ceremony
24. a Japanese Kabuki theater performance

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
