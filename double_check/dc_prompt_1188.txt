Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that rely on a finite resource whose depletion fundamentally alters their function or existence.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a disposable camera
2. a traditional film projector
3. a butane lighter
4. a single-use insulin pen

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a rechargeable battery
6. a solar-powered calculator
7. a wind-up watch
8. a refillable ink pen
9. a hybrid car
10. a compostable coffee pod
11. a refillable water bottle
12. a digital camera
13. a smartphone
14. a bicycle
15. a gas-powered lawnmower
16. a diesel truck
17. a coal-fired power plant
18. a nuclear reactor
19. a hydroelectric dam
20. a wind turbine
21. a geothermal heating system
22. a tidal energy generator
23. a biomass boiler
24. a hydrogen fuel cell

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
