Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Islands in the South Pacific that are popular tourist destinations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Bora Bora
2. Fiji
3. Cook Islands
4. Palau

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hawaii
6. Maldives
7. Bali
8. Santorini
9. Galapagos Islands
10. Whitsunday Islands
11. Tahiti
12. Samoa
13. Tonga
14. Vanuatu
15. Solomon Islands
16. New Caledonia
17. Easter Island
18. Phuket
19. Koh Samui
20. Borneo
21. Madagascar
22. Sri Lanka
23. Jamaica
24. Dominican Republic

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
