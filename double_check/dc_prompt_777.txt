Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena that result in the redistribution of water resources across different ecosystems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Glacial meltwater flowing into rivers and lakes
2. Floods causing water to spread from rivers to surrounding land areas
3. Groundwater recharge from precipitation seeping into aquifers
4. Water vapor transport through atmospheric rivers leading to precipitation in different regions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Water purification processes in treatment plants
6. Irrigation systems distributing water to agricultural fields
7. Water conservation techniques used in households
8. Desalination plants converting seawater to freshwater
9. Water storage in reservoirs for human use
10. Evaporation of water from lakes and oceans
11. Water recycling in industrial processes
12. Stormwater management systems in urban areas
13. Water usage in hydroelectric power generation
14. Water distribution through municipal pipelines
15. Water loss through transpiration in plants
16. Water diversion projects for human consumption
17. Water filtration through natural wetlands
18. Water extraction from wells for domestic use
19. Water flow in artificial canals
20. Water retention in soil for plant growth
21. Water movement in ocean currents
22. Water vapor condensation into clouds
23. Water usage in aquaculture systems
24. Water flow in man-made drainage systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
