Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geological features or formations that have been used as metaphors in user interface design patterns

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A mountain peak used to represent the highest level or achievement in a progress bar.
2. A canyon used to symbolize a deep dive into detailed settings or options in a menu.
3. A river used to illustrate the flow of data or information through a system.
4. A cave used to represent hidden or advanced features in a software application.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A tree used to represent a hierarchical structure in a file system.
6. A wave used to symbolize the ups and downs of stock market trends in a financial app.
7. A bridge used to represent a connection between two different parts of a network.
8. A storm used to indicate turbulent conditions in a weather forecasting application.
9. A road used to symbolize the journey or path through a tutorial or onboarding process.
10. A forest used to represent a collection of data or items in a database.
11. A lake used to symbolize a calm and serene state in a meditation app.
12. A volcano used to indicate a critical or urgent situation in a monitoring system.
13. A desert used to represent a lack of activity or data in a system.
14. A glacier used to symbolize slow but steady progress in a long-term project management tool.
15. A waterfall used to represent a cascading effect or sequence of actions in a workflow.
16. A cliff used to symbolize a point of no return or a critical decision in a decision-making tool.
17. A beach used to represent a relaxing or casual mode in a gaming application.
18. A swamp used to symbolize a complex and difficult-to-navigate situation in a problem-solving app.
19. A hill used to represent a minor challenge or obstacle in a fitness tracking app.
20. A plain used to symbolize simplicity and ease of use in a user interface design.
21. A valley used to represent a low point or a dip in performance metrics in a business analytics tool.
22. An island used to symbolize isolation or a standalone feature in a software suite.
23. A reef used to represent a barrier or obstacle in a project management application.
24. A tundra used to symbolize a cold and harsh environment in a survival game.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
