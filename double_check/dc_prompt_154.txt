Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific instruments or devices that were first developed to study microscopic organisms but later found major applications in other fields

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Electron microscope
2. Petri dish
3. Microtome
4. Flow cytometer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Thermometer
6. Barometer
7. Seismograph
8. Stethoscope
9. Geiger counter
10. Hygrometer
11. Altimeter
12. Sonar
13. Radar
14. Voltmeter
15. Oscilloscope
16. Thermal camera
17. Mass spectrometer
18. GPS device
19. Accelerometer
20. Bar code scanner
21. Infrared thermometer
22. Weather balloon
23. Magnetometer
24. Ultrasound machine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
