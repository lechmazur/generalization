Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or structures that appear chaotic or random at first glance but are governed by a precise, underlying mathematical or geometric principle

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. snowflakes
2. nautilus shells
3. tree branching patterns
4. honeycomb structures

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. sand dunes
6. cloud formations
7. lightning bolts
8. rock formations
9. paint splatters
10. ink blots
11. spider webs
12. coral reefs
13. leaf patterns
14. wave patterns
15. mountain ranges
16. river deltas
17. crystal formations
18. foam bubbles
19. bark textures
20. wind patterns
21. erosion patterns
22. moss growth
23. lichen patterns
24. water ripples

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
