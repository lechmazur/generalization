Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): European rivers that flow into the Mediterranean Sea and are named after a city or region they pass through

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Rhone
2. Po
3. Ebro
4. Arno

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Danube
6. Seine
7. Thames
8. Loire
9. Elbe
10. Tagus
11. Volga
12. Rhine
13. Oder
14. Vistula
15. Dnieper
16. Garonne
17. Tiber
18. Shannon
19. Douro
20. Guadalquivir
21. Marne
22. Meuse
23. Severn
24. Yenisei

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
