Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical systems or structures that store information by encoding it as microscopic state changes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hard disk drive platters
2. Flash memory cells
3. Phase-change memory
4. Magnetic tape data storage

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Library card catalog
6. Cloud storage services
7. Encyclopedia volumes
8. USB flash drives
9. CD-ROMs
10. DVDs
11. Blu-ray discs
12. External hard drives
13. SD cards
14. Database management systems
15. File cabinets
16. Paper documents
17. Books
18. Microfilm
19. Server racks
20. Data centers
21. Online backups
22. Email servers
23. Spreadsheets
24. Text files

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
