Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or systems designed to detect and neutralize threats that are too small to be seen with the naked eye

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Air purifier with HEPA filter
2. Antivirus software
3. Water purification system with UV sterilization
4. Automated malware analysis sandbox

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Telescope
6. Microscope
7. Metal detector
8. Radar system
9. Surveillance camera
10. Fingerprint scanner
11. Facial recognition software
12. Bomb squad robot
13. Airport security scanner
14. Guard dog
15. Motion sensor
16. Smoke detector
17. Carbon monoxide detector
18. Sprinkler system
19. Fire extinguisher
20. Security guard
21. Fenced perimeter
22. Locked door
23. Anti-tank missile
24. Fighter jet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
