Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures primarily composed of calcium carbonate plates or scales, produced biologically by a single-celled organism.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Coccolithophore
2. Emiliania huxleyi
3. Calcareous nannofossil
4. Gephyrocapsa oceanica

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Coral reef
6. Snail shell
7. Clam shell
8. Oyster shell
9. Sea urchin test
10. Chalk
11. Limestone
12. Foraminifera
13. Crab exoskeleton
14. Eggshell
15. Bone
16. Stalactite
17. Stalagmite
18. Calcium carbonate rock
19. Sea shell
20. Sand dollar
21. Coralline algae
22. Chiton shell
23. Scallop shell
24. Ammonite fossil

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
