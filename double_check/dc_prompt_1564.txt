Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural elements or design patterns that were originally created to solve structural problems but became primarily decorative features in later styles

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Crenelations (battlements)
2. Blind arcading
3. Keystone
4. Buttresses

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gargoyles
6. Acropolis
7. Oculus
8. Caryatids
9. Fluting (on columns)
10. Molding
11. Stained glass
12. Rose window
13. Pendentive
14. Minaret
15. Flying buttress
16. Groin vault
17. Dome
18. Arch
19. Column
20. Entablature
21. Pediment
22. Cornice
23. Frieze
24. Portico

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
