Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects or locations that collect and hold blue-tinted water while serving as community gathering places

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Trevi Fountain
2. Bellagio Lake
3. Marina Bay
4. Centennial Olympic Park Fountain

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lake Michigan
6. swimming pool
7. town square
8. public park
9. community center
10. shopping mall
11. water tower
12. reservoir
13. beach
14. botanical garden
15. fish pond
16. water park
17. amphitheater
18. city hall plaza
19. river walk
20. courtyard
21. reflecting pool
22. harbor
23. public library
24. sports stadium

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
