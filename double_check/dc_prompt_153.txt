Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Prehistoric creatures whose fossils were first discovered in locations that later became popular tourist destinations due to local folklore about magical or supernatural phenomena

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Megalosaurus
2. Ichthyosaurus
3. Plesiosaurus
4. Dimorphodon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Tyrannosaurus rex
6. Triceratops
7. Stegosaurus
8. Velociraptor
9. Brachiosaurus
10. Diplodocus
11. Allosaurus
12. Spinosaurus
13. Archaeopteryx
14. Coelophysis
15. Parasaurolophus
16. Gallimimus
17. Therizinosaurus
18. Oviraptor
19. Edmontosaurus
20. Giganotosaurus
21. Quetzalcoatlus
22. Microraptor
23. Styracosaurus
24. Maiasaura

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
