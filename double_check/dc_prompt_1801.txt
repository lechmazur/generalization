Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to evoke both happiness and sorrow simultaneously through visual or auditory cues

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a music box playing a nostalgic lullaby
2. a painting of a sunset over a battlefield
3. a sculpture of a smiling face with tears
4. a film scene with a joyful reunion in a graveyard

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a brightly colored beach ball
6. a cheerful birthday card
7. a sad song played in a minor key
8. a comedy movie poster
9. a black and white photograph of a stormy sea
10. a motivational poster with a sunrise
11. a horror movie soundtrack
12. a vibrant abstract painting
13. a children's book with a happy ending
14. a dramatic opera performance
15. a colorful festival parade
16. a romantic comedy film
17. a serene landscape painting
18. a suspenseful thriller novel
19. a lively jazz concert
20. a historical documentary
21. a cheerful pop song
22. a vibrant cityscape photograph
23. a classic rock album cover
24. a peaceful nature sound recording

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
