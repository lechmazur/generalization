Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artworks or natural phenomena that visually or conceptually juxtapose organic and geometric forms in a way that creates a sense of surreal or unexpected harmony

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Salvador Dal√≠'s painting "Swans Reflecting Elephants"
2. The rock formations at Bryce Canyon National Park
3. The sculptures of Isamu Noguchi, such as "The Black Sun"
4. The patterns created by frost on a windowpane

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of a city skyline
6. A photograph of a forest
7. A sculpture of a human figure
8. A geometric abstract painting
9. A landscape with rolling hills
10. A still life of fruit in a bowl
11. A portrait of a person
12. A photograph of a mountain range
13. A painting of a stormy sea
14. A sculpture of an animal
15. A photograph of a flower
16. An abstract painting with organic shapes
17. A geometric pattern on a piece of fabric
18. A painting of a sunset
19. A sculpture made entirely of straight lines
20. A photograph of a river
21. A painting of a busy street scene
22. A sculpture of a building
23. A photograph of a desert
24. An abstract painting with only curved lines

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
