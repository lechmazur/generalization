Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or systems that translate biological signals from one species into meaningful stimuli for a different species

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A device that converts bee dance movements into audio signals for humans
2. An interface that translates dolphin echolocation patterns into visual displays for human observers
3. A system that converts human speech into appropriate frequency ultrasonic signals for dogs
4. A collar that transforms cat purring vibrations into light patterns visible to birds

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A hearing aid
6. A dog whistle
7. An EEG machine
8. A heart rate monitor
9. Sign language translator gloves
10. A voice recorder
11. An electrocardiogram
12. A motion sensor camera
13. A bat detector
14. A seismograph
15. A microphone
16. A thermal imaging camera
17. An ultrasound machine
18. A speech synthesizer
19. A brainwave reader
20. A lie detector
21. A pressure sensor mat
22. A radio collar
23. A pH meter
24. A blood glucose monitor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
