Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations named after natural elements that are also associated with significant scientific discoveries or theories.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Wilson Observatory
2. Green Bank Telescope
3. Mauna Kea Observatories
4. Lake Baikal Neutrino Telescope

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Yellowstone National Park
6. Niagara Falls
7. Grand Canyon
8. Amazon Rainforest
9. Great Barrier Reef
10. Mount Everest
11. Dead Sea
12. Victoria Falls
13. Iguazu Falls
14. Mount Kilimanjaro
15. Gal√°pagos Islands
16. Serengeti National Park
17. Antarctica
18. Sahara Desert
19. Rocky Mountains
20. Great Smoky Mountains
21. Yosemite National Park
22. Patagonia
23. Mojave Desert
24. Arctic Circle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
