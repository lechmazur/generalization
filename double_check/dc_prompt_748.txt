Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or objects that exhibit a logarithmic spiral pattern in their structure or growth.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Nautilus shell
2. Sunflower seed head
3. Spiral galaxy
4. Hurricane

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Fern leaf
6. Pine cone
7. Snail shell (some species)
8. Romanesco broccoli
9. Tree rings
10. Spider web
11. River meander
12. Animal horn
13. Crystal structure (some)
14. DNA double helix
15. Vortex
16. Seashell (general)
17. Flower petal arrangement (some)
18. Lightning bolt
19. Tornado
20. Whirlpool
21. Fibonacci sequence
22. Golden ratio
23. Fractal patterns
24. Wave pattern

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
