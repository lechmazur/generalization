Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that alternate between states of rapid movement and stillness, often in a cyclical or repetitive manner.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. windshield wipers
2. metronome
3. piston engine
4. grandfather clock pendulum

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. revolving door
6. ceiling fan
7. treadmill
8. conveyor belt
9. escalator
10. bicycle wheel
11. merry-go-round
12. electric mixer
13. washing machine
14. blender
15. water wheel
16. propeller
17. drill
18. record player
19. hamster wheel
20. spinning top
21. turbine
22. sewing machine
23. potter's wheel
24. carousel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
