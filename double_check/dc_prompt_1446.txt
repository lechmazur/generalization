Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artificial lakes in European royal gardens that were designed to reflect architectural features and create optical illusions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Grand Canal at the Palace of Versailles, France
2. The Neptune Fountain at the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, Spain
3. The Mirror Lake at Schönbrunn Palace, Austria
4. The Water Parterre at Herrenhausen Gardens, Germany

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Serpentine in Hyde Park, London
6. The Lake at Blenheim Palace, England
7. The Round Pond in Kensington Gardens, London
8. The Lake at Kew Gardens, London
9. The Lake at Stourhead, England
10. The Lake at Chatsworth House, England
11. The Lake at Castle Howard, England
12. The Lake at Powerscourt Estate, Ireland
13. The Lake at Villa d'Este, Italy
14. The Lake at Villa Lante, Italy
15. The Lake at Peterhof Palace, Russia
16. The Lake at Drottningholm Palace, Sweden
17. The Lake at Frederiksborg Castle, Denmark
18. The Lake at Het Loo Palace, Netherlands
19. The Lake at Amalienborg Palace, Denmark
20. The Lake at Neuschwanstein Castle, Germany
21. The Lake at Montjuïc Park, Spain
22. The Lake at Parc de la Tête d'Or, France
23. The Lake at Tivoli Gardens, Denmark
24. The Lake at Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, France

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
