Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in tabletop games that have a circular shape and are made of plastic or metal.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a poker chip
2. a game token from Monopoly
3. a metal coin used in Dungeons & Dragons
4. a plastic spinner from a board game

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a chess piece
6. a dice
7. a playing card
8. a game board
9. a figurine
10. a domino tile
11. a jigsaw puzzle piece
12. a score pad
13. a sand timer
14. a rulebook
15. a card sleeve
16. a game box
17. a miniature terrain piece
18. a character sheet
19. a dice tray
20. a game mat
21. a token bag
22. a card holder
23. a game timer
24. a game organizer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
