Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional hunting tools used by indigenous Arctic peoples for marine mammals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Toggle harpoon
2. Drag float
3. Ice pick
4. Seal skin float

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bow and arrow
6. Atlatl
7. Boomerang
8. Blowgun
9. Fishing net
10. Fish hook
11. Spear
12. Snare
13. Deadfall trap
14. Pit trap
15. Knife
16. Axe
17. Rifle
18. Kayak
19. Umiak
20. Snowshoes
21. Dog sled
22. Harpoon gun
23. Fishing spear
24. Club

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
