Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures or natural formations that are shaped or influenced by wind patterns over time.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Antelope Canyon
2. The Great Victoria Desert's dune fields
3. The White Desert's wind-sculpted chalk formations
4. The Barchan dunes of the Gobi Desert

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Grand Canyon
6. Stalactites in caves
7. The Eiffel Tower
8. The Great Wall of China
9. Coral reefs
10. The Pyramids of Giza
11. Glaciers
12. The Statue of Liberty
13. The Amazon Rainforest
14. The Sydney Opera House
15. The Mariana Trench
16. The Colosseum in Rome
17. The Rocky Mountains
18. The Taj Mahal
19. The Nile River
20. The Golden Gate Bridge
21. The Great Barrier Reef
22. The Burj Khalifa
23. The Yellowstone National Park
24. The Leaning Tower of Pisa

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
