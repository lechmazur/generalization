Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that are commonly found in kitchens and have been used as improvised tools for non-cooking purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a rolling pin used to flatten dough for crafts
2. a whisk repurposed as a bubble wand
3. a colander used as a makeshift helmet for a costume
4. a spatula used to scrape ice off a car windshield

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a frying pan
6. a blender
7. a cutting board
8. a toaster
9. a coffee mug
10. a refrigerator
11. a dishwasher
12. a microwave
13. a kettle
14. a mixing bowl
15. a ladle
16. a cheese grater
17. a measuring cup
18. a kitchen timer
19. a pot holder
20. a can opener
21. a garlic press
22. a salad spinner
23. a baking sheet
24. a meat thermometer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
