Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that involve a statistically significant deviation from an expected cyclical pattern measured over at least one full cycle.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A stock market index experiencing a sustained bull market lasting significantly longer than previous bull markets based on historical data.
2. A region's rainfall patterns showing a multi-year drought significantly exceeding the typical drought cycle length and severity observed over the past century.
3. A pendulum clock consistently running faster than expected over multiple days, deviating from its established oscillatory period.
4. A population of migratory birds altering their migration patterns, arriving significantly earlier or later than the historical average over several migration seasons.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A coin landing on heads five times in a row.
6. A basketball player having an unusually high-scoring game.
7. A sudden spike in website traffic due to a viral social media post.
8. A company's quarterly earnings exceeding analysts' expectations.
9. A car breaking down unexpectedly.
10. A student getting a perfect score on a test.
11. A sudden drop in temperature during a heatwave.
12. A lottery winner.
13. A hurricane hitting a coastal region.
14. A volcanic eruption.
15. An earthquake.
16. A solar flare.
17. A change in government policy.
18. A new technological innovation.
19. A shift in consumer preferences.
20. A company merger.
21. A celebrity scandal.
22. A sporting event upset.
23. A scientific discovery.
24. A work of art becoming popular.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
