Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): natural or human-made underground spaces that have been repurposed for agricultural, cultural, or ritualistic use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Paris Catacombs, initially quarries, now house ossuaries and occasionally art installations.
2. A salt mine in Poland, transformed into a chapel and health spa.
3. Cappadocia's cave churches and dwellings, carved from volcanic rock and used for centuries.
4. A former limestone mine in the Netherlands, now used to cultivate mushrooms and host events.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A greenhouse built on the surface.
6. An abandoned subway station used for storage.
7. A natural cave used for scientific research.
8. A basement converted into a living space.
9. A buried time capsule.
10. An underwater research facility.
11. A treehouse built high in the branches.
12. A purpose-built underground bunker for survival.
13. A tunnel used for transportation.
14. A natural hot spring used for bathing.
15. A man-made lake used for recreation.
16. A landfill site for waste disposal.
17. A skyscraper with multiple floors.
18. A desert oasis used as a resting place.
19. An open-pit mine for mineral extraction.
20. A mountaintop monastery.
21. A floating village on a lake.
22. A space station orbiting Earth.
23. A data center built inside a mountain.
24. A natural sinkhole used for geological study.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
