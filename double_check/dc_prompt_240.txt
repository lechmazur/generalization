Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Small, autonomous devices inspired by nature that perform specific tasks

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a robotic bee that pollinates flowers
2. a tiny crab-like robot that cleans ocean floors
3. a bird-inspired drone that monitors forests
4. a fish-shaped device that collects water quality data

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a self-driving car
6. a smart thermostat
7. a robotic vacuum cleaner
8. a drone for aerial photography
9. a wearable fitness tracker
10. a home security camera
11. a voice-activated assistant
12. a 3D printer
13. a robotic arm in a factory
14. a smart refrigerator
15. a solar-powered streetlight
16. a GPS navigation system
17. a virtual reality headset
18. a smartwatch
19. a drone for package delivery
20. a robotic lawn mower
21. a smart doorbell
22. a portable air purifier
23. a robotic pet
24. a smart light bulb

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
