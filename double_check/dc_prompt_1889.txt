Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical sites associated with significant human tragedies in the 18th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Île de Ré, departure point for thousands of Huguenots exiled after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes
2. Fort William Henry, site of a massacre following its surrender during the French and Indian War
3. Lisbon, devastated by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 1755
4. The Wexford Bridge, scene of a brutal massacre during the 1798 Irish Rebellion

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Palace of Versailles
6. The Tower of London
7. Independence Hall
8. The Colosseum
9. The Great Pyramid of Giza
10. Chichén Itzá
11. Machu Picchu
12. The Taj Mahal
13. The Forbidden City
14. Angkor Wat
15. Gettysburg
16. Auschwitz
17. Hiroshima
18. The Killing Fields
19. Ground Zero
20. The Alamo
21. Little Bighorn Battlefield
22. The site of the Boston Massacre
23. Ford's Theatre
24. The Bastille

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
