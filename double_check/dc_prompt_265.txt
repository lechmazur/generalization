Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools used by notable female artists to create significant works in the 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a camera obscura
2. a palette knife
3. a potter's wheel
4. a silkscreen frame

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a paintbrush
6. a chisel
7. a sewing machine
8. a typewriter
9. a violin
10. a microscope
11. a telescope
12. a drafting table
13. a loom
14. a kiln
15. a printing press
16. a welding torch
17. a computer
18. a sketchbook
19. a musical score
20. a sculpting stand
21. a darkroom enlarger
22. a calligraphy pen
23. a pottery kiln
24. a canvas stretcher

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
