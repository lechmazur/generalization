Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural or scientific phenomena that emerged as a result of specific historical or technological breakthroughs and are now celebrated or studied globally despite their localized origins.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Renaissance art technique of linear perspective, first developed in Florence
2. The discovery of penicillin from mold in a London laboratory
3. The Gutenberg printing press innovation in Mainz
4. The development of gunpowder in ancient China

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Wall of China
6. Egyptian hieroglyphs
7. Roman numerals
8. Greek philosophy
9. The compass
10. Democracy
11. The wheel
12. Agriculture
13. Writing systems
14. Mathematics
15. Pottery making
16. Metallurgy
17. Cave paintings
18. Sailing
19. Calendar systems
20. Musical instruments
21. Weaving
22. Glass making
23. Astronomy
24. Architecture

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
