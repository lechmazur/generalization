Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): mechanical devices used in the 20th century for routing and switching electrical signals in communication networks

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Strowger switch
2. Crossbar switch
3. Rotary dial telephone
4. Step-by-step switch

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Fiber optic cable
6. Transistor
7. Satellite dish
8. Smartphone
9. Digital router
10. Ethernet cable
11. Wi-Fi router
12. Bluetooth device
13. LED display
14. Microprocessor
15. Laser printer
16. Modem
17. Television remote
18. Photocopier
19. Smartwatch
20. Internet protocol
21. Touchscreen
22. Digital camera
23. Video game console
24. Smart speaker

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
