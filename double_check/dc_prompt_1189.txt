Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or structures that combine organic growth patterns with human-made functionality, where natural elements are intentionally integrated into their design or purpose

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Biophilic architecture that incorporates living walls into office buildings to enhance air quality and employee well-being
2. A bicycle designed with a frame made from bamboo, utilizing the plant's natural strength and flexibility
3. A water filtration system that uses bioengineered moss to purify water, integrating the plant's natural filtration properties
4. A public park bench that incorporates mycelium-based materials for its structure, promoting sustainability and natural decomposition

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A skyscraper with a rooftop garden
6. A wooden bridge in a national park
7. A car with a biofuel engine
8. A solar panel integrated into a building's facade
9. A sculpture made from recycled materials
10. A greenhouse used for growing vegetables
11. A wind turbine in a rural area
12. A rain garden designed to manage stormwater
13. A composting toilet system
14. A hiking trail through a forest
15. A dam built to generate hydroelectric power
16. A community garden in an urban area
17. A house with energy-efficient windows
18. A park with native plant species
19. A bicycle path along a river
20. A building with a green roof
21. A water fountain in a public square
22. A playground with natural elements like logs and boulders
23. A bus powered by electricity
24. A pedestrian bridge with artistic lighting

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
