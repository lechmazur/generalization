Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Words or phrases that juxtapose a sense of tranquility with an element of contradiction or tension

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Silent storm
2. Peaceful chaos
3. Calm fury
4. Tranquil unrest

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Serene landscape
6. Loud silence
7. Quiet morning
8. Boiling point
9. Still water
10. Restless night
11. Soft thunder
12. Harsh whisper
13. Gentle roar
14. Calm sea
15. Turbulent peace
16. Quiet riot
17. Soothing scream
18. Relaxing tension
19. Peaceful protest
20. Silent argument
21. Tranquil breeze
22. Calm before the storm
23. Quiet explosion
24. Soft impact

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
