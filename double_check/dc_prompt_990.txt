Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that represent a fusion of historical significance and mathematical symmetry, where each element embodies a transformative shift in its respective field.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Antikythera mechanism
2. The Fibonacci spiral
3. The Platonic solids
4. The Golden Rectangle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Rosetta Stone
6. The abacus
7. The compass
8. The sundial
9. The pyramids
10. Pascal's triangle
11. The astrolabe
12. The printing press
13. The wheel
14. The pendulum
15. The telescope
16. The double helix
17. The periodic table
18. The binary system
19. The steam engine
20. The microscope
21. The Roman arch
22. The calendar
23. The number zero
24. The magnetic compass

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
