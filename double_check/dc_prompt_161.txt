Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Enclosed spaces designed for temporary human occupancy that use heat or steam as a primary element of their intended function

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A sauna
2. A steam room
3. A hot yoga studio
4. A sweat lodge

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A greenhouse
6. A kitchen
7. A bedroom
8. A car
9. A tent
10. A movie theater
11. A gym
12. A swimming pool
13. A bathroom
14. A conference room
15. A restaurant
16. A bus
17. A classroom
18. A waiting room
19. A locker room
20. A spa
21. A hotel room
22. An elevator
23. A subway car
24. A library

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
