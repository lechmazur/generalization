Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical events or objects that significantly influenced the development of timekeeping systems or concepts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The invention of the water clock in ancient Egypt
2. The Harrison H4 marine chronometer
3. The discovery of quartz crystal oscillation properties
4. The first mechanical tower clock in Milan's Church of St. Eustorgio

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The French Revolution calendar
6. The Mayan Long Count calendar
7. Greenwich Observatory
8. The first wristwatch
9. The Roman calendar
10. The invention of the hourglass
11. The first digital watch
12. The Chinese zodiac system
13. The first alarm clock patent
14. The sundial
15. The atomic clock
16. The mechanical pocket watch
17. The Julian calendar reform
18. The first railway timetables
19. The invention of the pendulum
20. The first electric clock
21. The Egyptian calendar
22. The Byzantine time system
23. The first chronograph
24. The International Date Line establishment

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
