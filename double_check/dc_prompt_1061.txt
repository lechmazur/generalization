Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or artificial structures that have been repurposed or reclaimed by nature, resulting in a symbiotic relationship where the original function is obscured or transformed by organic growth.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. An abandoned railway bridge covered in flowering vines and moss, with trees growing through its tracks
2. A sunken ship that has become an artificial reef teeming with coral and marine life
3. A derelict greenhouse whose broken glass panels now support climbing plants and house wild birds
4. An old stone wall that has become integrated into a living hedge with roots growing through its cracks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern green roof on a building
6. A carefully maintained historic ruins
7. A decorative garden trellis
8. A public park built on former industrial land
9. A vertical garden on a skyscraper
10. A bird's nest on a telephone pole
11. A planned wildlife corridor
12. An artificial pond
13. A deliberately placed artificial reef
14. A landscaped median strip
15. A living wall installation
16. A rooftop vegetable garden
17. A preserved ancient ruin
18. A butterfly garden
19. A constructed wetland
20. An eco-bridge over a highway
21. A terraced hillside
22. A maintained historic garden
23. A designed wildlife habitat
24. A planted highway sound barrier

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
