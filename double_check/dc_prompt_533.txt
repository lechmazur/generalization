Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices that utilize a ratcheting mechanism to create intermittent, unidirectional motion.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ratchet wrench
2. bicycle freewheel
3. zip tie
4. clock escapement

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. gearbox
6. pulley system
7. hydraulic press
8. electric motor
9. ball bearing
10. conveyor belt
11. wind turbine
12. crankshaft
13. piston engine
14. chain drive
15. camshaft
16. centrifugal pump
17. linear actuator
18. hydraulic cylinder
19. flywheel
20. turbofan engine
21. roller coaster
22. escalator
23. windlass
24. treadmill

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
