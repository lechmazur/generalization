Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed by artists that incorporate natural elements and serve as spaces for personal reflection or meditation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. James Turrell's Skyspace at Rice University
2. Noguchi's California Scenario garden
3. Andy Goldsworthy's Stone River at Stanford
4. Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Central Park in New York
6. A traditional Japanese rock garden
7. The Taj Mahal gardens
8. A church altar
9. A Buddhist temple
10. A public park bench
11. A natural hot spring
12. A meditation cushion
13. A prayer room
14. A forest clearing
15. A mountain lookout point
16. A beach cabana
17. A monastery courtyard
18. A yoga studio
19. A botanical garden
20. A private garden shed
21. A waterfall viewing platform
22. A meditation labyrinth
23. A sacred grove
24. A zen garden rake

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
