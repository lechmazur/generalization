Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or tools that combine organic or natural motifs with functional or technological purposes, where the design explicitly references a specific animal or plant form.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a lamp shaped like a blooming flower with LED petals
2. a chair designed to resemble a curled-up leaf with ergonomic support
3. a water bottle shaped like a cactus with built-in temperature control
4. a desk organizer modeled after a tree trunk with branching compartments

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wooden spoon
6. a ceramic vase
7. a leather-bound notebook
8. a bamboo cutting board
9. a stone paperweight
10. a glass terrarium
11. a metal wind chime
12. a woven basket
13. a cork bulletin board
14. a seashell necklace
15. a feather quill pen
16. a wooden rocking chair
17. a clay pot
18. a hemp rope
19. a beeswax candle
20. a wool sweater
21. a jute rug
22. a pinecone wreath
23. a driftwood sculpture
24. a coconut bowl

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
