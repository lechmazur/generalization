Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geological formations or features that were directly observed being created from start to finish by humans during recorded history

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Aral Sea's retreat and formation of the Aralkum Desert
2. The creation of Lake Nasser behind the Aswan High Dam
3. The formation of the Crater Lake in Mount St. Helens after its 1980 eruption
4. The emergence of Surtsey Island off the coast of Iceland in 1963

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Grand Canyon
6. The formation of the Himalayas
7. The creation of the Great Barrier Reef
8. The development of the Mississippi River Delta
9. The formation of the Hawaiian Islands
10. The creation of the Mariana Trench
11. The emergence of the Gal√°pagos Islands
12. The formation of the Dead Sea
13. The creation of the Amazon Rainforest
14. The development of the Sahara Desert
15. The formation of the Rocky Mountains
16. The creation of the Great Victoria Desert
17. The emergence of the Azores
18. The formation of the Andes
19. The creation of the Great Lakes
20. The development of the Gobi Desert
21. The formation of the Alps
22. The creation of the Kalahari Desert
23. The emergence of the Canary Islands
24. The formation of the Appalachian Mountains

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
