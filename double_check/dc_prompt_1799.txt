Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places where specific types of remains are intentionally gathered and preserved for cultural or scientific purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Seed bank
2. Museum of Jurassic Technology
3. Body farm
4. Ossuary

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Natural history museum
6. Art museum
7. Library
8. Archive
9. Graveyard
10. Cemetery
11. Mausoleum
12. Crypt
13. Battlefield
14. Shipwreck
15. Fossil dig site
16. Amber mine
17. Zoo
18. Aquarium
19. Botanical garden
20. Herbarium
21. Taxidermy collection
22. Insect collection
23. Stamp collection
24. Coin collection

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
