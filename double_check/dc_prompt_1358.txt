Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific instruments or tools that were specifically designed to analyze evidence from the distant past

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mass spectrometer for radiocarbon dating
2. X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for analyzing the elemental composition of ancient artifacts
3. Scanning electron microscope for examining the microstructure of fossilized materials
4. Dendrochronometer for precisely measuring tree ring widths to establish chronologies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Telescope
6. Microscope
7. Thermometer
8. Spectroscope
9. Seismograph
10. Magnifying glass
11. Camera
12. GPS receiver
13. Sonar
14. Radar
15. Computer
16. Software for 3D modeling
17. Ground-penetrating radar
18. Magnetometer
19. Trowel
20. Brush
21. Pickaxe
22. Satellite imagery
23. DNA sequencer
24. Historical records

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
