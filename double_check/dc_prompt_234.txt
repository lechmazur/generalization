Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): ancient religious practices involving animal sacrifices performed outdoors

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Aztec ritual of sacrificing animals to the gods at the top of pyramids
2. The ancient Greek practice of offering animals to deities at outdoor altars
3. The Norse tradition of animal sacrifices during outdoor bl√≥ts
4. The Vedic rituals involving animal offerings in open-air ceremonies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern indoor church service
6. A Buddhist meditation session
7. A Native American rain dance
8. A Hindu temple ceremony involving flowers
9. A Christian baptism in a river
10. A Jewish Passover Seder
11. A Muslim Eid al-Fitr celebration
12. A Shinto shrine visit
13. A Taoist festival with lanterns
14. A Sikh langar meal
15. A Wiccan solstice gathering
16. A Zoroastrian fire temple ritual
17. A Jain festival of Paryushana
18. A Rastafarian Nyabinghi drumming session
19. A Confucian ancestor worship ceremony
20. A Baha'i Naw-Ruz celebration
21. A Vodou ceremony involving drumming and dancing
22. A Celtic festival of Samhain
23. A Mayan ball game ritual
24. A Druidic tree worship ceremony

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
