Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional art forms that incorporate geometric patterns and are used in ceremonial contexts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Islamic tilework in mosques
2. Navajo sand paintings used in healing ceremonies
3. Celtic knotwork in illuminated manuscripts
4. Mud cloth (Bogolanfini) patterns in Malian rituals

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a stained glass window in a cathedral
6. a modern abstract painting
7. a quilt with floral patterns
8. a graffiti mural in an urban setting
9. a pottery vase with animal motifs
10. a tapestry depicting a historical battle
11. a calligraphy scroll with poetic verses
12. a sculpture of a human figure
13. a digital art piece with fractal designs
14. a wood carving of a tree
15. a mosaic depicting a mythological scene
16. a painted mask used in theater
17. a woven basket with zigzag patterns
18. a tattoo with tribal designs
19. a photograph of a landscape
20. a sketch of a city skyline
21. a ceramic plate with floral decorations
22. a mural depicting cultural traditions
23. a print of a famous painting
24. a sculpture of an abstract form

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
