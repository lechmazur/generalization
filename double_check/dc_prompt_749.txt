Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or practices historically used in rituals or ceremonies that involve water as a central element

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. aspergillum
2. lotus flower
3. conch shell
4. clay pitcher

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. prayer beads
6. incense burner
7. meditation cushion
8. prayer wheel
9. singing bowl
10. ceremonial drum
11. sage bundle
12. altar cloth
13. ritual dagger
14. crystal sphere
15. ceremonial mask
16. ritual bell
17. sacred text
18. offering plate
19. ritual staff
20. ceremonial robe
21. ritual candle
22. prayer flag
23. ritual sword
24. ceremonial headdress

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
