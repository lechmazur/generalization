Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Automated systems that collect and process data about natural disasters to predict future occurrences

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A system using satellite imagery and weather patterns to forecast hurricane landfalls.
2. A network of seismic sensors analyzing ground vibrations to predict earthquake aftershocks.
3. An AI model processing social media data and news reports to identify early signs of wildfires.
4. A platform integrating river level data and rainfall measurements to anticipate flood events.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weather app displaying current temperature and wind speed.
6. A seismograph recording ground motion.
7. A news report about a recent hurricane.
8. A social media post about a wildfire evacuation.
9. A database of historical flood events.
10. A scientist studying the effects of climate change.
11. A government agency providing disaster relief.
12. A software program simulating tsunami propagation.
13. A research paper on earthquake prediction methods.
14. A documentary about volcanic eruptions.
15. A website tracking asteroid trajectories.
16. A mobile app for reporting storm damage.
17. A sensor network monitoring air quality.
18. A computer model predicting landslide susceptibility.
19. A satellite measuring sea surface temperatures.
20. A buoy collecting ocean current data.
21. A weather balloon measuring atmospheric pressure.
22. A radar system tracking storm clouds.
23. A drone surveying a flood-affected area.
24. A geologist studying rock formations.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
