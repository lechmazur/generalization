Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional ceremonies involving the use of specific musical instruments to mark life events

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A didgeridoo played during an Aboriginal Australian coming-of-age ceremony.
2. Bagpipes played at a Scottish wedding.
3. A conch shell blown during a Hindu wedding ceremony.
4. A shofar blown during Rosh Hashanah.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A birthday party with a DJ.
6. A graduation ceremony with a brass band.
7. Singing hymns at a church service.
8. Clapping and cheering at a sporting event.
9. A funeral with a string quartet.
10. A rock concert.
11. Playing a piano at a cocktail party.
12. A flute solo in an orchestra performance.
13. Listening to music on headphones.
14. A violin concerto.
15. A child learning to play the recorder.
16. A group of friends singing karaoke.
17. A marching band in a parade.
18. A jazz ensemble playing in a club.
19. A choir singing at a Christmas concert.
20. Street musicians playing for tips.
21. A person playing the guitar by a campfire.
22. A DJ playing electronic music at a rave.
23. A music festival.
24. A lullaby sung to a baby.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
