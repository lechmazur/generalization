Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations named after geological formations that are also used as building materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Granite City
2. Marble Falls
3. Sandstone Point
4. Limestone Cove

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Iron Mountain
6. Silver Lake
7. Gold Coast
8. Crystal River
9. Coal Valley
10. Diamond Head
11. Emerald Isle
12. Jade Mountain
13. Ruby Hill
14. Obsidian Cliff
15. Quartz Hill
16. Slate Creek
17. Basalt Ridge
18. Flint River
19. Chalk Mountain
20. Shale Valley
21. Gypsum Canyon
22. Travertine Springs
23. Pumice Point
24. Gneiss Lake

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
