Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures incorporating naturally occurring geothermal hot springs as a central design element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Blue Lagoon Spa in Iceland
2. Thermae Bath Spa in Bath, England
3. Jigokudani Monkey Park in Japan
4. Tabacon Thermal Resort & Spa in Costa Rica

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Empire State Building
6. Burj Khalifa
7. Golden Gate Bridge
8. Great Wall of China
9. Colosseum in Rome
10. Petra in Jordan
11. Christ the Redeemer in Brazil
12. Stonehenge
13. Mount Rushmore
14. Hagia Sophia
15. Neuschwanstein Castle
16. Sydney Opera House
17. Statue of Liberty
18. Big Ben
19. Acropolis of Athens
20. Notre-Dame Cathedral
21. Leaning Tower of Pisa
22. Alhambra in Spain
23. Versailles Palace
24. Brandenburg Gate

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
