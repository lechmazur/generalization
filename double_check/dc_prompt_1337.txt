Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Surfaces or structures that exhibit both convex and concave curvature simultaneously, creating a saddle-like shape in three-dimensional space.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A hyperbolic paraboloid
2. The surface of a Pringles potato chip
3. A monkey saddle
4. The space between your thumb and index finger when pinching

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A sphere
6. A torus
7. A cube
8. A cylinder
9. A cone
10. A plane
11. A MÃ¶bius strip
12. A helix
13. A catenoid
14. A seashell
15. A saddle point on a graph
16. A valley between two mountains
17. The curve of a banana
18. A dome
19. A bowl
20. A spoon
21. A corrugated iron sheet
22. A Klein bottle
23. The surface of a liquid in a rotating bucket
24. A trefoil knot

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
