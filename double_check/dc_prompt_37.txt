Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures built primarily for astronomical observation that predate the invention of the telescope.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chichen Itza Observatory
2. Stonehenge
3. Big Horn Medicine Wheel
4. Thirteen Towers of Chankillo

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mount Wilson Observatory
6. Hubble Space Telescope
7. Pyramids of Giza
8. Parthenon
9. Pantheon
10. Aztec Sun Stone
11. Antikythera Mechanism
12. Greenwich Observatory
13. Machu Picchu
14. Very Large Array
15. Newgrange
16. Angkor Wat
17. Leaning Tower of Pisa
18. ALMA Observatory
19. Teotihuacan
20. Keck Observatory
21. GÃ¶bekli Tepe
22. Arecibo Observatory
23. Temple of Kukulcan
24. Paranal Observatory

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
