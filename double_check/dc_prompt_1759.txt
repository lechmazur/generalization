Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures built into natural landscapes to commemorate historical events or figures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Rushmore
2. Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial
3. Crazy Horse Memorial
4. Lincoln Memorial carved into the hillside

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Statue of Liberty
6. Eiffel Tower
7. Great Wall of China
8. Colosseum
9. Big Ben
10. Golden Gate Bridge
11. Christ the Redeemer
12. Empire State Building
13. Petra
14. Acropolis
15. Angkor Wat
16. Hagia Sophia
17. Neuschwanstein Castle
18. Burj Khalifa
19. Notre-Dame Cathedral
20. Leaning Tower of Pisa
21. St. Basil's Cathedral
22. Sydney Opera House
23. Brandenburg Gate
24. Alhambra

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
