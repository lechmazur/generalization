Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Protest movements that led to rule changes in professional sports leagues within 2 years of the initial protest

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The protest by NFL players kneeling during the national anthem, which led to changes in the league's policy on anthem conduct within two years.
2. The NBA players' protest in the 2020 playoffs, which resulted in the league agreeing to establish a social justice coalition and other initiatives within two years.
3. The WNBA players' protest in 2016 over racial injustice, which led to the league's increased support for social justice initiatives within two years.
4. The protest by MLB players in 2020, which led to the league committing to increased efforts in addressing racial inequality within two years.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The 1968 Olympics Black Power salute
6. The 1995 Rugby World Cup protest against apartheid
7. The 1980 Moscow Olympics boycott
8. The 1972 Munich Olympics protest
9. The 1964 Tokyo Olympics protest for South African inclusion
10. The 1992 Barcelona Olympics protest for Basque independence
11. The 2008 Beijing Olympics protest for Tibetan independence
12. The 2014 Sochi Olympics protest against anti-LGBT laws
13. The 2016 Rio Olympics protest against Brazilian government corruption
14. The 1976 Montreal Olympics protest over New Zealand's rugby tour of apartheid South Africa
15. The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics boycott by Eastern Bloc countries
16. The 1996 Atlanta Olympics protest for civil rights
17. The 2000 Sydney Olympics protest for Aboriginal rights
18. The 2012 London Olympics protest against corporate sponsorship
19. The 2018 Winter Olympics protest against North Korea's participation
20. The 2021 Tokyo Olympics protest against COVID-19 restrictions
21. The 1970s protests against the Vietnam War affecting sports events
22. The 1990s protests against Nike's labor practices
23. The 2000s protests against the Iraq War affecting sports events
24. The 2010s protests against climate change affecting sports events

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
