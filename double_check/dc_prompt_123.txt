Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): innovations or creations that combine functionality with aesthetic disruption, challenging conventional forms while serving a practical purpose

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a chair with asymmetrical legs and a seat that appears to float
2. a lamp that uses irregularly shaped glass panels to refract light unpredictably
3. a bookshelf designed as a chaotic, intertwined web of metal and wood
4. a clock with hands that move in non-linear patterns while still accurately telling time

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a traditional wooden rocking chair
6. a standard LED desk lamp
7. a rectangular metal bookshelf
8. a digital alarm clock
9. a minimalist glass coffee table
10. a plain white ceramic mug
11. a classic leather sofa
12. a conventional wall calendar
13. a basic wooden dining table
14. a standard office desk
15. a traditional chandelier
16. a simple woven basket
17. a standard kitchen blender
18. a plain metal coat rack
19. a typical plastic storage bin
20. a standard folding chair
21. a basic wall-mounted shelf
22. a conventional ceiling fan
23. a plain glass vase
24. a standard wooden picture frame

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
