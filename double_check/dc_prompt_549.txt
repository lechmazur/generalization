Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments designed for four-string bassists that utilize a specific configuration of two humbucker pickups and a single volume and tone control knob.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A bass guitar with a sleek body design, featuring two humbucker pickups and controlled by a single volume and tone knob.
2. A four-string bass with a unique finish, equipped with dual humbucker pickups and a streamlined control setup of one volume and one tone knob.
3. A bass instrument tailored for four-string players, boasting two humbucker pickups and simplified controls with a single volume and tone knob.
4. A professional-grade four-string bass, designed with two humbucker pickups and a minimalist control layout featuring one volume and one tone knob.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A five-string bass with two humbucker pickups and individual volume controls for each pickup.
6. A four-string bass with a single humbucker pickup and separate volume and tone controls.
7. A six-string bass guitar featuring three single-coil pickups and a five-way pickup selector switch.
8. A four-string bass with two humbucker pickups, a three-band equalizer, and separate volume and tone controls.
9. A bass guitar with a P-J pickup configuration and individual volume controls for each pickup.
10. A four-string bass with two humbucker pickups and a blend control instead of separate volume knobs.
11. A fretless four-string bass with two humbucker pickups and a three-way pickup selector switch.
12. A four-string bass with active electronics, two humbucker pickups, and a four-band equalizer.
13. A bass guitar with two humbucker pickups, a coil-split function, and separate volume and tone controls.
14. A four-string bass with two humbucker pickups and a master volume control but no tone control.
15. A bass guitar with a single humbucker pickup and a three-band equalizer.
16. A four-string bass with two humbucker pickups and a push-pull pot for coil splitting.
17. A bass guitar with two humbucker pickups, a blend control, and a three-band equalizer.
18. A four-string bass with two humbucker pickups and a five-way rotary pickup selector.
19. A bass guitar with two humbucker pickups and a master volume control but individual tone controls for each pickup.
20. A four-string bass with two humbucker pickups and a two-band equalizer.
21. A bass guitar with two humbucker pickups and a master tone control but individual volume controls for each pickup.
22. A four-string bass with two humbucker pickups and a phase switch.
23. A bass guitar with two humbucker pickups and a master volume control but no tone control.
24. A four-string bass with two humbucker pickups and a blend control but no tone control.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
