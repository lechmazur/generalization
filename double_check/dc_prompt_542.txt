Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative art or architectural elements that utilize naturally occurring tessellated patterns found in geological formations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A mosaic floor inspired by the Giant's Causeway basalt columns.
2. A ceramic tile backsplash mimicking the septarian concretions found in sedimentary rock.
3. A stained-glass window designed after the crystalline structure of amethyst geodes.
4. A carved stone fireplace mantel replicating the tessellated patterns of a dried mud bed.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Honeycomb pattern wallpaper
6. A quilt with a patchwork design
7. A brick wall in a running bond pattern
8. Fish scales
9. A chain-link fence
10. Spider web
11. A tiled bathroom floor
12. A parquet floor
13. A woven basket
14. A knitted sweater
15. A pineapple skin
16. A soccer ball
17. Graph paper
18. A circuit board
19. A stained-glass window with geometric patterns
20. A building facade with repeating window patterns
21. A cobblestone street
22. Dry stacked stone wall
23. A tortoiseshell pattern
24. A wood carving with geometric designs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
