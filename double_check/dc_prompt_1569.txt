Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Volcanic lakes formed in calderas above 800 meters elevation that are more than 2 kilometers wide

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lake Toba
2. Crater Lake
3. Lake Taupo
4. Lake Atitl√°n

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lake Victoria
6. Lake Titicaca
7. Lake Baikal
8. Lake Superior
9. Lake Geneva
10. Lake Como
11. Lake Michigan
12. Loch Ness
13. Lake Tahoe
14. Lake Erie
15. Lake Huron
16. Lake Ontario
17. Lake Malawi
18. Lake Tanganyika
19. Lake Chad
20. Lake Eyre
21. Lake Maracaibo
22. Lake Pontchartrain
23. Lake Mead
24. Lake Powell

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
