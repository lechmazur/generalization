Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or materials historically used in rituals or practices intended to protect against or communicate with supernatural entities, often incorporating precious metals or organic materials.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a silver amulet
2. a gold-plated talisman
3. a carved bone charm
4. a copper ritual dagger

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a silver necklace
6. a gold ring
7. a wooden sculpture
8. a bronze statue
9. a leather wallet
10. a silk scarf
11. a ceramic vase
12. a glass bottle
13. a plastic toy
14. a cotton shirt
15. a wool blanket
16. a steel knife
17. a rubber ball
18. a paper book
19. a linen tablecloth
20. a stone sculpture
21. a bamboo flute
22. a clay pot
23. a nylon rope
24. a polyester jacket

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
