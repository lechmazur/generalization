Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that integrate living organisms with mechanical components to maintain environmental conditions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A building facade with integrated algae bioreactors that regulate temperature and air quality.
2. A wastewater treatment system using microbial communities to break down pollutants and generate biogas.
3. A self-sustaining closed-loop greenhouse that utilizes plant transpiration and microbial processes for climate control and nutrient cycling.
4. A robotic arm with a bio-hybrid sensor array incorporating living cells to detect and respond to environmental changes.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A solar panel
6. A wind turbine
7. A geothermal power plant
8. A hydroponic garden
9. A smart thermostat
10. An air purifier
11. A water filter
12. A composting system
13. A weather station
14. A prosthetic limb
15. A pacemaker
16. A cochlear implant
17. A drone
18. A self-driving car
19. A robot vacuum cleaner
20. A 3D printer
21. Virtual reality headset
22. A genetically modified crop
23. A biofuel
24. A bionic eye

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
