Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or concepts that involve rotational symmetry and are used to represent or understand complex systems or phenomena.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Color wheel
2. Mandala
3. Unit circle in trigonometry
4. Cyclic group in abstract algebra

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Spiral galaxy
6. Benzene ring
7. Kaleidoscope pattern
8. Fibonacci spiral
9. Snowflake
10. Starfish
11. Flower petals
12. Pinwheel
13. DNA double helix
14. Hurricane
15. Wheel
16. Propeller
17. Clock face
18. Dartboard
19. Spider web
20. Gear
21. Compass rose
22. Zodiac chart
23. Tree rings
24. Ripple in water

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
