Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or philosophies that explicitly acknowledge and embrace multiple valid but seemingly contradictory viewpoints as part of their core framework

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Dialectical materialism
2. Quantum mechanics' wave-particle duality
3. Yin-Yang philosophy
4. Religious pluralism

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Utilitarianism
6. Existentialism
7. Stoicism
8. Capitalism
9. Socialism
10. Absolutism
11. Relativism
12. Empiricism
13. Rationalism
14. Dualism
15. Monism
16. Pragmatism
17. Nihilism
18. Humanism
19. Determinism
20. Libertarianism
21. Fascism
22. Communism
23. Anarchism
24. Postmodernism

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
