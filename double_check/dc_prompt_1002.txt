Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or technologies that utilize modular design principles to enable scalability, adaptability, or interchangeability of components while maintaining a unified functional purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a modular smartphone with swappable camera, battery, and display components
2. a prefabricated building system with interchangeable wall and floor panels
3. a modular robotics kit with customizable limbs and sensors
4. a modular synthesizer with detachable sound modules and control interfaces

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a monolithic skyscraper
6. a fixed-function calculator
7. a traditional wristwatch
8. a single-use disposable camera
9. a non-upgradable desktop computer
10. a static sculpture
11. a rigid steel beam
12. a sealed lithium-ion battery
13. a one-piece wooden chair
14. a fixed-gear bicycle
15. a monolithic concrete block
16. a non-customizable software application
17. a single-function kitchen appliance
18. a static printed circuit board
19. a non-modular video game console
20. a rigid plastic toy
21. a fixed-layout printed book
22. a non-interchangeable car engine
23. a static LED light fixture
24. a single-purpose medical device

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
