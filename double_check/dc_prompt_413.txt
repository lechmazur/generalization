Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize a central conductor surrounded by a dielectric material, then a conductive shield, and finally an outer insulating layer, designed for high-frequency signal transmission with minimal interference.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. RG-6 coaxial cable
2. RG-59 coaxial cable
3. LMR-400 coaxial cable
4. RG-11 coaxial cable

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. fiber optic cable
6. twisted pair cable
7. USB cable
8. HDMI cable
9. Ethernet cable
10. power cable
11. speaker wire
12. ribbon cable
13. lightning cable
14. VGA cable
15. RCA cable
16. optical audio cable
17. serial cable
18. parallel cable
19. telephone cable
20. micro USB cable
21. DisplayPort cable
22. Thunderbolt cable
23. banana plug cable
24. extension cord

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
