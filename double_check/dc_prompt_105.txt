Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or scientific expressions that utilize patterns of repetition and variation to create meaning or reveal hidden structures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A musical fugue, where a melody is introduced and then repeated and varied in different voices.
2. A fractal, like the Mandelbrot set, generated by repeating a simple mathematical equation.
3. A poem using a specific rhyme scheme and meter.
4. A tessellation, such as a honeycomb pattern, created by repeating a geometric shape.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A novel with recurring motifs.
6. A song with a chorus.
7. A dance with repeated steps.
8. A building with symmetrical features.
9. A photograph with a repeating pattern of light and shadow.
10. A movie with a recurring theme.
11. A piece of pottery with a decorative pattern.
12. A garden with rows of identical plants.
13. A computer program with a loop.
14. A heartbeat.
15. Breathing.
16. The tides.
17. The seasons.
18. A snowflake.
19. A spiral staircase.
20. A chain link fence.
21. A barcode.
22. Morse code.
23. A fingerprint.
24. DNA.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
