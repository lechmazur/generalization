Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures that use recursive patterns to map or analyze higher-dimensional spaces while maintaining mathematical symmetry

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tessellations of hyperbolic space using regular polygons
2. Recursive fractal antennas designed for multi-band operation
3. Octrees used for spatial partitioning in computer graphics
4. Certain types of cellular automata with high-dimensional rule sets

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A spiral staircase
6. A nautilus shell
7. A tree's branching structure
8. A snowflake
9. A honeycomb
10. A spiderweb
11. A crystal lattice
12. A network of interconnected computers
13. A family tree
14. The veins in a leaf
15. A river delta
16. A map of the London Underground
17. A Penrose tiling
18. A Sierpinski triangle
19. A Mandelbrot set
20. A Julia set
21. A Voronoi diagram
22. A Delaunay triangulation
23. A Hilbert curve
24. A Koch curve

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
