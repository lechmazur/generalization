Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made from dense, dark-colored wood used in both functional and decorative items.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A carved ebony walking stick
2. A rosewood jewelry box inlaid with mother-of-pearl
3. A wambo wood sculpture of an abstract figure
4. A bog oak coffee table with steel legs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A pine bookshelf
6. A cherrywood dining table
7. An oak rocking chair
8. A teak garden bench
9. A mahogany desk
10. A balsa wood model airplane
11. A cedar chest
12. A wicker basket
13. A metal sculpture
14. A glass vase
15. A ceramic bowl
16. A plastic toy
17. A fabric doll
18. A leather wallet
19. A stone carving
20. An ivory chess piece
21. A bamboo floor mat
22. A birch bark canoe
23. A painted wooden birdhouse
24. A maple syrup bottle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
