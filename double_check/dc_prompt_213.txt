Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices that enable direct interaction between human neural activity and external technology for control or communication purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a brain-computer interface headset
2. a neural implant for controlling robotic limbs
3. a wearable EEG device for typing with thoughts
4. a neurostimulation device for communication in locked-in syndrome patients

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a smartphone
6. a virtual reality headset
7. a fitness tracker
8. a smartwatch
9. a voice assistant
10. a gaming console
11. a drone
12. a 3D printer
13. a self-driving car
14. a smart thermostat
15. a Bluetooth headset
16. a digital camera
17. a tablet computer
18. a smart home hub
19. a wireless keyboard
20. a heart rate monitor
21. a GPS device
22. a bionic eye
23. a hearing aid
24. a prosthetic leg

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
