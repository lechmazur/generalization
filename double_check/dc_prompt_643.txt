Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural formations that result from slow accumulation processes over millions of years

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. limestone caves
2. coal deposits
3. coral reefs
4. oil reservoirs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. sand dunes
6. volcanic islands
7. glaciers
8. river deltas
9. geysers
10. waterfalls
11. canyons
12. mountains
13. valleys
14. fjords
15. hot springs
16. sinkholes
17. mudflats
18. salt flats
19. rock arches
20. meteor craters
21. fault lines
22. lava tubes
23. plateaus
24. rift valleys

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
