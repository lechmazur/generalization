Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic techniques or styles that originated as practical solutions to material shortages but later became celebrated aesthetic choices

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Impasto painting
2. Sgraffito pottery
3. The use of found objects in sculpture
4. Batik fabric dyeing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Minimalist architecture
6. Digital art
7. Pointillism
8. Photorealism
9. Surrealism
10. Abstract Expressionism
11. Art Nouveau
12. Gothic architecture
13. Calligraphy
14. Origami
15. Graffiti art
16. Performance art
17. Conceptual art
18. Land art
19. Mosaic art
20. Fresco painting
21. Tempera painting
22. Watercolor painting
23. Woodblock printing
24. Etching

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
