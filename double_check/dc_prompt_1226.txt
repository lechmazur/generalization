Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or human-made structures that form layers or strata, with each layer serving a distinct functional or compositional purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Earth's atmosphere
2. plywood
3. semiconductor chips
4. lasagna

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. brick wall
6. stack of books
7. deck of cards
8. pile of leaves
9. sandwich
10. bookshelf
11. filing cabinet
12. parking garage
13. apartment building
14. stack of papers
15. wedding cake
16. pyramid
17. staircase
18. rock collection
19. library
20. photo album
21. storage boxes
22. tool chest
23. clothing drawer
24. spice rack

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
