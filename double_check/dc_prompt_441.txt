Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures incorporating large, predominantly blue, stained-glass depictions of celestial bodies or events.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Rose Window of Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris
2. The Blue Mosque's stained-glass dome, Istanbul
3. The Great West Window of York Minster, York
4. The Chapel of Thanksgiving's Glory Window, Dallas

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Eiffel Tower, Paris
6. The Colosseum, Rome
7. The Sydney Opera House, Sydney
8. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, Pisa
9. The Parthenon, Athens
10. The Taj Mahal, Agra
11. The Great Wall of China, China
12. The Sagrada Familia, Barcelona
13. The Burj Khalifa, Dubai
14. The Statue of Liberty, New York
15. The Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco
16. The Pyramids of Giza, Egypt
17. The Christ the Redeemer, Rio de Janeiro
18. The Big Ben, London
19. The Empire State Building, New York
20. The Acropolis, Athens
21. The Hagia Sophia, Istanbul
22. The Louvre Pyramid, Paris
23. The Brandenburg Gate, Berlin
24. The Tower of London, London

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
