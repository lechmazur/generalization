Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical methods of mass production that significantly influenced modern manufacturing techniques

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The assembly line used by Henry Ford for the Model T automobile
2. The interchangeable parts system developed by Eli Whitney for muskets
3. The Bessemer process for mass production of steel
4. The mechanized spinning jenny for textile production

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The use of robotics in modern car manufacturing
6. 3D printing technology in prototyping
7. Just-in-time manufacturing systems
8. Lean manufacturing principles
9. Computer-aided design (CAD) software
10. Automation in packaging lines
11. The use of CNC machines in precision manufacturing
12. Supply chain management software
13. Quality control systems in electronics manufacturing
14. Agile manufacturing techniques
15. The application of Six Sigma in process improvement
16. Use of artificial intelligence in predictive maintenance
17. Implementation of ERP systems in factory management
18. The development of smart factories
19. Use of IoT in monitoring production lines
20. Additive manufacturing in aerospace
21. Green manufacturing practices
22. Outsourcing of manufacturing to lower-cost countries
23. Customization in luxury goods production
24. Use of blockchain for supply chain transparency

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
