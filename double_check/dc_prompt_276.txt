Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional navigation methods that rely on natural environmental cues

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Using wave patterns and swells to guide a canoe across the open ocean
2. Following the flight paths of migratory birds to locate land
3. Navigating by the position of stars in the night sky
4. Using prevailing winds to determine direction while sailing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Using a compass
6. Using a sextant
7. Using a GPS device
8. Consulting a map
9. Following a marked trail
10. Using a radio beacon
11. Dead reckoning
12. Using sonar
13. Following animal tracks in the snow
14. Observing the growth patterns of moss on trees
15. Using a chronometer
16. Referring to a nautical chart
17. Using an astrolabe
18. Following a river downstream
19. Using landmarks like mountains or distinctive trees
20. Reading a topographic map
21. Using an odometer
22. Following a road sign
23. Using a weather forecast
24. Using the sun's position to tell time

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
