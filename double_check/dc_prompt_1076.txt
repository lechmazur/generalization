Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures where information or material is selectively passed down or transmitted through a hierarchical or lineage-based mechanism, ensuring continuity while allowing for variation or adaptation over time

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The process of oral tradition in indigenous cultures where stories and knowledge are passed from elders to younger generations, adapting over time.
2. The transmission of genetic material through DNA from parents to offspring, allowing for genetic variation and evolution.
3. The succession of leadership in a monarchy where the throne is passed down through a family line, with potential for changes in ruling style.
4. The inheritance of family recipes where culinary techniques and ingredients are shared across generations, with room for personal touches.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A library's cataloging system that organizes books by subject and author.
6. The spread of a virus through a population, mutating as it infects new hosts.
7. A corporate training program where new employees learn from experienced staff.
8. The peer review process in academic publishing where research is critiqued and improved upon.
9. A social media platform's algorithm that curates content based on user interaction.
10. The process of osmosis where molecules move from areas of high concentration to low concentration.
11. A mentorship program where skills and knowledge are shared between mentor and mentee.
12. The electoral system where citizens vote for representatives to govern on their behalf.
13. A franchise model where business practices are standardized across different locations.
14. The diffusion of innovations where new technologies spread through a society.
15. A news broadcast where information is disseminated to the public.
16. The process of photosynthesis where plants convert sunlight into energy.
17. A university curriculum where knowledge is structured and taught to students.
18. The circulation of currency in an economy, facilitating trade and exchange.
19. A software update system where new versions are released to users.
20. The process of cellular respiration where cells convert nutrients into energy.
21. A public transportation system where people move from one place to another.
22. The spread of a meme across the internet, evolving as it is shared.
23. A legal system where laws are created and enforced by a government.
24. The process of evaporation where water turns into vapor and rises into the atmosphere.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
