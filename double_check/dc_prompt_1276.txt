Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural landmarks that were originally private estates but later repurposed for public or institutional use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Frick Collection, New York City
2. The Getty Villa, Los Angeles
3. Hearst Castle, San Simeon
4. Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, Miami

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Eiffel Tower, Paris
6. The Colosseum, Rome
7. The Louvre Museum, Paris
8. The White House, Washington D.C.
9. The Sydney Opera House, Sydney
10. The Palace of Versailles, Versailles
11. The Parthenon, Athens
12. The Taj Mahal, Agra
13. The Great Wall of China, China
14. The Statue of Liberty, New York City
15. The Acropolis, Athens
16. The Tower of London, London
17. The Forbidden City, Beijing
18. The Sagrada Familia, Barcelona
19. The Pyramids of Giza, Egypt
20. The Burj Khalifa, Dubai
21. The Empire State Building, New York City
22. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, Pisa
23. The Kremlin, Moscow
24. The Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
