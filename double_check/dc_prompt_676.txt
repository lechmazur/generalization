Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific discoveries or inventions that were initially met with skepticism but later became foundational in their respective fields

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Continental drift
2. Germ theory of disease
3. The heliocentric model of the solar system
4. General relativity

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The theory of evolution
6. Quantum mechanics
7. The discovery of penicillin
8. The invention of the printing press
9. The development of the internet
10. The use of anesthesia
11. The discovery of DNA
12. The invention of the telephone
13. The development of vaccines
14. The invention of the airplane
15. The discovery of radioactivity
16. The invention of the automobile
17. The development of nuclear power
18. The invention of the computer
19. The development of space travel
20. The discovery of plate tectonics
21. The invention of the television
22. The development of genetic engineering
23. The invention of the smartphone
24. The development of artificial intelligence

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
