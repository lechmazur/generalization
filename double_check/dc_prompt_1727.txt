Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): ancient structures built before the advent of written language

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Göbekli Tepe in Turkey
2. Stonehenge in England
3. Newgrange in Ireland
4. Ġgantija Temples in Malta

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt
6. The Colosseum in Rome
7. The Parthenon in Athens
8. Angkor Wat in Cambodia
9. Machu Picchu in Peru
10. The Roman Aqueducts
11. The Sphinx in Egypt
12. The Ziggurat of Ur in Iraq
13. Chichen Itza in Mexico
14. The Terracotta Army in China
15. The Pantheon in Rome
16. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
17. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
18. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
19. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia
20. The Lighthouse of Alexandria
21. The Library of Alexandria
22. The Acropolis in Athens
23. The Baths of Caracalla in Rome
24. The Forum Romanum in Rome

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
