Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): innovative food products or concepts that reimagine traditional culinary elements through modern technology or cultural reinterpretation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. 3D-printed plant-based steak
2. AI-generated fusion cuisine recipes
3. Lab-grown seafood with traditional seasoning
4. Smart kitchen appliances that customize ethnic dishes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. organic vegetables
6. traditional sushi
7. homemade pasta
8. classic French baguette
9. locally sourced honey
10. handcrafted cheese
11. traditional wood-fired pizza
12. farm-to-table dining
13. artisanal chocolate
14. gluten-free bread
15. vegan smoothie
16. organic coffee
17. traditional Indian curry
18. fermented kimchi
19. locally brewed craft beer
20. handmade dumplings
21. traditional Greek yogurt
22. classic Caesar salad
23. freshly squeezed juice
24. traditional barbecue sauce

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
