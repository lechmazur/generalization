Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Annual traditional sports festivals in Turkey that have been held for over 600 years

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kirkpinar Oil Wrestling Festival
2. Saltuk Bugra Wrestling Festival
3. Kırkpınar Yağlı Güreşleri
4. Tarihi Elmalı Yağlı Güreşleri

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Camel wrestling
6. Konya Mevlana Festival
7. Istanbul Tulip Festival
8. Aspendos Opera and Ballet Festival
9. Hidrellez celebrations
10. Nevruz celebrations
11. Ramadan celebrations
12. Feast of the Sacrifice (Kurban Bayramı)
13. Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day
14. Victory Day (Zafer Bayramı)
15. Republic Day (Cumhuriyet Bayramı)
16. International Antalya Film Festival
17. Cappadox Festival
18. Akbank Jazz Festival
19. Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey
20. Istanbul Marathon
21. Turkish Grand Prix (Formula 1)
22. Edirne Kakava Festival
23. Mesir Macunu Festival
24. Alanya International Triathlon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
