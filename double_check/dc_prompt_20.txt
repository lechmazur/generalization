Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Japanese cities known for their traditional textile production

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kyoto
2. Kanazawa
3. Kiryu
4. Yonezawa

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Tokyo
6. Osaka
7. Nagoya
8. Sapporo
9. Fukuoka
10. Kobe
11. Hiroshima
12. Sendai
13. Yokohama
14. Kyoto Imperial Palace
15. Nara Park
16. Mount Fuji
17. Sushi
18. Ramen
19. Origami
20. Ikebana
21. Sumo
22. Kabuki
23. Tea ceremony
24. Bonsai

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
