Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that are known for having a significant impact on popular culture and are associated with a specific type of energy or force.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Force from Star Wars
2. Kamehameha from Dragon Ball
3. The Infinity Gauntlet from Marvel
4. Avada Kedavra from Harry Potter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Mona Lisa
6. The Great Wall of China
7. The Beatles
8. The Internet
9. The iPhone
10. The Olympic Games
11. The Nobel Prize
12. The United Nations
13. The World Cup
14. The Renaissance
15. The Industrial Revolution
16. The printing press
17. The steam engine
18. The Theory of Relativity
19. The discovery of penicillin
20. The moon landing
21. The fall of the Berlin Wall
22. The invention of the automobile
23. The personal computer
24. The electric light bulb

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
