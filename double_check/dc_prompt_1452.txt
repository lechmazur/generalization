Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific instruments or devices that create detailed 3D maps of hidden or obscured surfaces through non-invasive scanning

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
2. Lidar Scanner
3. Ultrasound Imaging Device
4. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scanner

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Seismograph
6. Weather Satellite
7. CT Scanner
8. Optical Microscope
9. X-ray Machine
10. Thermal Imaging Camera
11. Endoscope
12. Metal Detector
13. Sonar System
14. Electron Microscope
15. Geiger Counter
16. Barometer
17. Photogrammetry Software
18. Drone with Camera
19. Topographic Map
20. 3D Printer
21. Augmented Reality Glasses
22. Virtual Reality Headset
23. Surveying Theodolite
24. GPS Receiver

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
