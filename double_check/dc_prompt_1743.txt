Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures who were self-taught and became U.S. Presidents

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Abraham Lincoln
2. Andrew Jackson
3. Grover Cleveland
4. Millard Fillmore

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. George Washington
6. Thomas Jefferson
7. John Adams
8. James Madison
9. James Monroe
10. John Quincy Adams
11. Andrew Johnson
12. Ulysses S. Grant
13. Rutherford B. Hayes
14. James A. Garfield
15. Chester A. Arthur
16. Benjamin Harrison
17. William McKinley
18. Theodore Roosevelt
19. William Howard Taft
20. Woodrow Wilson
21. Warren G. Harding
22. Calvin Coolidge
23. Herbert Hoover
24. Franklin D. Roosevelt

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
