Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials or substances that undergo a phase change at temperatures commonly found in everyday environments, leading to a visible transformation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ice melting into water
2. candle wax solidifying as it cools
3. frost forming on a window
4. steam condensing into water droplets on a mirror

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a glass of water
6. a block of wood
7. a piece of metal
8. a rubber band
9. a sheet of paper
10. a plastic bottle
11. a bar of soap
12. a cotton shirt
13. a ceramic mug
14. a brick
15. a leather shoe
16. a glass window
17. a steel spoon
18. a wooden table
19. a concrete wall
20. a woolen sweater
21. a plastic bag
22. a cardboard box
23. a rubber tire
24. a marble countertop

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
