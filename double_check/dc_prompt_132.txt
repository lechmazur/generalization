Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or symbols that incorporate circular or radial symmetry to represent movement, unity, or infinity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Celtic spiral knot
2. Buddhist dharma wheel
3. Ouroboros symbol
4. Mandala pattern

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. infinity symbol
6. peace sign
7. yin yang symbol
8. Olympic rings
9. wedding rings
10. clock face
11. vinyl record
12. bicycle wheel
13. steering wheel
14. compass rose
15. ferris wheel
16. pinwheel
17. spiral staircase
18. DNA helix
19. nautilus shell
20. hurricane symbol
21. crop circle
22. maze pattern
23. labyrinth design
24. spiral galaxy

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
