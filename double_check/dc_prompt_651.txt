Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that incorporate a central void or open space to enhance spiritual or philosophical contemplation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Pantheon in Rome
2. The Rothko Chapel in Houston
3. The Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla
4. The Bagsv√¶rd Church in Copenhagen

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Colosseum in Rome
6. The Guggenheim Museum in New York
7. Fallingwater in Pennsylvania
8. The Sydney Opera House
9. The Taj Mahal in Agra
10. The Great Pyramid of Giza
11. The Eiffel Tower in Paris
12. The Chrysler Building in New York
13. The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco
14. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai
15. The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona
16. St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City
17. Hagia Sophia in Istanbul
18. The Forbidden City in Beijing
19. Machu Picchu in Peru
20. Angkor Wat in Cambodia
21. The Houses of Parliament in London
22. The Brandenburg Gate in Berlin
23. The Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.
24. The Empire State Building in New York

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
