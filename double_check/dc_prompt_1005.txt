Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): sacred musical traditions that originated in specific geographic regions and are still practiced in their original form today

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Samaveda chanting in South India
2. Tsam masked dances in Mongolia
3. Shomyo Buddhist chanting in Japan
4. Ma'ulu'ulu 'O Tonga (Tongan royal dance)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gregorian chant
6. Gospel music
7. Sufi music
8. Qawwali
9. Candombl√© music
10. Gagaku (Japanese court music)
11. Noh theatre
12. Kabuki theatre
13. Gamelan music
14. Kecak dance
15. Flamenco music
16. Klezmer music
17. Native American flute music
18. Powwow music
19. Byzantine chant
20. Taiko drumming
21. Mariachi music
22. Reggae music
23. Aztec dances
24. Hula dancing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
