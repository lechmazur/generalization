Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places in Iceland accessible primarily by car that have names starting with the letter 'R'

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Reykjavik
2. Reykjanes
3. Rif
4. Reykholt

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Þingvellir
6. Akureyri
7. Selfoss
8. Höfn
9. Vík
10. Landmannalaugar
11. Skaftafell
12. Myvatn
13. Húsavík
14. Ísafjörður
15. Keflavík
16. Borgarnes
17. Egilsstaðir
18. Vestmannaeyjar
19. Blönduós
20. Ólafsvík
21. Hella
22. Kirkjubæjarklaustur
23. Grindavík
24. Seyðisfjörður

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
