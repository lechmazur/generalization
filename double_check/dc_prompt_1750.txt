Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Three-dimensional representations of living organisms created through the process of needle felting.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A needle-felted miniature poodle with curly white fur.
2. A needle-felted hummingbird with iridescent green feathers and a long, thin beak.
3. A needle-felted succulent plant with plump, green leaves and delicate pink flowers.
4. A needle-felted mushroom with a bright red cap and white spots.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A crocheted amigurumi of a cat.
6. A clay sculpture of a horse.
7. A wooden carving of a bear.
8. A glass figurine of a dolphin.
9. A drawing of a bird.
10. A photograph of a fish.
11. A knitted sweater with a dog pattern.
12. A stuffed animal elephant.
13. A plastic model of a dinosaur.
14. A metal sculpture of an insect.
15. A painting of a flower.
16. A digital illustration of a tree.
17. A taxidermied butterfly.
18. A preserved specimen of a frog.
19. A felt ball.
20. A piece of wool roving.
21. A set of felting needles.
22. A felted landscape.
23. A needle-felted abstract design.
24. A needle-felted geometric shape.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
