Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring structures that form visible, layered patterns and contain colonies of microorganisms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stromatolites
2. Microbial mats in hot springs
3. Travertine terraces with microbial growth
4. Iron-oxidizing bacterial layers in caves

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Sand dunes
6. Coral reefs
7. Tree rings
8. Glacial ice layers
9. Rock strata
10. Salt flats
11. Cloud formations
12. Mountain ranges
13. River deltas
14. Volcanic lava flows
15. Desert pavement
16. Ocean waves
17. Sandstone arches
18. Granite cliffs
19. Waterfalls
20. Glacial moraines
21. Fossilized bones
22. Seashells on a beach
23. Rainforest canopy
24. Volcanic ash layers

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
