Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Buildings constructed primarily from tuff stone that incorporate elements of Chinese feng shui in their design.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A hillside mansion in Nevada built with ochre-colored tuff, featuring a curved roofline and a koi pond positioned according to the bagua map.
2. A boutique hotel in Cappadocia, Turkey, carved into the tuff cliffs, with interior spaces arranged to maximize natural light and air flow, reflecting feng shui principles.
3. A modern art museum in Armenia constructed from pink tuff, incorporating a central courtyard with a water feature and strategically placed sculptures to enhance the flow of qi.
4. A private residence in New Mexico built with locally sourced tuff, featuring a southwest-facing entrance and an open floor plan designed to promote harmony and balance, in line with feng shui philosophy.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A granite skyscraper with a feng shui-inspired lobby.
6. A limestone temple with a bagua-shaped garden.
7. A sandstone house with a red front door.
8. A brick building with a curved roof.
9. A concrete office building with a water feature.
10. A wooden cabin with a north-facing entrance.
11. A yurt with a circular floor plan.
12. A mud-brick house with strategically placed windows.
13. An adobe structure with a courtyard.
14. A marble palace with a grand staircase.
15. A cave dwelling with natural ventilation.
16. A bamboo house with an open floor plan.
17. A glass skyscraper with a wind chime.
18. A steel bridge with a curved design.
19. A rammed earth house with a south-facing garden.
20. A cob house with a green roof.
21. A straw bale house with a circular driveway.
22. An ice hotel with a minimalist design.
23. A log cabin with a fireplace in the center.
24. A treehouse with a view of the forest.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
