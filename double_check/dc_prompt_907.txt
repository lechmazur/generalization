Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Environments designed for strategic training or simulation that incorporate fantastical or surreal elements as part of their structure or decor.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A zero-gravity chamber painted with Escher-esque impossible staircases and filled with floating geometric shapes for astronaut adaptability training.
2. A corporate negotiation room designed as a whimsical tea party in a giant mushroom forest, used for conflict resolution exercises.
3. An emergency response training facility simulating a flooded cityscape where the water flows upwards and buildings float in mid-air.
4. A virtual reality combat simulator set in a dreamscape where physics are fluid and the environment constantly shifts and morphs.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A flight simulator.
6. A mock courtroom.
7. A military training ground.
8. A medical simulation lab.
9. A virtual reality rollercoaster.
10. A driving simulator.
11. A fire safety training house.
12. A historical reenactment site.
13. A model United Nations conference room.
14. A wilderness survival course.
15. A ropes course.
16. A climbing wall.
17. A paintball arena.
18. A laser tag arena.
19. An escape room.
20. A murder mystery dinner.
21. A historical museum.
22. A science museum.
23. An art gallery.
24. A theme park.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
