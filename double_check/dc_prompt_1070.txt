Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or man-made systems that involve the containment and controlled release of pressure or energy to prevent catastrophic failure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a pressure cooker
2. a hydraulic dam
3. a steam engine
4. a gas cylinder

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bicycle tire
6. a water bottle
7. a balloon
8. a car engine
9. a wind turbine
10. a solar panel
11. a battery
12. a fire extinguisher
13. a scuba tank
14. a kettle
15. a refrigerator
16. a vacuum cleaner
17. a compressor
18. a pump
19. a turbine
20. a generator
21. a transformer
22. a capacitor
23. a fuse
24. a circuit breaker

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
