Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that are known for being unexpectedly quiet despite their typical associations with loudness or intensity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. snowfall
2. electric car
3. library
4. stealth aircraft

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. thunderstorm
6. rock concert
7. fireworks display
8. construction site
9. race car
10. volcano eruption
11. jet engine
12. explosion
13. marching band
14. lion's roar
15. train horn
16. motorcycle
17. factory machinery
18. cannon fire
19. airplane takeoff
20. boxing match
21. fire alarm
22. drum solo
23. demolition
24. football stadium

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
