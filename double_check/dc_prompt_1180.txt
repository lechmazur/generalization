Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural practices or objects that involve the transformation of a natural material into a functional or symbolic form through a specific, ritualized process.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Japanese tea ceremony
2. Native American dreamcatcher
3. Balinese offering baskets
4. Sand mandalas in Tibetan Buddhism

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wooden chair
6. a clay pot
7. a glass vase
8. a metal sculpture
9. a woven basket
10. a stone statue
11. a leather wallet
12. a cotton shirt
13. a wool sweater
14. a paper airplane
15. a plastic bottle
16. a ceramic mug
17. a bamboo flute
18. a silk scarf
19. a bronze medal
20. a rubber ball
21. a gold ring
22. a silver spoon
23. a cotton canvas painting
24. a wooden spoon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
