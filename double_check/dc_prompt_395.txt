Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects found on a beach that are naturally smooth and translucent.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. sea glass
2. polished shell fragments
3. smoothed pebbles
4. translucent jellyfish remnants

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a sandcastle
6. a crab shell
7. a starfish
8. a piece of driftwood
9. a seashell with sharp edges
10. a fishing net
11. a beach towel
12. a coconut
13. a sand dollar
14. a coral fragment
15. a seaweed clump
16. a plastic bottle
17. a flip-flop
18. a beach ball
19. a seagull feather
20. a broken bottle
21. a fishing hook
22. a piece of rope
23. a metal can
24. a beach umbrella

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
