Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative objects incorporating traditional Hungarian folk art motifs rendered in translucent or transparent materials.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A glass vase with etched patterns inspired by Hungarian embroidery designs.
2. A set of translucent acrylic coasters featuring motifs from Hungarian folk costumes.
3. A transparent resin sculpture depicting a scene from Hungarian folklore with traditional patterns.
4. A clear glass bowl with sandblasted designs reminiscent of Hungarian folk art.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A ceramic mug with traditional Hungarian folk art patterns.
6. A wooden sculpture depicting Hungarian folklore scenes.
7. A metal jewelry box with engraved Hungarian motifs.
8. A fabric tapestry showcasing Hungarian embroidery designs.
9. A painted wooden toy horse with Hungarian folk art decorations.
10. A set of opaque porcelain plates with Hungarian folk patterns.
11. A leather-bound book with Hungarian folk art on the cover.
12. A woolen scarf with traditional Hungarian embroidery.
13. A metal pendant necklace featuring Hungarian folk motifs.
14. A hand-painted silk scarf with Hungarian folk designs.
15. A carved wooden chess set with Hungarian folk art elements.
16. A stoneware vase with painted Hungarian folk patterns.
17. A woven basket with Hungarian folk art woven into the design.
18. A set of enameled spoons with Hungarian folk motifs.
19. A hand-knitted sweater with Hungarian embroidery patterns.
20. A painted tin box with Hungarian folk art designs.
21. A clay figurine depicting a character from Hungarian folklore.
22. A hand-stitched quilt with Hungarian folk art motifs.
23. A brass candlestick with engraved Hungarian folk patterns.
24. A set of hand-painted tiles with Hungarian folk designs.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
