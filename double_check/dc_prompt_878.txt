Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or materials that have been used or studied for their unique insulating properties in extreme environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. aerogel
2. permafrost
3. polar bear fur
4. volcanic ash

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a glacier
6. a diamond
7. a lightning rod
8. a solar panel
9. a hurricane
10. a geyser
11. a coral reef
12. a tornado
13. a quartz crystal
14. a thunderstorm
15. a sand dune
16. a rainbow
17. a lava flow
18. a snowflake
19. a tsunami
20. a stalactite
21. a meteorite
22. a fog bank
23. a comet
24. a glacier cave

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
