Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Books written by authors who have also been recognized for their contributions to a different artistic field, such as music or visual arts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Jean-Paul Sartre's "Nausea"
2. Leonardo da Vinci's "Codex Leicester"
3. Bob Dylan's "Chronicles: Volume One"
4. Salvador Dalí's "The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stephen King's "The Shining"
6. J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"
7. Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea"
8. Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice"
9. George Orwell's "1984"
10. Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express"
11. F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby"
12. Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway"
13. Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations"
14. Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"
15. William Shakespeare's "Hamlet"
16. Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace"
17. James Joyce's "Ulysses"
18. Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis"
19. Gabriel García Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude"
20. John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men"
21. Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird"
22. Toni Morrison's "Beloved"
23. Doris Lessing's "The Golden Notebook"
24. Albert Camus' "The Stranger"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
