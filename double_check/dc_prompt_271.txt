Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional ceremonies that involve sorting or arranging items in a specific order

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. prayer beads
2. divination shells
3. tarot cards
4. rune stones

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. incense burner
6. ceremonial drum
7. sacred bell
8. ritual dagger
9. prayer wheel
10. smudge stick
11. altar cloth
12. offering bowl
13. ritual mask
14. ceremonial staff
15. sacred pipe
16. ritual fan
17. blessing cup
18. ceremonial headdress
19. ritual sword
20. sacred mirror
21. ceremonial rattle
22. ritual wand
23. blessing feather
24. sacred candle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
