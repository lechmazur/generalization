Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional performance arts that incorporate elements of satire and parody to critique societal norms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kabuki theater performances that mock political figures through exaggerated gestures and dialogue
2. Commedia dell'arte troupes using stock characters like Harlequin to ridicule social hierarchies
3. Chinese Xiangsheng comedy routines that satirize contemporary societal issues
4. Yoruba Alarinjo theater, where masked performers critique corruption and hypocrisy in society

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a ballet performance of Swan Lake
6. a classical piano recital
7. a Shakespearean tragedy like Hamlet
8. a modern dance piece exploring abstract emotions
9. a traditional Japanese tea ceremony
10. a symphony orchestra playing Beethoven's Fifth
11. a Broadway musical like The Phantom of the Opera
12. a contemporary art installation
13. a folk music concert featuring traditional ballads
14. a mime performance in a public square
15. a poetry reading at a literary festival
16. a circus act with acrobats and clowns
17. a documentary film about wildlife
18. a stand-up comedy routine about personal life
19. a puppet show for children
20. a street art mural
21. a fashion show featuring avant-garde designs
22. a jazz improvisation session
23. a historical reenactment of a medieval battle
24. a silent film from the 1920s

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
