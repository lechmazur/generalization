Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Wetland ecosystems that have inspired major literary works published before 1900

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Everglades in Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Palmetto Leaves" (1873)
2. The Fens in Charles Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" (1864-1865)
3. The Louisiana bayous in George Washington Cable's "Old Creole Days" (1879)
4. The marshes of Kent in Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations" (1861)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Mississippi River in Mark Twain's "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" (1884)
6. The moors in Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights" (1847)
7. The forest in Nathaniel Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter" (1850)
8. The ocean in Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick" (1851)
9. The Alps in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther" (1774)
10. The desert in Gustave Flaubert's "Salammb√¥" (1862)
11. The city of London in Charles Dickens' "Bleak House" (1852-1853)
12. The countryside in Thomas Hardy's "Far from the Madding Crowd" (1874)
13. The jungle in Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book" (1894)
14. The mountains in James Fenimore Cooper's "The Last of the Mohicans" (1826)
15. The sea in Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" (1870)
16. The prairie in Willa Cather's "O Pioneers!" (1913)
17. The Arctic in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" (1818)
18. The heath in Thomas Hardy's "The Return of the Native" (1878)
19. The river in Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" (1899)
20. The island in Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe" (1719)
21. The lake in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's "Faust" (1808)
22. The garden in Frances Hodgson Burnett's "The Secret Garden" (1911)
23. The woods in Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" (1854)
24. The cave in Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" (circa 380 BC)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
