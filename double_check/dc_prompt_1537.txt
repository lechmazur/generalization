Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Coastal religious festivals that involve young women being chosen to reenact historical rescues of brides

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Bride's Jump Festival in Cefal√π, Sicily where young women recreate a Norman maiden's leap to safety
2. The Maiden's Bay Ceremony in Naxos, Greece commemorating the rescue of Ariadne
3. The Bride's Cove Festival in Cornwall celebrating a local legend of saving a kidnapped bride
4. The Mermaid Bride Festival of Jeju Island, Korea reenacting an ancient rescue tale

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Running of the Brides in Boston Harbor
6. Venice Carnival's Marriage to the Sea ceremony
7. Norwegian coastal Viking wedding reenactments
8. Mediterranean fishing boat blessing ceremonies
9. Hawaiian lei throwing celebration for cruise ships
10. Portuguese Festa do Mar
11. Greek Orthodox Epiphany diving for the cross
12. Japanese Dragon Boat Festival
13. Coastal May Day celebrations
14. Scottish Up Helly Aa fire festival
15. Midsummer beach bonfires in Denmark
16. Brazilian Yemanja offerings ceremony
17. Irish blessing of the fleet
18. Philippine Flores de Mayo processions
19. Croatian St. Nicholas Day boat parades
20. Dutch New Herring Festival
21. Malaysian water lantern ceremonies
22. Maltese Feast of St. Peter and St. Paul
23. Breton Pardon processions
24. Spanish La Naval de Manila festival

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
