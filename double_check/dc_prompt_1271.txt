Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): mythological or symbolic entities that represent the disruption or inversion of natural order within their respective cultural or ecological systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fenrir, the monstrous wolf from Norse mythology
2. Typhon, the serpentine giant from Greek mythology
3. Rangda, the demon queen in Balinese mythology
4. Ammit, the devourer of the dead in Egyptian mythology

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Zeus, the king of the Greek gods
6. Thor, the Norse god of thunder
7. Ra, the Egyptian sun god
8. Odin, the chief god in Norse mythology
9. Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea
10. Horus, the Egyptian god of the sky
11. Hera, the Greek goddess of marriage
12. Freya, the Norse goddess of love
13. Anubis, the Egyptian god of mummification
14. Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom
15. Hermes, the Greek messenger god
16. Isis, the Egyptian goddess of magic
17. Apollo, the Greek god of music
18. Set, the Egyptian god of chaos
19. Loki, the Norse trickster god
20. Hades, the Greek god of the underworld
21. Nephthys, the Egyptian goddess of mourning
22. Demeter, the Greek goddess of the harvest
23. Baldr, the Norse god of beauty
24. Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
