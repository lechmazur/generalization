Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products discontinued by their manufacturer due to safety concerns involving documented cases of combustion or explosion during intended use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Bresso Cheese Spreads (specific varieties due to bacterial contamination risk, though not combustion/explosion)
2. Galaxy Note 7 smartphones
3. Hoverboards (certain models due to battery fires)
4. Kidde fire extinguishers (specific models with plastic handles)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ford Pinto (fuel tank design flaw)
6. Tylenol (product tampering)
7. Lawn darts
8. Crib bumpers
9. Takata airbags
10. Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play Sleeper
11. Peloton Tread+
12. Boppy Newborn Loungers
13. IKEA Malm dressers (tip-over hazard)
14. Lead paint
15. Asbestos insulation
16. BPA in baby bottles
17. DePuy ASR hip implants
18. Vioxx (pain medication)
19. Fen-phen (diet drug)
20. Red Dye No. 2
21. Children's pajamas treated with flame retardants
22. Drop-side cribs
23. Bumbo Baby Seats
24. Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway Toys (lead paint)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
