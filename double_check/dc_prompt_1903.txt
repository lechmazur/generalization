Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects with intricate surface patterns that are both functional and decorative.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A hand-carved wooden box with a floral design used to store jewelry
2. A ceramic vase with a geometric pattern used to hold flowers
3. A handwoven tapestry with a repeating motif used as a wall hanging
4. A metal serving tray with an etched design used for presenting food

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A plain white ceramic mug
6. A smooth, unadorned wooden chair
7. A simple glass vase
8. A plain cotton towel
9. A stainless steel water bottle
10. A basic plastic storage container
11. A plain metal filing cabinet
12. A standard light bulb
13. A simple wooden picture frame
14. A plain notebook
15. A brick wall
16. A concrete sidewalk
17. A window pane
18. A blank canvas
19. A piece of blank paper
20. A smooth metal sculpture
21. A solid-colored throw pillow
22. A plain bedsheet
23. A simple doormat
24. A plain umbrella

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
