Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects awarded to individuals for non-military acts of bravery recognized by a national government.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a gold medal for civilian heroism
2. a silver cross for lifesaving
3. a bronze star for acts of valor in non-combat situations
4. a ribboned medallion for exceptional bravery in emergencies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a Purple Heart
6. a Nobel Prize
7. a Grammy Award
8. a Medal of Honor
9. a Pulitzer Prize
10. a Victoria Cross
11. a Congressional Gold Medal
12. an Olympic gold medal
13. a Presidential Medal of Freedom
14. a Carnegie Medal
15. a Silver Star
16. a Distinguished Service Cross
17. a Legion of Merit
18. a Bronze Star Medal
19. a Knight's Cross
20. a Croix de Guerre
21. a George Cross
22. a Medal of Valor
23. a Military Cross
24. a Distinguished Flying Cross

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
