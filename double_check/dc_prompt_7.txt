Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures whose remains have been subject to modern forensic analysis to verify identity or cause of death

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Richard III of England
2. King Tutankhamun
3. Nicholas II of Russia
4. Simón Bolívar

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cleopatra
6. Julius Caesar
7. George Washington
8. Napoleon Bonaparte
9. Queen Victoria
10. Alexander the Great
11. Abraham Lincoln
12. Winston Churchill
13. Leonardo da Vinci
14. Marie Antoinette
15. Joan of Arc
16. Christopher Columbus
17. Albert Einstein
18. Genghis Khan
19. Queen Elizabeth I
20. Thomas Jefferson
21. Martin Luther King Jr.
22. Galileo Galilei
23. Florence Nightingale
24. William Shakespeare

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
