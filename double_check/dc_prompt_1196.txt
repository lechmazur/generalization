Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanisms or systems that use modular, repeatable units to achieve scalability or adaptability in their design or function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Container orchestration systems like Kubernetes
2. Modular synthesizers used in music production
3. Blockchains utilizing linked blocks of data
4. Pre-fabricated housing construction

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A chain of retail stores
6. A colony of ants
7. A flock of birds
8. A school of fish
9. A network of computers
10. A series of books
11. A collection of stamps
12. A set of dishes
13. A train with multiple cars
14. A highway system
15. A power grid
16. The human circulatory system
17. A tree with branches
18. A river with tributaries
19. A fractal pattern
20. A spiral staircase
21. A honeycomb
22. A woven fabric
23. A brick wall
24. A jigsaw puzzle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
