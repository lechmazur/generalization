Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): structures or spaces that were intentionally designed to preserve knowledge or memory but have since been abandoned or forgotten, leaving their original purpose obscured or unrecognizable

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. An ancient library buried beneath a city, its texts lost to time.
2. A forgotten observatory overtaken by forest, its instruments rusted and broken.
3. A derelict museum with exhibits scattered and unrecognizable.
4. An abandoned archive building, its documents decayed and unreadable.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern library with a digital catalog.
6. A historical monument still visited by tourists.
7. A functioning university campus.
8. A well-preserved ancient temple with guided tours.
9. A contemporary art gallery in a bustling city.
10. A national park with maintained trails and signage.
11. A renovated castle turned into a museum.
12. A thriving cultural center hosting regular events.
13. A popular historical reenactment site.
14. A bustling city library with community programs.
15. A famous archaeological site with ongoing excavations.
16. A well-maintained war memorial.
17. A modern science center with interactive exhibits.
18. A restored historical village with active participation.
19. A vibrant public square with historical significance.
20. A contemporary museum with rotating exhibits.
21. A national archive with digitized records.
22. A popular tourist destination with guided tours.
23. A historical library with a preservation program.
24. A cultural heritage site with active conservation efforts.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
