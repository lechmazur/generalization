Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic figures or movements that deliberately rejected mainstream conventions or techniques to create a distinct, often controversial, identity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Dadaism
2. Vienna Secession
3. Futurism
4. Fluxus

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Impressionism
6. Baroque
7. Minimalism
8. Art Nouveau
9. Surrealism
10. Pop Art
11. Conceptual Art
12. Romanticism
13. Realism
14. Abstract Expressionism
15. Street Art
16. Performance Art
17. Installation Art
18. Digital Art
19. Renaissance Art
20. Gothic Art
21. Classical Art
22. Outsider Art
23. Folk Art
24. Op Art

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
