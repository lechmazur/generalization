Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional garments worn by indigenous peoples of the Andean highlands

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. poncho
2. chullo
3. lliclla
4. pollera

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. kimono
6. sari
7. kilt
8. dashiki
9. serape
10. huipil
11. kaftan
12. cheongsam
13. dirndl
14. ao dai
15. hanbok
16. lederhosen
17. boubou
18. kurta
19. kanga
20. sarong
21. qipao
22. thobe
23. bunad
24. yukata

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
