Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional rituals to predict future events or outcomes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a set of rune stones
2. a crystal ball
3. a deck of tarot cards
4. a yarrow stalk used in I Ching

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a ceremonial robe
6. a prayer book
7. a candle
8. a chalice
9. a rosary
10. a dreamcatcher
11. a meditation cushion
12. a ritual dagger
13. a smudging stick
14. a prayer wheel
15. a divining rod
16. a pendulum
17. a Ouija board
18. a horoscope chart
19. a palmistry manual
20. a tea leaf reading cup
21. a scrying mirror
22. a geomancy sand tray
23. a numerology chart
24. a astrology ephemeris

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
