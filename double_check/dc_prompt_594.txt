Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made objects designed primarily for containing or transporting granular material that utilize a flexible, woven or knitted structure as the primary means of containment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Burlap sack of coffee beans
2. Woven polypropylene sandbag
3. Mesh bag of onions
4. Crocheted shopping bag for bulk rice

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Plastic grocery bag
6. Metal bucket of gravel
7. Wooden crate of apples
8. Glass jar of sugar
9. Cardboard box of cereal
10. Plastic container of flour
11. Steel drum of oil
12. Paper bag of groceries
13. Woven basket of fruit
14. Plastic bottle of water
15. Tin can of soup
16. Ceramic pot of soil
17. Leather purse
18. Canvas backpack
19. Suitcase
20. Dump truck
21. Train car
22. Cargo ship
23. Conveyor belt
24. Silo

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
