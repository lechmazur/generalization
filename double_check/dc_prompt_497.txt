Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographic features on Earth that are primarily formed by wind erosion and have a maximum relief of at least 100 meters.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Monument Valley, USA
2. Tassili n'Ajjer, Algeria
3. Ennedi Plateau, Chad
4. The Sphinx, Egypt

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Grand Canyon, USA
6. Aletsch Glacier, Switzerland
7. Mount Everest, Nepal/China
8. Niagara Falls, USA/Canada
9. Victoria Falls, Zambia/Zimbabwe
10. Uluru (Ayers Rock), Australia
11. Meteor Crater, USA
12. Dead Sea, Israel/Jordan
13. Sahara Desert, Africa
14. Amazon River, South America
15. Great Barrier Reef, Australia
16. Galapagos Islands, Ecuador
17. Matterhorn, Switzerland/Italy
18. Kilauea, USA
19. Bay of Fundy, Canada
20. Pantanal, South America
21. Lake Baikal, Russia
22. Namib Desert, Namibia
23. Angel Falls, Venezuela
24. Nile River, Africa

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
