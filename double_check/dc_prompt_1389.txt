Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient cultural artifacts that were historically misinterpreted as astronomical records but later proven to serve ritual purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Venus figurines of the Paleolithic era, initially thought to chart Venus's celestial movements, are now understood as symbols of fertility and abundance.
2. The Nebra sky disk, once interpreted as a sophisticated Bronze Age astronomical clock, is now believed to be a ritual object associated with solar and lunar worship.
3. Certain rock carvings in the American Southwest, initially thought to depict supernovae or comets, are now recognized as representing shamanistic visions or ritual symbols.
4. The alignment of some megalithic tombs in Europe, initially attributed to astronomical observations, is now interpreted as reflecting beliefs about the journey of the soul in the afterlife.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Antikythera mechanism
6. Stonehenge
7. The Nazca Lines
8. The Mayan calendar
9. Egyptian pyramids
10. Gobekli Tepe
11. The Voynich manuscript
12. The Phaistos Disc
13. The Rongorongo script
14. The Baghdad Battery
15. The Piri Reis map
16. The Cochno Stone
17. The Sutton Hoo helmet
18. The Terracotta Army
19. The Moai statues of Easter Island
20. The Golden Bulla of King Darius
21. The Rosetta Stone
22. The Book of Kells
23. The Bayeux Tapestry
24. The Shroud of Turin

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
