Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Public installations that feature interactive water elements and are designed to promote community well-being

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A fountain in a city park where visitors can adjust the water flow and patterns through interactive controls, encouraging community engagement and relaxation.
2. An urban water plaza designed with shallow pools and jets that children and adults can play in, fostering a sense of community and promoting physical activity.
3. A public art installation featuring a series of water walls that respond to touch, creating a dynamic environment that encourages social interaction and mental well-being.
4. An interactive water garden in a community center where visitors can manipulate water streams to create music, promoting both artistic expression and community cohesion.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A sculpture in a public park that does not involve water or interactive elements.
6. A community garden where residents can grow their own vegetables.
7. A public library hosting community events to promote literacy.
8. A city-sponsored yoga class in a public park to promote physical well-being.
9. A mural painted on a building to enhance the aesthetic appeal of a neighborhood.
10. A public bench designed for seating and relaxation without interactive features.
11. A community center offering workshops on mental health and well-being.
12. A playground with traditional swings and slides but no water elements.
13. A public swimming pool that does not feature interactive elements.
14. A city park with walking trails designed to promote physical activity.
15. A public art installation that uses light and sound but no water.
16. A community event featuring live music to foster social connections.
17. A public space with a traditional fountain that does not allow for interaction.
18. A city program offering free fitness classes in public spaces.
19. A community bulletin board where residents can share information and resources.
20. A public park with a pond for fishing but no interactive water elements.
21. A neighborhood cleanup initiative to promote community pride and well-being.
22. A public space with a static water feature that does not encourage interaction.
23. A community center hosting a farmers' market to promote healthy eating.
24. A public art installation that uses kinetic sculptures but no water elements.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
