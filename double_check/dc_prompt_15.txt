Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring geological formations that contain a body of water and are surrounded by vertical rock walls on at least three sides

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Crater Lake in Oregon
2. Devils Punchbowl in California
3. Horseshoe Bend in Arizona
4. Lake Powell in Utah

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a river delta
6. a coral reef
7. a sand dune
8. a glacier
9. a hot spring
10. a waterfall
11. a marsh
12. a canyon
13. a geyser
14. a fjord
15. a tidal pool
16. a volcanic crater
17. a sinkhole
18. a lagoon
19. a sea cave
20. a plateau
21. a mountain peak
22. a river gorge
23. a salt flat
24. a coastal cliff

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
