Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or entities that serve as containers for preserving or protecting something culturally, historically, or symbolically significant, but are themselves often overlooked or undervalued.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a time capsule buried in a schoolyard
2. a museum storage crate holding ancient artifacts
3. a family heirloom jewelry box passed down through generations
4. a forgotten attic trunk containing wartime letters

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a library bookshelf
6. a treasure chest
7. a refrigerator
8. a bank vault
9. a shipping container
10. a backpack
11. a photo album
12. a safe deposit box
13. a display case
14. a toolbox
15. a cookie jar
16. a filing cabinet
17. a jewelry store
18. a museum exhibit
19. a storage unit
20. a lunchbox
21. a trophy case
22. a glove compartment
23. a wine cellar
24. a closet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
