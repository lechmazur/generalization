Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products that were initially developed for a specific industrial or scientific purpose and later adapted for widespread public use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Microwave oven
2. Post-it Notes
3. Velcro
4. GPS technology

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphone
6. Electric toothbrush
7. Digital camera
8. Bluetooth speaker
9. LED light bulb
10. Electric car
11. Smartwatch
12. Tablet computer
13. Wireless earbuds
14. 3D printer
15. Streaming service
16. Virtual reality headset
17. Smart thermostat
18. Fitness tracker
19. Drone
20. Electric scooter
21. Smart home assistant
22. Hybrid car
23. Digital assistant
24. Smart TV

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
