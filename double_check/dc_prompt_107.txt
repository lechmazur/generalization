Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or structures that undergo a deliberate, controlled process of transformation to achieve a refined or iconic form over time

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. bonsai trees
2. aged whiskey
3. Stradivarius violins
4. Damascus steel blades

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. weathered driftwood
6. rusted metal
7. eroded canyon walls
8. fossilized remains
9. dried flowers
10. fallen leaves
11. melted candles
12. faded photographs
13. worn leather boots
14. petrified wood
15. oxidized copper statues
16. sun-bleached fabrics
17. crumbling ruins
18. withered plants
19. tarnished silver
20. decomposed matter
21. yellowed paper
22. chipped paint
23. warped wood
24. crystallized honey

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
