Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects named after mathematicians that are used in computational algorithms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Newton's method
2. Gauss-Seidel method
3. Euler's totient function
4. Chebyshev polynomials

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Fibonacci sequence
6. Pythagorean theorem
7. Riemann zeta function
8. Boolean algebra
9. Taylor series
10. Laplace transform
11. Fourier transform
12. Markov chain
13. Bayesian probability
14. Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
15. Dirac delta function
16. Hamiltonian mechanics
17. Lagrange multiplier
18. Poisson distribution
19. Gaussian distribution
20. Cartesian coordinate system
21. Euclidean geometry
22. Mandelbrot set
23. Hilbert space
24. Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
