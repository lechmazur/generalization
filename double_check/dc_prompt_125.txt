Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): forces or phenomena that govern interactions at vastly different scales, from the microscopic to the cosmic, and are fundamental to the structure or behavior of their respective systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Electromagnetism
2. Gravity
3. Strong nuclear force
4. Weak nuclear force

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Friction
6. Surface tension
7. Viscosity
8. Elasticity
9. Buoyancy
10. Pressure
11. Temperature
12. Entropy
13. Diffusion
14. Osmosis
15. Convection
16. Radiation
17. Inertia
18. Momentum
19. Energy
20. Velocity
21. Acceleration
22. Centripetal force
23. Torque
24. Air resistance

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
