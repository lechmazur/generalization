Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or cultural artifacts named after celestial events or astronomical observations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Moonflower
2. Aurora lipstick
3. Eclipse gum
4. Halley's comet nail polish

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Jupiter
6. Orion's Belt
7. The Big Dipper
8. Milky Way galaxy
9. Starfish
10. Sunflower
11. Moonstone
12. Stardust
13. Solar panel
14. Lunar calendar
15. Astronomy textbook
16. Telescope
17. Sundial
18. Constellation map
19. Star fruit
20. Moon boots
21. Saturn's rings
22. Solar wind
23. Meteor shower
24. Northern Lights

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
