Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Annual cultural festivals that involve creating temporary structures from plant materials which are later ritually destroyed

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Krathong floating vessels in Thailand's Loy Krathong
2. Las Fallas festival sculptures in Valencia, Spain
3. Durga Puja pandals in Kolkata, India
4. Zozobra effigy at Santa Fe Fiesta

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Christmas tree displays
6. Day of the Dead altars
7. Harvest corn mazes
8. Chinese New Year lantern displays
9. Easter egg trees
10. Midsummer pole decorations
11. Halloween jack-o'-lanterns
12. Rose Parade floats
13. Ice sculpture festivals
14. Sand castle competitions
15. Carnival parade floats
16. Cherry blossom festivals
17. Tulip festivals
18. Botanical garden light shows
19. Harvest festival displays
20. Garden maze installations
21. Flower carpet festivals
22. Winter solstice bonfires
23. New Year's Eve fireworks
24. Summer music festival stages

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
