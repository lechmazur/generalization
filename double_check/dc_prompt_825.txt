Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematicians who have won the Fields Medal and have an asteroid named after them

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Alain Connes
2. Vladimir Voevodsky
3. Laurent Schwartz
4. Jean-Pierre Serre

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Albert Einstein
6. Terence Tao
7. Andrew Wiles
8. Henri Poincaré
9. Carl Friedrich Gauss
10. Grigori Perelman
11. Stephen Hawking
12. Isaac Newton
13. Leonhard Euler
14. David Hilbert
15. Pierre de Fermat
16. Bernhard Riemann
17. John Nash
18. Maryam Mirzakhani
19. Kurt Gödel
20. Paul Erdős
21. Srinivasa Ramanujan
22. Cedric Villani
23. Peter Scholze
24. William Thurston

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
