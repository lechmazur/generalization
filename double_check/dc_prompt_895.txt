Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or structures that have been used as metaphors for human ambition or achievement in literature or art

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Everest
2. The North Star
3. The Great Oak
4. The Ocean

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Grand Canyon
6. A rainbow
7. Lightning bolts
8. Waterfalls
9. Volcanoes
10. Glaciers
11. The Aurora Borealis
12. Sand dunes
13. Geysers
14. Coral reefs
15. Redwood trees
16. Hurricanes
17. Desert mirages
18. Stalactites
19. Meteor showers
20. Quicksand
21. Whirlpools
22. Avalanches
23. Hot springs
24. Tornadoes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
