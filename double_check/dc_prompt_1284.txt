Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures or systems designed to mimic or integrate natural forms or processes for functional or aesthetic purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Eden Project's hexagonal biome domes
2. The Eastgate Centre in Harare
3. The Lotus Temple in Delhi
4. The Beijing National Stadium

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Pyramid of Giza
6. A traditional Japanese garden
7. The Parthenon
8. A greenhouse
9. The Eiffel Tower
10. A wooden treehouse
11. The Roman Colosseum
12. A stone bridge
13. The Sydney Opera House
14. A bamboo pavilion
15. The Taj Mahal
16. A glass conservatory
17. The Empire State Building
18. A concrete dam
19. Notre Dame Cathedral
20. An adobe dwelling
21. The Panama Canal
22. A windmill
23. The Golden Gate Bridge
24. A log cabin

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
