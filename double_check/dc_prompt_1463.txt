Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or collections kept by nobility that were believed to capture or contain supernatural phenomena prior to 1900

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A bezoar purported to protect against poison
2. A grimoire owned by a royal sorcerer
3. A saint's relic said to grant miracles
4. A unicorn horn believed to purify water

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A first edition of Shakespeare's Hamlet
6. A collection of ancient Roman coins
7. A jeweled scepter symbolizing royal authority
8. A portrait of a deceased monarch
9. An ornate suit of armor
10. A menagerie of exotic animals
11. A botanical garden with rare plants
12. A library of illuminated manuscripts
13. A collection of antique clocks
14. A cabinet of curiosities containing natural specimens
15. A mummified cat from ancient Egypt
16. A piece of the True Cross
17. A lock of hair from a beloved relative
18. A shrunken head from a tribal culture
19. A medieval torture device
20. A map claiming to show the location of El Dorado
21. An automaton that mimics human movement
22. A crystal ball used for scrying
23. A tarot deck used for divination
24. A signed photograph of a famous opera singer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
