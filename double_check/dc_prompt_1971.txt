Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical functions named after their inventors that are used in advanced calculus and special function theory.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hermite polynomials
2. Laguerre polynomials
3. Bessel functions
4. Airy function

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Riemann integral
6. Laplace transform
7. Fourier series
8. Taylor series
9. Newton's method
10. Euler's formula
11. Gaussian distribution
12. Poisson distribution
13. Fibonacci sequence
14. Pythagorean theorem
15. Leibniz's rule
16. L'HÃ´pital's rule
17. Cauchy's integral theorem
18. Green's theorem
19. Stokes' theorem
20. Divergence theorem
21. Chebyshev polynomials
22. Legendre polynomials
23. Gamma function
24. Beta function

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
