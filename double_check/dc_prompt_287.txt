Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems designed for directional air circulation that utilize a rotating mechanism with blades or vanes to generate airflow.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a ceiling fan
2. an industrial exhaust fan
3. a desk fan
4. a helicopter rotor

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wind turbine
6. an air conditioner
7. a jet engine
8. a propeller
9. a ventilation system
10. a leaf blower
11. a hair dryer
12. a vacuum cleaner
13. a turbine
14. a compressor
15. a pump
16. a blower
17. a fan belt
18. a cooling tower
19. a radiator fan
20. a turbofan
21. a ramjet
22. a centrifugal fan
23. a paddle wheel
24. a mixer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
