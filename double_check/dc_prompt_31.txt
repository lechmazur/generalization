Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools or systems designed for analyzing the composition of a specific substance through direct physical interaction with a sample.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A mass spectrometer used to determine the isotopic composition of a solid sample.
2. An X-ray fluorescence analyzer employed to identify the elemental makeup of a mineral specimen.
3. A gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer for analyzing the chemical components of a volatile liquid sample.
4. An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer used to quantify trace elements in a water sample.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A software program that predicts molecular structures based on theoretical models.
6. A database that stores information about chemical compositions without direct sample interaction.
7. A remote sensing satellite that detects changes in vegetation over time.
8. A handheld device that measures air quality without analyzing specific substances.
9. A laboratory centrifuge used to separate components of a mixture based on density.
10. A pH meter that measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.
11. A microscope used to visually inspect the surface of a material.
12. A device that measures the temperature of a substance without analyzing its composition.
13. A tool that calculates the nutritional content of food based on a database of ingredients.
14. A system that monitors the flow rate of a liquid through a pipeline.
15. A device that measures the electrical conductivity of a solution.
16. A tool used to measure the viscosity of a liquid.
17. A device that detects the presence of radiation in an environment.
18. A system that analyzes the color of a substance using a spectrophotometer.
19. A tool that measures the hardness of a material.
20. A device that detects the presence of specific gases in the air.
21. A system that measures the turbidity of water.
22. A tool that calculates the energy content of a fuel based on its chemical formula.
23. A device that measures the humidity in a room.
24. A system that analyzes the particle size distribution of a powder.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
