Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that were initially developed for military purposes but later found significant applications in civilian life.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The technology behind the internet was initially developed by the U.S. Department of Defense.
2. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology was originally developed for military navigation.
3. The development of duct tape was spurred by the needs of the U.S. military during World War II.
4. Microwave ovens were an accidental discovery during radar-related research for the military.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Inventions that were created for space exploration and later used in everyday life.
6. Technologies developed for medical purposes that found applications in other fields.
7. Consumer products that were inspired by science fiction.
8. Technological advancements that were initially developed for industrial use and later adapted for home use.
9. Innovations that were created for environmental monitoring and later used in other sectors.
10. Technologies developed for educational purposes that found applications in the entertainment industry.
11. Products that were initially designed for professional athletes and later became popular among amateurs.
12. Inventions that were created for agricultural purposes and later used in other industries.
13. Technologies developed for automotive safety that found applications in other vehicles.
14. Innovations that were initially developed for the energy sector and later used in consumer products.
15. Technologies that were created for telecommunications and later adapted for other uses.
16. Products that were initially designed for the hospitality industry and later used in homes.
17. Inventions that were created for the fashion industry and later found applications in other fields.
18. Technologies developed for the entertainment industry that found applications in education.
19. Innovations that were initially developed for the construction industry and later used in other sectors.
20. Products that were created for the aviation industry and later adapted for other uses.
21. Technologies that were developed for the maritime industry and later found applications in other fields.
22. Inventions that were created for the mining industry and later used in other sectors.
23. Technologies developed for the food industry that found applications in other areas.
24. Innovations that were initially developed for the transportation industry and later used in consumer products.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
