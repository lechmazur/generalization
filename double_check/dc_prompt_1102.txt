Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or artifacts whose primary function or design is influenced by the natural aging process of organic materials over time.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a leather-bound journal with weathered pages
2. a wooden barrel used for aging wine
3. a vintage photograph with faded colors
4. a pair of denim jeans with natural wear patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a plastic water bottle
6. a stainless steel knife
7. a glass vase
8. a ceramic mug
9. a synthetic rubber tire
10. a silicone baking mat
11. a polyester jacket
12. a nylon rope
13. a vinyl record
14. a metal keychain
15. a concrete block
16. a fiberglass boat
17. a latex balloon
18. a PVC pipe
19. a carbon fiber bicycle frame
20. a Teflon-coated frying pan
21. a polystyrene foam cup
22. a polycarbonate water bottle
23. a rayon scarf
24. a neoprene wetsuit

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
