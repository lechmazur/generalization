Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that represent a significant advancement in a field but were initially met with widespread skepticism or ridicule from experts within that field.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Heliocentric model of the solar system
2. Plate tectonics theory
3. Germ theory of disease
4. Quantum mechanics

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Invention of the light bulb
6. Discovery of penicillin
7. Development of the internet
8. Invention of the airplane
9. First moon landing
10. Invention of the telephone
11. Discovery of DNA structure
12. Development of the steam engine
13. Invention of the printing press
14. Discovery of electricity
15. Invention of the wheel
16. Development of the personal computer
17. First successful heart transplant
18. Invention of the automobile
19. Discovery of radioactivity
20. Development of the vaccine
21. Invention of the camera
22. Discovery of the electron
23. Invention of the microwave oven
24. First powered flight

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
