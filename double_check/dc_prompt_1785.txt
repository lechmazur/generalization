Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): inventions from the 1950s that significantly impacted computing

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. magnetic core memory
2. FORTRAN programming language
3. disk storage drive
4. magnetic tape drive

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. punch card system
6. ENIAC computer
7. transistor radio
8. color television
9. microchip
10. computer mouse
11. BASIC programming language
12. floppy disk
13. vacuum tube
14. COBOL programming language
15. electronic calculator
16. integrated circuit
17. ASCII code
18. semiconductor
19. mainframe computer
20. microprocessor
21. ethernet
22. hard disk drive
23. RAM memory
24. binary code

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
