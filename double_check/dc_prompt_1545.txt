Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that require solving sequential physical puzzles or riddles to gain full access to their interior spaces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A series of interconnected chambers in an ancient temple, where each chamber's exit is locked by a unique mechanical puzzle that must be solved to proceed further into the temple.
2. An old manor house with a hidden library that can only be accessed by solving a sequence of riddles found in various rooms, each riddle leading to the next until the final puzzle unlocks the library door.
3. A modern art installation featuring a maze-like structure where visitors must solve a series of physical puzzles at different checkpoints to unlock new sections and ultimately reach the central exhibit.
4. An escape room designed as a medieval castle, where participants must solve a series of sequential physical puzzles and riddles to move from one room to another, culminating in accessing the treasure room.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A building with a single locked door that requires a key to enter.
6. A museum exhibit where visitors can interact with puzzles but do not need to solve them to move through the space.
7. A house with a secret room that can be accessed by pressing a hidden button.
8. A playground with various physical challenges but no sequential access to different areas.
9. A library where books are organized in a puzzle-like manner but accessing them does not require solving puzzles.
10. An amusement park ride with a storyline involving puzzles, but the ride itself does not require solving them to proceed.
11. A building with an elevator that requires a code to operate, but the code is given directly without solving puzzles.
12. A historical site with informational plaques that include riddles, but solving them is not necessary to explore the site.
13. A themed restaurant where diners can participate in puzzle-solving games at their tables, but it does not affect their dining experience.
14. A sculpture garden where some sculptures are designed as puzzles, but solving them does not grant access to new areas.
15. A building with a security system that requires biometric scanning to enter, but no puzzles are involved.
16. A game show set where contestants solve puzzles to win prizes, but the set itself does not require puzzle-solving to navigate.
17. A hotel with themed rooms that include puzzles as part of the decor, but solving them is not necessary to use the room.
18. A public park with a labyrinth where visitors can walk through without solving any puzzles.
19. A building with a series of doors that require different keys, but the keys are provided without solving puzzles.
20. An art gallery where some artworks are interactive puzzles, but solving them does not unlock new gallery spaces.
21. A historical reenactment event where participants solve puzzles as part of the activities, but it does not affect their movement through the event space.
22. A building with a complex layout that requires a map to navigate, but no puzzles are involved in accessing different areas.
23. A themed escape room where participants solve puzzles to escape, but the room itself does not represent an architectural structure.
24. A building with a series of locked rooms that require different codes to enter, but the codes are given without solving puzzles.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
