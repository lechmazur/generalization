Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural or natural phenomena that mark the end of a cycle or process, often accompanied by a symbolic or ritualistic significance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. harvest festival
2. graduation ceremony
3. funeral rites
4. winter solstice celebration

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. birthday party
6. wedding reception
7. retirement gift
8. final exam
9. closing credits
10. last chapter
11. finish line
12. curtain call
13. game over screen
14. expiration date
15. sunset
16. full moon
17. new year's eve
18. season finale
19. last dance
20. farewell speech
21. closing bell
22. grand finale
23. checkered flag
24. end credits song

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
