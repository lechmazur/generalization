Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring phenomena that cause permanent physical changes to rock formations through cyclical freezing and thawing

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. frost wedging in mountain cliffs
2. ice-driven rock splitting in coastal sea stacks
3. frost shattering of canyon walls
4. periglacial weathering of exposed bedrock

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. wind erosion of desert formations
6. chemical weathering from acid rain
7. root wedging from tree growth
8. wave action on coastal cliffs
9. volcanic activity reshaping mountains
10. glacial scouring of valleys
11. earthquake-induced rockfalls
12. salt crystallization in desert rocks
13. thermal expansion cracking
14. landslides reshaping hillsides
15. river erosion of canyon walls
16. biological weathering from lichens
17. avalanche damage to rock faces
18. mudflow alterations to rock surfaces
19. tidal erosion of sea caves
20. sand blasting of rock formations
21. oxidation of iron-rich rocks
22. dissolution of limestone
23. hydrothermal alteration of rocks
24. mechanical weathering from temperature changes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
