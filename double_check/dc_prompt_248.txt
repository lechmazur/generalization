Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Everyday objects invented in the 19th century that significantly improved personal safety or convenience

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. safety matches
2. rubber gloves
3. safety pins
4. combination locks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. stone tools
6. bronze spears
7. medieval armor
8. sundials
9. smoke signals
10. carrier pigeons
11. digital watches
12. smartphones
13. plastic containers
14. nylon ropes
15. LED lights
16. solar panels
17. ancient pottery
18. medieval locks
19. Roman roads
20. microwave ovens
21. television sets
22. radar systems
23. antibiotics
24. credit cards

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
