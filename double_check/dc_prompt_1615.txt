Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations where traditional festivals or ceremonies are held specifically to honor or appease spirits believed to emerge from bodies of water

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Loch Ness, Scotland
2. Lake Toba, Indonesia
3. Lake Titicaca, Peru/Bolivia
4. Lake Biwa, Japan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge, England
6. Mount Fuji, Japan
7. Uluru, Australia
8. Grand Canyon, USA
9. Great Wall of China, China
10. Chichen Itza, Mexico
11. Christ the Redeemer, Brazil
12. Colosseum, Italy
13. Petra, Jordan
14. Machu Picchu, Peru
15. Taj Mahal, India
16. Eiffel Tower, France
17. Mount Everest, Nepal
18. Niagara Falls, USA/Canada
19. Victoria Falls, Zambia/Zimbabwe
20. Yellowstone National Park, USA
21. Banff National Park, Canada
22. Gal√°pagos Islands, Ecuador
23. Serengeti National Park, Tanzania
24. Amazon Rainforest, South America

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
