Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional rituals that produce a low, continuous sound

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tibetan singing bowl
2. Didgeridoo
3. Rainstick
4. Conch shell horn

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Drum
6. Gong
7. Bell
8. Tambourine
9. Flute
10. Maracas
11. Harp
12. Violin
13. Trumpet
14. Clarinet
15. Bagpipes
16. Castanets
17. Accordion
18. Harmonica
19. Triangle
20. Ukulele
21. Pan flute
22. Cello
23. Oboe
24. Sitar

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
