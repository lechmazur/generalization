Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures that incorporate redundancy to prevent catastrophic failure in high-risk environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Nuclear power plant cooling systems
2. Commercial aircraft hydraulic control surfaces
3. Space shuttle navigation computers
4. Hospital backup power generators

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Fire sprinkler system
6. Bicycle hand brakes
7. Car airbags
8. Building security cameras
9. Computer password protection
10. Smoke detectors
11. Emergency exit doors
12. Surge protectors
13. Elevator safety brakes
14. Life jackets
15. Safety goggles
16. Hard hats
17. Steel-toed boots
18. Seat belts
19. Lightning rods
20. Antivirus software
21. Bulletproof glass
22. Guard rails
23. Circuit breakers
24. Firewall systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
