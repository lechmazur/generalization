Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artistic or creative works that incorporate a strict, mathematically derived structure or system as a foundational element of their composition

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Serialism in the music of Arnold Schoenberg, where the composition is based on a series of tones arranged in a specific order and manipulated according to strict rules.
2. The visual art of Sol LeWitt, where the artwork is created from a set of instructions or algorithms, resulting in geometric patterns and structures.
3. The poetry of the Oulipo group, such as Georges Perec's "La Disparition," which is written entirely without the letter "e," following a strict constraint.
4. The architectural designs of Buckminster Fuller, such as the geodesic dome, which are based on mathematical principles and geometric patterns.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting inspired by the artist's emotions and feelings.
6. A novel with a free-flowing narrative structure.
7. A jazz improvisation that follows no predetermined pattern.
8. A sculpture created through spontaneous artistic expression.
9. A film with a non-linear storyline and loose structure.
10. A dance performance choreographed based on the dancers' interpretations of the music.
11. A piece of music composed using traditional harmonic progressions.
12. A photograph taken to capture a moment in time without any pre-planned composition.
13. A play with a flexible script that allows for improvisation by the actors.
14. A fashion design inspired by current trends and personal style.
15. A landscape painting that focuses on the natural beauty of the scene.
16. A piece of pottery shaped by hand without the use of any specific measurements.
17. A graphic novel with a narrative that evolves organically as the story progresses.
18. A performance art piece that relies on audience interaction and spontaneity.
19. A culinary dish created through experimentation with flavors and ingredients.
20. A video game with a storyline that adapts to the player's choices.
21. A piece of jewelry designed based on the artist's intuition and aesthetic sense.
22. A mural painted to express the artist's political or social views.
23. A song written based on the songwriter's personal experiences and emotions.
24. A theatrical production that follows a traditional three-act structure.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
