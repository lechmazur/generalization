Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or structures that were once functional but have since been repurposed or abandoned, retaining traces of their original use while serving a new or unintended purpose

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. an old railway bridge now used as a pedestrian walkway
2. a water tower converted into a luxury apartment
3. a church building transformed into a bookstore
4. an abandoned missile silo turned underground data center

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a demolished factory site
6. a new shopping mall
7. an ancient Roman ruin
8. a preserved historic landmark
9. a renovated office building
10. an empty warehouse
11. a modern train station
12. a functioning lighthouse
13. a museum artifact
14. an archaeological dig site
15. a restored vintage car
16. an active military base
17. a public monument
18. a ghost town
19. a working farm silo
20. an old photograph
21. a decommissioned ship
22. a time capsule
23. a construction site
24. an antique telephone

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
