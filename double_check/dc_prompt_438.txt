Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed and built by humans that utilize tensioned, flexible members to create a stable, three-dimensional structure larger than 10 meters in at least one dimension.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A cable-stayed bridge with a main span exceeding 10 meters.
2. A suspension bridge with a deck length over 10 meters.
3. A large circus tent with a center pole and tensioned canvas roof exceeding 10 meters in diameter.
4. A tensegrity structure used as a public art installation, standing over 10 meters tall.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bicycle wheel
6. A fishing rod
7. A trampoline
8. A rubber band
9. A guitar string
10. A bow and arrow
11. A catapult
12. A crane
13. A skyscraper
14. A dam
15. An arch bridge
16. A geodesic dome less than 10 meters in diameter
17. A hammock
18. A clothesline
19. A spider web
20. A volleyball net
21. A sail boat
22. A kite
23. A hot air balloon
24. A suspension bridge model less than 10 meters long

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
