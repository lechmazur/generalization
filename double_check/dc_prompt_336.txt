Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographic locations named after women who were directly involved in their exploration or establishment, excluding royalty and religious figures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lake Louise
2. Mount Edith Cavell
3. Amelia Earhart Peak
4. Clara Barton Parkway

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Victoria Falls
6. Queen Elizabeth National Park
7. St. Helena Island
8. Marie Byrd Land
9. Angel Falls
10. Mount St. Helens
11. Lake Victoria
12. Queen Maud Land
13. Santa Monica Mountains
14. St. Mary's River
15. Princess Royal Island
16. Queen Charlotte Sound
17. St. Lawrence River
18. Mount Saint Elias
19. Queen Anne's Revenge
20. Santa Cruz Island
21. St. John's Island
22. Queen's University
23. St. George's Channel
24. Princess Margaret Range

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
