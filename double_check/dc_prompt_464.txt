Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures exhibiting tessellated patterns derived from fossilized biological remains.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A decorative wall panel inlaid with polished ammonite slices arranged in a spiral pattern.
2. A tabletop made from a cross-section of a petrified wood log, showcasing the cellular structure in a repeating pattern.
3. A mosaic floor composed of numerous small, fossilized crinoid stems arranged in a honeycomb pattern.
4. A piece of jewelry featuring a polished section of fossilized coral exhibiting a repeating radial pattern.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A beehive
6. A brick wall
7. A tiled bathroom floor
8. A honeycomb
9. A pineapple
10. A snake's scales
11. A fish's scales
12. A woven basket
13. A chain-link fence
14. A spiderweb
15. A fingerprint
16. A snowflake
17. A quartz crystal
18. A geode
19. A piece of sedimentary rock
20. A dinosaur skeleton
21. A trilobite fossil
22. A leaf
23. A flower petal arrangement
24. A diatom

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
