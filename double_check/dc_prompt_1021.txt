Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical structures or systems that exhibit self-similarity across multiple scales and are defined by recursive or iterative processes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Mandelbrot Set
2. A Koch Snowflake
3. A Cantor Set
4. Sierpinski Triangle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A logarithmic spiral
6. A Fibonacci sequence
7. A tree branching pattern
8. A snowflake (real, not idealized)
9. A coastline
10. A fern leaf
11. The veins in a leaf
12. A Romanesco broccoli
13. A crystal lattice
14. A nautilus shell
15. A human circulatory system
16. A fractal antenna
17. The rings of Saturn
18. A spiral galaxy
19. A cellular automaton (e.g., Conway's Game of Life)
20. A recursive algorithm (e.g., factorial calculation)
21. A nested Russian doll
22. A chain of linked paperclips
23. A lightning bolt
24. A mountain range

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
