Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional tools or methods used by indigenous cultures for survival in extreme climates

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. igloo construction techniques
2. use of animal hides for insulation
3. snow goggles carved from bone or wood
4. stone-lined pit ovens for cooking in arid regions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a solar-powered flashlight
6. a modern snowmobile
7. a synthetic thermal blanket
8. a gas-powered generator
9. a high-tech weather station
10. a portable water filter
11. a GPS navigation device
12. a wind turbine
13. a heated jacket
14. a fire extinguisher
15. a survival knife
16. a camping tent
17. a first aid kit
18. a compass
19. a flare gun
20. a dehydrated meal pack
21. a satellite phone
22. a climbing harness
23. a waterproof backpack
24. a multi-tool

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
