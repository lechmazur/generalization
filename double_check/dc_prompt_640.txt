Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural resources that were historically used as currency and are now primarily valued for their non-monetary uses

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Salt
2. Copper
3. Tea
4. Shells

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gold
6. Silver
7. Bitcoin
8. Diamonds
9. Paper money
10. Credit cards
11. Platinum
12. Cryptocurrency
13. Barley
14. Iron
15. Oil
16. Coal
17. Wheat
18. Rice
19. Leather
20. Ivory
21. Spices
22. Amber
23. Glass beads
24. Livestock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
