Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in spiritual practices that are made from non-metallic materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a wooden prayer bead
2. a clay incense holder
3. a woven meditation mat
4. a crystal healing wand

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a silver chalice
6. a bronze statue
7. a gold amulet
8. a steel ritual knife
9. a copper bowl
10. a pewter candle holder
11. a titanium pendant
12. an iron bell
13. a brass incense burner
14. a metal singing bowl
15. a glass orb
16. a plastic rosary
17. a ceramic vase
18. a leather-bound book
19. a paper talisman
20. a silk scarf
21. a feather headdress
22. a bone carving
23. a shell necklace
24. a wooden flute

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
