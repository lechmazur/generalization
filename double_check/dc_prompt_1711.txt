Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artificial or natural systems that maintain stability by releasing excess pressure through a designated overflow pathway

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A pressure cooker with a release valve
2. A river floodplain acting as a buffer during floods
3. An overflow pipe in a water tank preventing overfilling
4. A volcano releasing pressure through eruptions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A tea kettle whistling
6. A balloon popping
7. A dam controlling water flow
8. A geyser erupting
9. A tire with a slow leak
10. A safety valve on a gas cylinder
11. A capacitor discharging
12. A lightning strike
13. A fuse blowing
14. A circuit breaker tripping
15. Tears relieving emotional stress
16. A person screaming to release anger
17. A garden hose spraying water
18. A sprinkler system irrigating a lawn
19. A water fountain bubbling
20. A dripping faucet
21. A sewer system managing wastewater
22. A sump pump removing excess water
23. A fire extinguisher suppressing flames
24. A car's radiator cooling the engine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
