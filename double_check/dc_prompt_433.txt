Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for human use that incorporate a rotating element driven by a coiled spring as their primary mechanism of function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. wind-up toy car
2. mechanical alarm clock
3. music box
4. wind-up flashlight

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. electric fan
6. bicycle wheel
7. spinning top
8. pinwheel
9. water wheel
10. hand-crank pencil sharpener
11. manual egg beater
12. potter's wheel
13. hamster wheel
14. ferris wheel
15. electric drill
16. ceiling fan
17. windmill
18. merry-go-round
19. record player
20. washing machine
21. mechanical metronome
22. rotary phone dial
23. combination lock
24. watch with quartz movement

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
