Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures designed for topical application that utilize a semi-permeable membrane or material to regulate the release of active ingredients.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. transdermal nicotine patch
2. hormone replacement therapy patch
3. pain relief patch
4. motion sickness patch

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. adhesive bandage
6. lip balm
7. sunscreen lotion
8. antibacterial ointment
9. eye drops
10. nasal spray
11. inhaler
12. oral contraceptive pill
13. cough syrup
14. antacid tablet
15. topical cream
16. foot powder
17. hair dye
18. shampoo
19. deodorant stick
20. toothpaste
21. mouthwash
22. hand sanitizer
23. body lotion
24. facial mask

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
