Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that would be admissible as evidence in court but would create paradoxes if authenticated

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a photograph of a crime scene that shows the photographer committing the crime
2. a signed confession from a person who was proven to have been in a coma at the time of the crime
3. a video recording of a future event that has not yet occurred
4. a fingerprint on a weapon that matches a suspect who was confirmed to be in another country at the time of the crime

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a forged document
6. a witness testimony
7. a surveillance video
8. a DNA sample
9. a handwritten note
10. a weapon with fingerprints
11. a bloodstain
12. a voice recording
13. a security camera footage
14. a contract signed under duress
15. a piece of clothing with fibers matching the crime scene
16. a bank statement showing suspicious transactions
17. a text message exchange
18. a diary entry
19. a polygraph test result
20. a receipt from a store
21. a GPS tracking record
22. a photograph of a suspect
23. a piece of jewelry found at the crime scene
24. a video of a suspect fleeing the scene

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
