Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments that produce sound through electromagnetic induction and require an external power source to function

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fender Stratocaster electric guitar
2. Hammond B3 organ
3. Rhodes electric piano
4. Hohner Clavinet

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. acoustic guitar
6. grand piano
7. theremin
8. synthesizer
9. drum machine
10. violin
11. electronic keyboard
12. pipe organ
13. harpsichord
14. electric bass amplifier
15. microphone
16. electronic drum kit
17. mellotron
18. accordion
19. electric violin
20. MIDI controller
21. electric mandolin
22. digital piano
23. electronic wind instrument
24. electric ukulele

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
