Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or artifacts that incorporate materials derived from animals and are used in rituals, performances, or symbolic displays.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Feathered headdress
2. Ivory mask
3. Bone flute
4. Shell necklace

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Plastic mask
6. Wooden drum
7. Stone statue
8. Metal sword
9. Glass beads
10. Clay pot
11. Paper lantern
12. Silk robe
13. Bronze gong
14. Woolen scarf
15. Ceramic vase
16. Rubber ball
17. Wooden staff
18. Stone amulet
19. Plastic figurine
20. Glass chalice
21. Metal shield
22. Silk banner
23. Wicker basket
24. Paper fan

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
