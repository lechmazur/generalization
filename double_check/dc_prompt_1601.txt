Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices that use magnetic fields to determine position or orientation relative to Earth

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. compass
2. magnetometer
3. gyrocompass
4. fluxgate sensor

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. GPS device
6. accelerometer
7. barometer
8. altimeter
9. sextant
10. inclinometer
11. gyroscope
12. sonar
13. radar
14. thermometer
15. anemometer
16. odometer
17. tachometer
18. speedometer
19. hydrometer
20. pedometer
21. voltmeter
22. ammeter
23. spectrometer
24. barograph

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
