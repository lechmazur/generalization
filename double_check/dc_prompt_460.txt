Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures built by humans that were designed to facilitate communication with deities or spirits of the dead.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Oracle at Delphi
2. The Pyramid of Djoser
3. The Temple of Edfu
4. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Colosseum in Rome
6. The Eiffel Tower
7. The Great Wall of China
8. The Sydney Opera House
9. The Statue of Liberty
10. The Taj Mahal
11. The Louvre Museum
12. The Golden Gate Bridge
13. The Burj Khalifa
14. The Parthenon
15. The Sistine Chapel
16. The Hagia Sophia
17. The Pantheon in Rome
18. The Tower of London
19. The Kremlin
20. The White House
21. The Lincoln Memorial
22. The Washington Monument
23. The Arc de Triomphe
24. The Leaning Tower of Pisa

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
