Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that facilitate anonymous participation in decision-making processes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Secret ballot voting machines
2. Blockchain-based polling platforms
3. Anonymous feedback submission systems
4. Encrypted group decision software

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Public voting booths
6. Online petition websites
7. Social media polls
8. Hand-raising in meetings
9. Video conferencing platforms
10. Email surveys
11. Digital signature systems
12. Voice recognition software
13. Biometric scanners
14. Meeting scheduling apps
15. Project management tools
16. Discussion forums
17. Mobile voting apps
18. Electronic ballots
19. Digital suggestion boxes
20. Group chat applications
21. Decision matrix software
22. Consensus building platforms
23. Digital town halls
24. Online focus groups

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
