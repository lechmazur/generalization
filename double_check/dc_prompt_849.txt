Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural landmarks that serve as both tourist attractions and historical symbols of resistance or change.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Bastille
2. Berlin Wall
3. Independence Hall
4. Palace of Versailles

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Eiffel Tower
6. Statue of Liberty
7. Big Ben
8. Taj Mahal
9. Colosseum
10. Great Wall of China
11. Stonehenge
12. Acropolis
13. Notre Dame Cathedral
14. Sydney Opera House
15. Buckingham Palace
16. Kremlin
17. Empire State Building
18. Leaning Tower of Pisa
19. Westminster Abbey
20. Forbidden City
21. St. Peter's Basilica
22. Petra
23. Angkor Wat
24. Machu Picchu

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
