Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical events or objects that symbolize a significant turning point or transformation in cultural or political history.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The demolition of the Berlin Wall
2. The printing of the Gutenberg Bible
3. The Rosetta Stone
4. The signing of the Magna Carta

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the telephone
6. The first transatlantic flight
7. The discovery of penicillin
8. The construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza
9. The sinking of the Titanic
10. The painting of the Mona Lisa
11. The composition of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony
12. The writing of Hamlet
13. The launch of Sputnik
14. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
15. The end of World War II
16. The Civil Rights Movement
17. The invention of the internet
18. The first moon landing
19. The fall of the Roman Empire
20. The Black Death
21. The American Revolution
22. The French Revolution
23. The Industrial Revolution
24. The development of agriculture

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
