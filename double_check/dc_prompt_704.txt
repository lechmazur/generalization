Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures that rely on deliberate imbalance to function effectively

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The gyroscope in a smartphone
2. A bicycle's gearing system
3. The suspension system in a car
4. A progressive tax system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A balanced diet
6. A symmetrical building design
7. A fair coin toss
8. A perfectly balanced seesaw
9. A uniform distribution in statistics
10. A balanced chemical equation
11. A level playing field in sports
12. A balanced budget
13. A symmetrical flower
14. A balanced ecosystem
15. A fair judicial system
16. A balanced load in a washing machine
17. A symmetrical face
18. A balanced investment portfolio
19. A fair election process
20. A balanced chemical reaction
21. A symmetrical logo design
22. A balanced tree in computer science
23. A fair trade agreement
24. A balanced sound system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
