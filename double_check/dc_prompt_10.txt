Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or devices designed to reduce sensory input or perception, either temporarily or permanently, to enhance focus, comfort, or safety.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Earplugs used during sleep to block out noise
2. Light-blocking sleep masks
3. Noise-canceling headphones used in open office environments
4. White noise machines to mask distracting sounds

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Headphones for listening to music
6. Sunglasses to protect eyes from UV rays
7. Eye drops to relieve dryness
8. Air purifiers to improve air quality
9. Ergonomic chairs to enhance comfort while working
10. Blue light filters on screens to reduce eye strain
11. Meditation apps to aid in relaxation
12. Heating pads for muscle relaxation
13. Aromatherapy diffusers to create a calming environment
14. Sound amplifiers for hearing assistance
15. Weighted blankets for anxiety relief
16. Smart home devices to control lighting and temperature
17. Virtual reality headsets for immersive experiences
18. Adjustable desks for standing or sitting work positions
19. Noise-making toys for children
20. Flashlights for visibility in dark environments
21. Alarm clocks to wake up on time
22. Insulated mugs to keep beverages at desired temperatures
23. Portable fans for personal cooling
24. Waterproof phone cases for protection against water damage

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
