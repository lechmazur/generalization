Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Items handcrafted from recycled materials specifically for the purpose of providing shelter to stray animals.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A doghouse made from reclaimed wooden pallets
2. A cat shelter constructed from old tires
3. A birdhouse crafted from used plastic bottles
4. A rabbit hutch built from discarded shipping crates

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A birdhouse made from new wood
6. A dog bed sewn from recycled fabric
7. A cat tree made from new materials
8. A fish tank made from recycled glass
9. A kennel built from new lumber
10. A pet carrier made from recycled plastic
11. A dog leash made from repurposed materials
12. A cat toy made from recycled yarn
13. A bird feeder crafted from new metal
14. A rabbit run made from new wire mesh
15. A dog collar made from recycled rubber
16. A cat scratching post made from new sisal
17. A fish pond liner made from recycled materials
18. A bird perch made from new wood
19. A pet bed made from recycled foam
20. A dog toy made from repurposed fabric
21. A cat litter box made from recycled plastic
22. A bird cage made from new metal
23. A rabbit feeder made from recycled materials
24. A dog grooming brush made from recycled materials

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
