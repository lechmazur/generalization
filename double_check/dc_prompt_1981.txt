Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects associated with significant historical events that occurred in public parks

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a statue commemorating a civil rights march
2. a plaque marking the site of a historic speech
3. a monument dedicated to a peace treaty signing
4. a bench where a famous protest leader sat

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a painting depicting a historical event
6. a book about a significant historical event
7. a flag used during a historical battle
8. a piece of clothing worn by a historical figure
9. a photograph of a historical event
10. a document signed during a historical event
11. a weapon used in a historical conflict
12. a musical instrument played at a historical event
13. a vehicle used during a historical event
14. a piece of jewelry worn by a historical figure
15. a tool used in a historical event
16. a piece of furniture from a historical period
17. a map used during a historical event
18. a coin minted during a historical period
19. a piece of pottery from a historical era
20. a letter written by a historical figure
21. a piece of technology from a historical period
22. a toy from a historical era
23. a piece of architecture from a historical period
24. a film about a historical event

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
