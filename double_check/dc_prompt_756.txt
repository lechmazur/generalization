Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures who survived extreme isolation in the Arctic

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ada Blackjack - survived 2 years on Wrangel Island after expedition members died
2. Robert Bartlett - survived 37 days on ice after Karluk sank in 1914
3. Peter Freuchen - survived being trapped in an ice cave in Greenland
4. Valerian Albanov - survived 3 months after abandoning ship in Franz Josef Land

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ernest Shackleton
6. Roald Amundsen
7. Robert Falcon Scott
8. John Franklin
9. Richard Byrd
10. Alexander Mackenzie
11. Edmund Hillary
12. Matthew Henson
13. Robert Peary
14. Fridtjof Nansen
15. Douglas Mawson
16. Adolphus Greely
17. John Ross
18. James Clark Ross
19. Frederick Cook
20. Vilhjalmur Stefansson
21. Otto Sverdrup
22. Knud Rasmussen
23. Louise Boyd
24. Ann Bancroft

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
