Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional maritime navigation that rely on visual signals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Signal flags
2. Aldis lamp
3. Lighthouse
4. Navigation lights

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Sextant
6. Chronometer
7. Magnetic compass
8. Nautical chart
9. Lead line
10. Chip log
11. Traverse board
12. Parallel rule
13. Dividers
14. Pelorus
15. GPS receiver
16. Radar
17. Sonar
18. AIS transponder
19. Weather buoy
20. Anemometer
21. Barometer
22. Hygrometer
23. Radio direction finder
24. Emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
