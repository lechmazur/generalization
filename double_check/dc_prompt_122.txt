Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artworks or scientific concepts named after individuals who were not directly involved in their creation or discovery but are associated through historical, cultural, or symbolic significance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Eiffel Tower
2. The Pythagorean Theorem
3. The Mona Lisa
4. The Darwinian Theory of Evolution

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Newton's Laws of Motion
6. The Einstein's Theory of Relativity
7. The Wright Brothers' Airplane
8. The Ford Model T
9. The Gutenberg Printing Press
10. The Tesla Coil
11. The Curie's Radioactivity
12. The Edison's Light Bulb
13. The Bell's Telephone
14. The Marconi's Radio
15. The Pasteur's Germ Theory
16. The Mendel's Laws of Inheritance
17. The Galileo's Telescope
18. The Copernicus' Heliocentric Model
19. The Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
20. The Braille Writing System
21. The Morse Code
22. The Diesel Engine
23. The Watt's Steam Engine
24. The Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
