Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena that occur due to specific temperature thresholds

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Water boiling at 212째F at sea level
2. Frost forming on surfaces at 32째F
3. Iron melting at 2800째F
4. Oxygen liquefying at -297째F

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A thunderstorm
6. Northern lights
7. Wind patterns
8. Ocean currents
9. Volcanic eruptions
10. Earthquakes
11. Cloud formation
12. Rainbow appearance
13. Solar flares
14. Meteor showers
15. Humidity
16. Fog
17. Avalanches
18. Hurricanes
19. Tornadoes
20. Tidal waves
21. Geysers
22. Dust storms
23. Lightning strikes
24. Monsoons

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
