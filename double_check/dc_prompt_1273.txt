Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Techniques or tools used by virtuoso performers to enhance precision and creativity in their craft.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Use of a metronome to perfect timing in musical performances
2. Application of the Alexander Technique to improve posture and movement in dance
3. Implementation of loop pedals to create layered compositions in live music
4. Utilization of slow-motion video analysis to refine technique in figure skating

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Choosing the right paintbrush for a detailed artwork
6. Selecting a specific type of wood for crafting a musical instrument
7. Using a particular software for graphic design
8. Employing a certain type of camera lens for photography
9. Applying a specific cooking technique to enhance flavor
10. Using a special type of thread for embroidery
11. Choosing a particular brand of running shoes for marathon training
12. Selecting a specific type of yoga mat for practice
13. Using a certain type of fertilizer for gardening
14. Employing a specific method of meditation for relaxation
15. Choosing a particular type of fabric for sewing a dress
16. Using a specific brand of makeup for a theatrical performance
17. Selecting a certain type of clay for pottery
18. Applying a particular technique for brewing coffee
19. Using a specific type of pen for calligraphy
20. Choosing a particular type of fishing rod for angling
21. Employing a specific method of data analysis for research
22. Using a certain type of software for video editing
23. Selecting a specific type of bicycle for racing
24. Applying a particular technique for pruning plants

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
