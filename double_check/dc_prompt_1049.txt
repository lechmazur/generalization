Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or cultural elements that combine a utilitarian function with an aesthetic or emotional quality that contrasts with their primary purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A coffin shaped like a guitar
2. A tissue box cover designed as a miniature couch
3. A toilet paper holder that plays music
4. A fire extinguisher painted as a wine bottle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A decorative vase
6. A carved wooden spoon
7. A painted mailbox
8. A designer chair
9. An ornate picture frame
10. A colorful umbrella
11. A patterned coffee mug
12. A sculptural door handle
13. A decorated flower pot
14. An engraved pocket knife
15. A stained glass window
16. A mosaic birdbath
17. An embroidered tablecloth
18. A painted trash can
19. A jeweled clock
20. A carved bedpost
21. A decorated lunch box
22. An artistic doormat
23. A painted garden tool
24. A decorated storage box

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
