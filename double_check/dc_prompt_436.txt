Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Experiences or products marketed as offering a specialized, curated selection within a niche interest, but which ultimately rely on manufactured scarcity and performative connoisseurship to create an illusion of exclusivity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A monthly "rare spirits" subscription box that sends mass-produced liquors with custom labels
2. A "master coffee taster" course that teaches basic flavor identification using standard commercial beans
3. A "limited edition" sneaker release that artificially restricts inventory of regular materials and designs
4. A "craft chocolate appreciation" workshop using rebranded bulk chocolate from major manufacturers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A private wine cellar collection
6. An invitation-only supper club
7. A small-batch artisanal cheese shop
8. A members-only cigar lounge
9. A luxury watch boutique
10. A first-edition book collector's society
11. A vintage vinyl record store
12. A high-end tea ceremony experience
13. A rare whiskey tasting event
14. A designer fashion sample sale
15. An exclusive golf club membership
16. A premium sushi omakase restaurant
17. A limited-run art print series
18. A boutique perfume atelier
19. A private museum tour
20. A specialty coffee roaster
21. A custom suit tailor shop
22. A rare coin dealer
23. A luxury spa retreat
24. A gourmet food import store

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
