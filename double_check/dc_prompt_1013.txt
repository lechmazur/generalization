Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): architectural styles or movements that explicitly reject ornamentation in favor of functional simplicity and are named after their primary proponent or founder

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Corbusianism
2. Wrightianism
3. Miesianism
4. Loosianism

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Art Deco
6. Baroque
7. Gothic Revival
8. Rococo
9. Victorian
10. Beaux-Arts
11. Postmodernism
12. Brutalism
13. Deconstructivism
14. Expressionism
15. Futurism
16. High-Tech
17. International Style
18. Minimalism
19. Neoclassicism
20. Organic Architecture
21. Parametricism
22. Renaissance
23. Streamline Moderne
24. Usonian

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
