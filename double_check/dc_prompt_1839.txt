Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): large public buildings with specialized waste management systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Empire State Building
2. Beijing National Stadium
3. Dubai International Airport
4. Vatican Museums

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a local library
6. a suburban shopping mall
7. a small town community center
8. a neighborhood gym
9. a rural school
10. a city park
11. a residential apartment complex
12. a local grocery store
13. a small office building
14. a fast-food restaurant
15. a local post office
16. a small museum
17. a local fire station
18. a suburban hospital
19. a local police station
20. a small hotel
21. a neighborhood church
22. a local cinema
23. a small factory
24. a local zoo

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
