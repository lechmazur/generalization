Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices utilizing a cam and follower mechanism to translate rotational motion into linear motion for the purpose of securing or fastening.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. door lock deadbolt mechanism
2. vise grip locking pliers
3. toggle clamp fastener
4. cam lock furniture connector

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. ratchet wrench
6. belt tensioner pulley
7. window crank handle
8. bicycle brake lever
9. sewing machine
10. drill press
11. hydraulic jack
12. screwdriver
13. spring loaded hinge
14. combination lock
15. engine timing belt
16. garage door opener
17. socket wrench
18. door knob
19. padlock
20. zip tie
21. carabiner clip
22. velcro strap
23. bungee cord
24. chain link

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
