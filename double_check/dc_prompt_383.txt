Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products discontinued by their manufacturer due to containing a chemical later deemed carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Johnson's Baby Powder (original talc formula)
2. Scotchgard fabric protector (original PFOS formula)
3. Zonolite attic insulation
4. Zicam nasal gel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Crystal Pepsi
6. Google Glass
7. New Coke
8. Microsoft Zune
9. Colgate Kitchen Entrees
10. Ford Pinto
11. Clairol Touch of Yogurt Shampoo
12. Nike FuelBand
13. Amazon Fire Phone
14. Heinz Purple Ketchup
15. Samsung Galaxy Note 7
16. Wow! Chips
17. Betamax
18. McDonald's Arch Deluxe
19. DeLorean DMC-12
20. HD DVD
21. Segway
22. Tab Clear
23. WebTV
24. Cheetos Lip Balm

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
