Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional performances of poetry from non-Western cultures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. bamboo flute used in Chinese shi poetry recitation
2. talking drum for West African praise poetry
3. Aboriginal Australian didgeridoo for songline performances
4. Persian daf frame drum for ghazal accompaniment

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. microphone stand
6. sheet music stand
7. guitar pick
8. piano bench
9. conductor's baton
10. poetry anthology
11. stage spotlight
12. writing quill
13. leather-bound journal
14. reading glasses
15. acoustic guitar
16. violin bow
17. metronome
18. poetry slam scorecard
19. theater curtain
20. wooden stool
21. brass bell
22. ink brush
23. paper scroll
24. ceremonial mask

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
