Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient Egyptian symbols or motifs that were repurposed as luxury brand logos in the 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Juicy Couture's use of the cartouche
2. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's logo inspired by the Eye of Horus
3. Cartier's scarab beetle motif in jewelry
4. Byblos' stylized ankh logo

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Greek key pattern
6. Celtic knotwork
7. Art Deco designs
8. Fleur-de-lis symbol
9. Yin and yang symbol
10. Japanese cherry blossom motif
11. Native American dreamcatcher
12. Aztec calendar stone
13. Hermes' horse and carriage logo
14. Chanel's interlocking C's
15. Lacoste's crocodile logo
16. Versace's Medusa head logo
17. Burberry's equestrian knight logo
18. Yves Saint Laurent's monogram logo
19. Egyptian pyramids used in tourism logos
20. Pharaoh imagery in movie posters
21. Hieroglyphic fonts used in book covers
22. Anubis imagery in video games
23. Eye of Ra used in a tattoo design
24. Winged scarab beetle used as a decorative element

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
