Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Environmental stress responses that lead to visible changes in organisms' physical structures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Leaves of a plant curling due to drought conditions
2. Coral bleaching in response to increased water temperatures
3. Thicker fur in animals living in colder climates
4. Stunted growth in trees due to air pollution

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Migration of birds to warmer regions
6. Hibernation of bears during winter
7. Camouflage of chameleons to blend with their surroundings
8. Shedding of leaves by deciduous trees in autumn
9. Photosynthesis in plants
10. Bioluminescence in deep-sea creatures
11. Venom production in snakes
12. Web spinning by spiders
13. Pollination of flowers by bees
14. Regeneration of limbs in starfish
15. Symbiotic relationship between clownfish and anemones
16. Seasonal molting in birds
17. Photosynthetic algae living in coral tissues
18. Formation of pearls in oysters
19. Electric discharge in electric eels
20. Formation of ant hills
21. Use of echolocation by bats
22. Production of silk by silkworms
23. Formation of stalactites in caves
24. Growth of mushrooms after rain

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
