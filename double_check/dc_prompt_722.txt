Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that have undergone a transformation resulting in a significant change in their original purpose or meaning.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A caterpillar turning into a butterfly
2. A lump of coal transformed into a diamond
3. A seed growing into a tree
4. A tadpole metamorphosing into a frog

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A book being adapted into a movie
6. A building being renovated
7. A car being repainted
8. A company rebranding its logo
9. A computer being upgraded
10. A dress being altered
11. A factory being converted into a museum
12. A garden being redesigned
13. A house being remodeled
14. A law being amended
15. A machine being repaired
16. A painting being restored
17. A person changing their hairstyle
18. A phone being updated to a new model
19. A recipe being modified
20. A road being repaved
21. A song being remixed
22. A story being rewritten
23. A toy being refurbished
24. A website being redesigned

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
