Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures known for their strategic use of marriage alliances to consolidate power in 16th-century Europe

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Catherine de' Medici
2. Mary, Queen of Scots
3. Philip II of Spain
4. Margaret of Austria

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Napoleon Bonaparte
6. Julius Caesar
7. Queen Victoria
8. Charlemagne
9. Elizabeth I of England
10. Alexander the Great
11. Louis XIV of France
12. Henry VIII of England
13. Cleopatra
14. Genghis Khan
15. Joan of Arc
16. William the Conqueror
17. Marie Antoinette
18. Peter the Great
19. Queen Isabella of Castile
20. Frederick the Great
21. Leonardo da Vinci
22. Martin Luther
23. Galileo Galilei
24. Thomas More

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
