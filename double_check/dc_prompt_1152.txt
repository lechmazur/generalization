Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies or systems that use symbolic or encoded representations to interface between abstract concepts and physical reality.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. sheet music
2. Morse code
3. binary code
4. DNA sequencing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. sign language
6. traffic lights
7. cave paintings
8. hieroglyphics
9. emojis
10. road signs
11. flags
12. mathematical symbols
13. chemical formulas
14. musical instruments
15. calendars
16. maps
17. compasses
18. thermometers
19. clocks
20. pictographs
21. braille
22. semaphore signals
23. smoke signals
24. hand gestures

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
