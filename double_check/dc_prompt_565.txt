Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made objects designed to contain a pressurized gas or liquid, which were involved in widely publicized accidental explosions prior to 1970.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a steam boiler from the SS Sultana
2. a gas cylinder from the Cleveland East Ohio Gas explosion
3. a pressure vessel from the Texas City disaster
4. a propane tank from the 1968 Richmond, Indiana explosion

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a water balloon
6. a soda can
7. a fire extinguisher
8. a scuba tank
9. a bicycle tire
10. a helium balloon
11. a car radiator
12. a pressure cooker
13. a hot water heater
14. a gas pipeline
15. a fire hydrant
16. a garden hose
17. a propane grill
18. a firework
19. a diving bell
20. a hydraulic press
21. a steam engine
22. a water tower
23. a fuel tank
24. a vacuum chamber

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
