Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices that integrate multiple distinct functionalities into a single wearable unit for health monitoring

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A smartwatch that tracks heart rate, sleep patterns, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature.
2. A ring that monitors blood pressure, ECG, and activity levels.
3. A earbud that measures heart rate variability, stress levels, and body temperature while also functioning as a hearing aid.
4. A patch worn on the arm that continuously monitors glucose levels, hydration, and electrolyte balance.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A heart rate monitor chest strap.
6. A blood pressure cuff.
7. A fitness tracker that only counts steps and calories burned.
8. A sleep tracker mat placed under the mattress.
9. A smart scale that measures weight and body composition.
10. A pulse oximeter.
11. A blood glucose meter.
12. A thermometer.
13. A smartwatch that only displays notifications from a smartphone.
14. A pair of headphones with noise cancellation.
15. A smart clothing item that monitors posture.
16. A wearable GPS tracker.
17. A medical alert bracelet.
18. A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that requires a separate receiver.
19. A smart pill dispenser.
20. A digital stethoscope.
21. An insulin pump.
22. A CPAP machine.
23. A smart contact lens that monitors intraocular pressure.
24. A wearable air purifier.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
