Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological advancements or scientific breakthroughs that were initially met with skepticism but later revolutionized their respective fields.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ignaz Semmelweis's handwashing protocol
2. Continental drift theory
3. Heliocentrism
4. Pasteurization

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Steam engine
6. Printing press
7. Penicillin
8. World Wide Web
9. Telephone
10. Electric light bulb
11. Wright brothers' airplane
12. Vaccination
13. Microscope
14. X-ray machine
15. DNA structure
16. Quantum mechanics
17. Theory of relativity
18. Periodic table
19. Cell theory
20. Radio waves
21. Atomic theory
22. Evolution
23. Transistor
24. Microprocessor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
