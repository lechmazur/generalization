Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical spaces designed to facilitate a specific preparatory activity immediately preceding a main event or performance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A green room in a theater
2. A locker room in a sports stadium
3. A backstage area in a concert venue
4. A pit stop area in a racing circuit

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A classroom in a school
6. A kitchen in a restaurant
7. A waiting room in a doctor's office
8. A conference room in an office building
9. A gymnasium in a fitness center
10. A rehearsal space in a dance studio
11. A dressing room in a clothing store
12. A lounge area in an airport
13. A study room in a library
14. A workshop in a factory
15. A break room in a workplace
16. A meditation room in a wellness center
17. A control room in a power plant
18. A recording studio in a music production facility
19. A boardroom in a corporate office
20. A laboratory in a research institute
21. A fitting room in a tailor shop
22. A briefing room in a police station
23. A reading room in a public library
24. A training room in a martial arts dojo

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
