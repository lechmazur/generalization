Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Polyhedra that can be constructed by truncating all vertices of a Platonic solid such that the resulting faces are regular polygons of two different types.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Truncated tetrahedron
2. Truncated cube
3. Truncated octahedron
4. Truncated icosahedron

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cuboctahedron
6. Icosidodecahedron
7. Rhombicuboctahedron
8. Rhombicosidodecahedron
9. Snub cube
10. Snub dodecahedron
11. Tetrahedron
12. Cube
13. Octahedron
14. Dodecahedron
15. Icosahedron
16. Triangular prism
17. Square pyramid
18. Pentagonal prism
19. Hexagonal prism
20. Truncated square pyramid
21. Small rhombicuboctahedron
22. Great rhombicuboctahedron
23. Small rhombicosidodecahedron
24. Great rhombicosidodecahedron

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
