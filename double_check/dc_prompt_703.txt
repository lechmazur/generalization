Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional garments that incorporate a sash or belt as a functional and decorative element

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The obi worn with a kimono in Japanese culture
2. The faja used in traditional Colombian attire
3. The cummerbund worn with a sherwani in South Asian weddings
4. The kilt belt used in Scottish Highland dress

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A scarf worn loosely around the neck
6. A necklace as a piece of jewelry
7. A headband used in sports
8. A wristwatch as an accessory
9. A brooch pinned to a jacket
10. A hat worn for sun protection
11. A pair of gloves for warmth
12. A tie worn with a business suit
13. A bracelet as a fashion statement
14. A pair of earrings
15. A pocket square in a suit jacket
16. A shawl draped over the shoulders
17. A ring worn on a finger
18. A pair of sunglasses
19. A hair clip for styling
20. A backpack for carrying items
21. A pair of shoes
22. A purse or handbag
23. A belt buckle as a decorative item
24. A pair of socks

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
