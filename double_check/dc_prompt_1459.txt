Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Extinct animals that were named after living celebrities during the 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a dinosaur named after Elvis Presley
2. a prehistoric bird named after Marilyn Monroe
3. a fossilized mammal named after John Lennon
4. an ancient reptile named after Audrey Hepburn

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a living bird named after a scientist
6. a modern insect named after a fictional character
7. a recently discovered fish named after a politician
8. a plant species named after a historical figure
9. a newly identified fungus named after a musician
10. a living reptile named after a celebrity chef
11. a modern mammal named after a famous athlete
12. a recently extinct bird named after a poet
13. a fossilized plant named after a philosopher
14. a living amphibian named after a painter
15. a modern crustacean named after a composer
16. a recently discovered spider named after a filmmaker
17. a living mollusk named after a novelist
18. a modern arachnid named after a playwright
19. a recently extinct insect named after a sculptor
20. a fossilized fish named after a mathematician
21. a living mammal named after a historian
22. a modern bird named after a geologist
23. a recently discovered reptile named after an astronomer
24. a living amphibian named after a chemist

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
