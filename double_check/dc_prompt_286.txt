Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer electronic devices released in the 1990s that used a physical cartridge or disc-based storage medium for software or data and had a built-in monochrome LCD screen.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Game Boy
2. Game Boy Pocket
3. Game Boy Light
4. Game Boy Color

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Sega Genesis
6. PlayStation
7. Nintendo 64
8. Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)
9. Atari Jaguar
10. Neo Geo AES
11. Commodore 64
12. Apple Newton
13. Palm Pilot
14. Discman
15. Walkman
16. Dreamcast
17. Virtual Boy
18. Atari Lynx
19. Sega Game Gear
20. TurboExpress
21. 3DO Interactive Multiplayer
22. Philips CD-i
23. Neo Geo Pocket Color
24. WonderSwan Color

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
