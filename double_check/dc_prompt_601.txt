Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Polyhedra that can be constructed by truncating all vertices of a regular dodecahedron such that the original pentagonal faces become decagons.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A polyhedron with 12 decagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces.
2. A polyhedron with 32 faces, where 12 faces are decagons and 20 faces are hexagons.
3. A polyhedron resulting from truncating the vertices of a dodecahedron, yielding 12 decagonal faces and 20 hexagonal faces.
4. A polyhedron with 12 decagonal faces surrounded by 20 hexagonal faces, formed by truncating a dodecahedron.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A polyhedron with only hexagonal faces.
6. A polyhedron formed by truncating the vertices of a cube.
7. A polyhedron with pentagonal and hexagonal faces.
8. A polyhedron with only triangular faces.
9. A polyhedron formed by truncating the vertices of an octahedron.
10. A polyhedron with square and octagonal faces.
11. A polyhedron with only pentagonal faces.
12. A polyhedron formed by truncating the vertices of a tetrahedron.
13. A polyhedron with hexagonal and octagonal faces.
14. A polyhedron with only octagonal faces.
15. A polyhedron formed by truncating the vertices of an icosahedron.
16. A polyhedron with triangular and hexagonal faces.
17. A polyhedron with square and hexagonal faces.
18. A polyhedron with only square faces.
19. A polyhedron formed by truncating the vertices of a cuboctahedron.
20. A polyhedron with pentagonal and decagonal faces.
21. A polyhedron with triangular and pentagonal faces.
22. A polyhedron with hexagonal and decagonal faces.
23. A polyhedron formed by truncating the vertices of a rhombicuboctahedron.
24. A polyhedron with only decagonal faces.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
