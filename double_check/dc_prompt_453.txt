Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or depictions of objects that incorporate a stylized, swirling representation of water, specifically inspired by traditional Japanese woodblock prints of ocean waves.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A ceramic teapot with a glazed surface depicting swirling, stylized waves in shades of blue and white, reminiscent of Hokusai's "The Great Wave off Kanagawa."
2. A silk scarf with a repeating pattern of simplified, curved lines representing ocean waves, inspired by the ukiyo-e art style.
3. A metal sculpture of a stylized wave crest, with swirling, layered forms that evoke the movement of water in a Japanese woodblock print.
4. A wooden wall panel carved with a dynamic, swirling design representing crashing waves, inspired by traditional Japanese wave motifs.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of a realistic ocean scene.
6. A photograph of waves crashing on a beach.
7. A seashell.
8. A piece of driftwood.
9. A surfboard.
10. A fishing boat.
11. A lighthouse.
12. A rain cloud.
13. A waterfall.
14. A river.
15. A swimming pool.
16. A glass of water.
17. A teardrop.
18. A spiral staircase.
19. A swirl of paint.
20. A fingerprint.
21. A Japanese fan with a cherry blossom design.
22. A kimono with a floral pattern.
23. A katana (Japanese sword).
24. A bonsai tree.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
