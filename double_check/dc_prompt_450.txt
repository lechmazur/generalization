Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products first advertised on television during the original airing of the Super Bowl

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ford Mustang
2. Xerox 914 copier
3. Goodyear Double Eagle tire
4. Schlitz beer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Coca-Cola
6. Nike shoes
7. Budweiser beer
8. McDonald's Big Mac
9. Chevrolet Camaro
10. Apple iPhone
11. Pepsi
12. Doritos
13. Toyota Camry
14. Tide laundry detergent
15. Snickers candy bar
16. Gillette razor
17. Honda Civic
18. Nintendo Wii
19. Samsung Galaxy phone
20. Maybelline mascara
21. Crest toothpaste
22. Head and Shoulders shampoo
23. Bounty paper towels
24. Charmin toilet paper

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
