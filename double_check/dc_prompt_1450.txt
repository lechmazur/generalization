Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Beverages that were accidentally discovered by someone forgetting about or neglecting their ingredients during preparation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Champagne
2. Ice wine
3. Roquefort cheese
4. Chocolate chip cookies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Orange juice
6. Espresso
7. Green tea
8. Hot chocolate
9. Apple cider
10. Milkshake
11. Herbal tea
12. Fruit smoothie
13. Latte
14. Energy drink
15. Ginger ale
16. Root beer
17. Matcha
18. Chai tea
19. Cola
20. Mineral water
21. Sports drink
22. Tomato juice
23. Bubble tea
24. Buttermilk

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
