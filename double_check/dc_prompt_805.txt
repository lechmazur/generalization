Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artistic expressions that juxtapose opulence with simplicity to create a striking contrast

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A minimalist room with a single, extravagant chandelier
2. A simple white dress adorned with intricate gold embroidery
3. A plain ceramic bowl with a lavish gold rim
4. A rustic wooden table set with fine china and crystal glassware

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A luxurious mansion with ornate decorations throughout
6. A simple, unadorned wooden chair
7. A painting of a lavish banquet scene
8. A plain white t-shirt
9. An elaborate, detailed sculpture
10. A minimalist painting with only a single color
11. A grand opera performance
12. A simple black and white photograph
13. A richly decorated cathedral
14. A plain, undecorated pottery vase
15. A detailed, intricate tapestry
16. A simple, unadorned stone statue
17. A lavishly decorated ballroom
18. A plain, unembellished notebook
19. A complex, multi-layered symphony
20. A simple, single-note melody
21. A richly illustrated manuscript
22. A plain, unadorned wooden bench
23. A detailed, ornate piece of jewelry
24. A simple, unadorned clay pot

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
