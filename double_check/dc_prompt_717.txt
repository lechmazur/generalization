Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations that integrate ancient engineering principles with modern digital technology to enhance environmental sustainability.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A smart irrigation system that uses algorithms based on ancient qanat water management principles to optimize water distribution in modern agriculture.
2. A building ventilation system inspired by Roman hypocaust heating that utilizes digital sensors and actuators to regulate airflow and temperature, minimizing energy consumption.
3. A passive cooling system for urban areas that incorporates principles of windcatchers found in traditional Persian architecture, combined with digital simulations to maximize efficiency.
4. A bio-filtration system for wastewater treatment that mimics the natural filtration processes of ancient terraced farming, enhanced with real-time monitoring and data analysis.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A solar-powered desalination plant.
6. A wind turbine farm.
7. A hydroelectric dam.
8. A geothermal power plant.
9. An electric vehicle charging station.
10. A smart home energy management system.
11. A green roof on a modern building.
12. A vertical farm using hydroponics.
13. A rainwater harvesting system.
14. A composting toilet.
15. A drone used for reforestation.
16. 3D-printed houses made from sustainable materials.
17. An app for tracking carbon footprint.
18. Biodegradable plastic packaging.
19. A system for recycling electronic waste.
20. Using AI to predict weather patterns for agriculture.
21. A mobile app for promoting sustainable living practices.
22. A community garden project.
23. A program for educating children about environmental conservation.
24. Using blockchain technology for carbon trading.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
