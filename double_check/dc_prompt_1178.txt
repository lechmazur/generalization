Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural or artistic works that incorporate folklore or mythology into modern or futuristic settings.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Neil Gaiman's "American Gods"
2. Rick Riordan's "Percy Jackson and the Olympians" series
3. Studio Ghibli's "Spirited Away"
4. Marvel's "Thor: Ragnarok"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings"
6. George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire"
7. Homer's "The Iliad"
8. William Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
9. Disney's "The Lion King"
10. James Cameron's "Avatar"
11. J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" series
12. H.G. Wells' "The War of the Worlds"
13. Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein"
14. George Orwell's "1984"
15. Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series
16. Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
17. Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"
18. Stephen King's "The Shining"
19. Arthur Conan Doyle's "Sherlock Holmes" stories
20. Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express"
21. Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code"
22. Michael Crichton's "Jurassic Park"
23. F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby"
24. Emily BrontÃ«'s "Wuthering Heights"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
