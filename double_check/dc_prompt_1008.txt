Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies or systems that integrate human creativity with automated processes to enhance performance or output.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. AI-assisted music composition software
2. Generative design tools for architecture
3. Collaborative robotics in manufacturing
4. AI-enhanced video editing platforms

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a manual typewriter
6. a standalone calculator
7. a traditional paintbrush
8. a handwritten journal
9. a mechanical clock
10. a vinyl record player
11. a non-digital camera
12. a manual sewing machine
13. a chalkboard
14. a paper map
15. a standalone GPS device
16. a basic landline telephone
17. a traditional compass
18. a manual car transmission
19. a non-smart thermostat
20. a standalone printer
21. a basic flashlight
22. a manual lawnmower
23. a non-digital thermometer
24. a standalone radio

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
