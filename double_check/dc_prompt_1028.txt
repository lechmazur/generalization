Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): phenomena or systems that exhibit extreme or paradoxical behavior under specific conditions, often defying conventional expectations or norms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Superfluidity: Liquid helium at extremely low temperatures flows without any viscosity, defying the typical behavior of fluids.
2. Mpemba effect: Hot water can freeze faster than cold water under certain conditions, contradicting common intuition.
3. Braess's paradox: Adding extra capacity to a network, such as a road network, can counterintuitively reduce overall flow and increase congestion.
4. St. Petersburg paradox: A theoretical lottery game with infinite expected value, yet people are unwilling to pay a large amount to play, highlighting the limitations of expected value in decision-making.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A pendulum swinging with simple harmonic motion
6. A ball rolling down an inclined plane
7. Water boiling at 100 degrees Celsius
8. A metal expanding when heated
9. Light refracting through a prism
10. A magnet attracting iron filings
11. A battery powering a circuit
12. A plant growing towards sunlight
13. An animal adapting to its environment
14. A chemical reaction reaching equilibrium
15. Erosion of rocks by wind and water
16. The formation of clouds
17. The tides caused by the moon's gravity
18. The Earth orbiting the Sun
19. A computer processing information
20. A car accelerating at a constant rate
21. A plane flying at a constant altitude
22. A ship floating on water
23. A building standing upright
24. A bridge supporting weight

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
