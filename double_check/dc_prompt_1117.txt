Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that emit or detect specific types of radiation, either naturally or through human intervention, and are used to measure or interact with their environment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Geiger counter
2. Infrared thermometer
3. Smoke detector
4. Radium watch dial

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Light bulb
6. Television screen
7. Radio antenna
8. Solar panel
9. Microwave oven
10. Camera flash
11. X-ray machine
12. Laser pointer
13. Fluorescent paint
14. Glow stick
15. Night vision goggles
16. UV sterilizer
17. Motion sensor
18. Radar gun
19. Satellite dish
20. Cell phone tower
21. Lightning rod
22. Metal detector
23. Electric fence
24. Barcode scanner

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
