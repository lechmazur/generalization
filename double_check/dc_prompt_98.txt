Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Stories or concepts that involve the manipulation or perception of hidden dimensions or realities beyond the ordinary senses.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a character who discovers they can see through walls into parallel universes
2. a story about a device that allows users to perceive time as a physical dimension
3. a concept where dreams are revealed to be glimpses of alternate realities
4. a narrative about a hidden world accessible only through specific sound frequencies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a detective solving a murder mystery
6. a scientist studying the behavior of light
7. a person experiencing déjà vu
8. a story about a haunted house
9. a character who can read minds
10. a tale about a magical portal to another world
11. a narrative involving time travel to the past
12. a story about a person who can predict the future
13. a concept where memories can be erased or altered
14. a character who can communicate with animals
15. a story about a hidden treasure map
16. a narrative involving a secret society
17. a tale about a person who can control the weather
18. a story about a character who can become invisible
19. a concept where emotions are visible as colors
20. a narrative about a person who can teleport
21. a story about a character who can manipulate dreams
22. a tale about a person who can stop time
23. a narrative involving a parallel universe where history is different
24. a story about a character who can see ghosts

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
