Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that integrate real-time data processing with user interaction to optimize decision-making in dynamic environments.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A traffic management system that adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic flow and pedestrian interactions.
2. An emergency response platform that processes real-time data from multiple sources to guide first responders' actions in the field.
3. A smart grid system that uses real-time energy consumption data and user feedback to optimize electricity distribution.
4. A dynamic pricing engine for ride-sharing services that adjusts fares based on real-time demand and user behavior patterns.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weather forecasting app that provides real-time updates but does not allow user interaction.
6. A fitness tracker that collects real-time data but only displays it without influencing user decisions.
7. A stock trading platform that uses historical data for analysis but does not process data in real-time.
8. A social media platform that allows user interaction but does not use real-time data to optimize content delivery.
9. A home automation system that responds to user commands but does not process real-time environmental data.
10. A virtual reality game that processes real-time data but does not involve decision-making in a dynamic environment.
11. A navigation app that provides real-time traffic updates but does not allow users to influence route optimization.
12. A smart thermostat that adjusts temperature based on real-time data but does not involve user interaction for decision-making.
13. A health monitoring system that collects real-time data but does not integrate it with user interaction for decision-making.
14. A retail inventory management system that uses real-time data but does not involve user interaction to optimize stock levels.
15. A video streaming service that uses real-time data to adjust video quality but does not involve user interaction for decision-making.
16. A smart city surveillance system that processes real-time data but does not allow user interaction to influence security measures.
17. A logistics tracking system that provides real-time updates but does not involve user interaction to optimize delivery routes.
18. A financial dashboard that displays real-time market data but does not allow user interaction to influence investment decisions.
19. A smart agriculture system that uses real-time data to monitor crop health but does not involve user interaction for decision-making.
20. A remote monitoring system for industrial equipment that collects real-time data but does not involve user interaction for maintenance decisions.
21. A real-time analytics platform that processes data but does not integrate user interaction to optimize business strategies.
22. A smart home security system that uses real-time data to detect intrusions but does not involve user interaction for decision-making.
23. A traffic information system that provides real-time data but does not allow user interaction to influence traffic flow management.
24. A real-time translation app that processes spoken language but does not involve user interaction to optimize translation accuracy.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
