Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Representations of a coming-of-age ritual or ceremony in a work of art created before 1950

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain
2. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
3. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
4. Great Expectations by Charles Dickens

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci
6. The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh
7. The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dalí
8. The Scream by Edvard Munch
9. The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci
10. The Thinker by Auguste Rodin
11. The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli
12. The Night Watch by Rembrandt
13. The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck
14. The School of Athens by Raphael
15. The Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer
16. The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo
17. The Hay Wain by John Constable
18. The Kiss by Gustav Klimt
19. The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch
20. The Raft of the Medusa by Théodore Géricault
21. The Death of Socrates by Jacques-Louis David
22. The Liberty Leading the People by Eugène Delacroix
23. The Oath of the Horatii by Jacques-Louis David
24. The Swing by Jean-Honoré Fragonard

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
