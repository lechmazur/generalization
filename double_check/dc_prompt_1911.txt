Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Reflective surfaces used in folklore and mythology to reveal hidden truths or future events

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a magical mirror that shows the true nature of a person's soul
2. a sacred pool used by a seer to glimpse future events
3. a polished shield that reveals hidden dangers when gazed upon
4. a crystal ball used by a witch to foresee the fate of a kingdom

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a compass that always points to true north
6. a lantern that glows brighter in the presence of danger
7. a golden apple that grants eternal youth
8. a talking bird that reveals secrets of the past
9. a magical harp that plays music to calm storms
10. a stone that glows when held by a worthy hero
11. a cloak that renders the wearer invisible
12. a sword that can cut through any material
13. a book that writes itself with future knowledge
14. a ring that grants the wearer immense strength
15. a staff that controls the weather
16. a potion that grants the ability to speak with animals
17. a map that shows the location of hidden treasures
18. a flute that summons spirits from the underworld
19. a crown that bestows wisdom upon its wearer
20. a key that unlocks any door, even magical ones
21. a feather that allows the holder to fly
22. a drum whose beats can summon armies
23. a necklace that protects the wearer from curses
24. a chalice that never runs out of water

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
