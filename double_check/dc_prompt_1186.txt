Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical artifacts or events that incorporate circular symbolism to represent cycles of time, power, or cosmic order.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Aztec Sun Stone calendar
2. Celtic Cross at Killamery
3. Buddhist Wheel of Dharma
4. Mayan Long Count calendar disk

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge
6. Egyptian scarab amulet
7. Roman coin
8. Viking shield
9. Chinese bronze mirror
10. Persian carpet medallion
11. Greek amphora
12. Native American dreamcatcher
13. Japanese temple bell
14. African tribal mask
15. Incan gold disc
16. Byzantine mosaic
17. Indian mandala painting
18. Mesopotamian seal cylinder
19. Norse runestone
20. Australian Aboriginal dot painting
21. Phoenician bracelet
22. Olmec jade pendant
23. Tibetan prayer wheel
24. Saxon burial disc brooch

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
