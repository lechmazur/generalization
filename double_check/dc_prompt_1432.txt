Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Circular or spiral patterns used in traditional African textiles and jewelry that represent specific cultural narratives or social status

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ankara fabric with circular motifs
2. Zulu beadwork with spiral designs
3. Kente cloth featuring concentric circles
4. Maasai jewelry with coiled wire patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a striped kente cloth
6. a mud cloth with geometric shapes
7. a batik fabric with floral patterns
8. a dashiki with abstract designs
9. a tie-dye shirt with random patterns
10. a woven basket with zigzag patterns
11. a beaded necklace with linear patterns
12. a mud cloth with square motifs
13. a tapestry with animal prints
14. a kente cloth with diagonal lines
15. a batik fabric with animal motifs
16. a tie-dye fabric with starburst patterns
17. a woven mat with checkerboard patterns
18. a beaded bracelet with triangular designs
19. a mud cloth with cross patterns
20. a tapestry with landscape scenes
21. a kente cloth with vertical stripes
22. a batik fabric with leaf patterns
23. a tie-dye fabric with stripe patterns
24. a woven basket with diamond shapes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
