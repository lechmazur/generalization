Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Festivals that celebrate cultural heritage through music and dance, originating from island nations in the Caribbean.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Carnival of Trinidad and Tobago
2. Junkanoo Festival in The Bahamas
3. Crop Over Festival in Barbados
4. Vincentian Carnival in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mardi Gras in New Orleans
6. Rio de Janeiro Carnival in Brazil
7. Oktoberfest in Germany
8. Diwali Festival of Lights in India
9. Chinese New Year Celebrations
10. Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland
11. La Tomatina Festival in Spain
12. Day of the Dead in Mexico
13. Holland Festival in the Netherlands
14. Sundance Film Festival in the United States
15. Notting Hill Carnival in London
16. Sydney Festival in Australia
17. Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the United States
18. Glastonbury Festival in England
19. Hanami Cherry Blossom Festivals in Japan
20. St. Patrick's Day Celebrations in Ireland
21. La Mercè Festival in Barcelona, Spain
22. Fiesta San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain
23. Cannes Film Festival in France
24. Venice Carnival in Italy

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
