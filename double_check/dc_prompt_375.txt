Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geologic formations composed primarily of igneous rock that contain a natural basin or depression which holds water at least seasonally.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Crater Lake in Oregon
2. Lake Taupo in New Zealand
3. Lake Taal in Philippines
4. Lake Askja in Iceland

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Great Salt Lake
6. Lake Superior
7. Limestone sinkhole pond
8. Granite quarry pool
9. Mount Fuji
10. Basalt columns
11. Old Faithful geyser
12. Marble canyon
13. Desert oasis
14. Glacial lake
15. River oxbow
16. Sandstone arch
17. Lava tube
18. Mountain tarn
19. Pumice field
20. Obsidian dome
21. Dry lake bed
22. Hot spring
23. Fjord
24. Gabbro outcrop

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
