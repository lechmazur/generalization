Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer electronics released in 1997 that used a physical spinning disc for data storage

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sony PlayStation
2. Panasonic DVD-A110
3. Pioneer DVL-909
4. Philips CD-i 450

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Nintendo 64
6. Apple iPod Classic
7. Sega Saturn
8. Sony Walkman WM-EX672
9. Xbox 360
10. Nintendo GameCube
11. Sony MiniDisc Player MZ-1
12. Commodore 64
13. Apple iMac G3
14. Atari Jaguar
15. Sony PlayStation 2
16. Toshiba Satellite 220CDS
17. Nintendo Wii
18. Sega Dreamcast
19. Sony PlayStation 3
20. Microsoft Zune
21. Pioneer CDJ-500
22. IBM ThinkPad 380XD
23. Creative Nomad Jukebox
24. Panasonic 3DO

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
