Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Moments when a single mechanical click or sound marks the transition from anticipation to action

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the click of a camera shutter capturing a decisive moment
2. the sound of a gun's safety being switched off before firing
3. the click of a pen before writing a signature
4. the snap of a seatbelt buckle before driving

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the hum of a car engine starting
6. the beep of a microwave finishing
7. the ringing of an alarm clock
8. the sound of a door creaking open
9. the clinking of glasses during a toast
10. the rustling of leaves in the wind
11. the ticking of a clock
12. the sound of a key turning in a lock
13. the whirring of a blender
14. the crackling of a campfire
15. the sound of a phone vibrating
16. the chirping of birds at dawn
17. the sound of footsteps on gravel
18. the clatter of dishes in a sink
19. the sound of a train whistle
20. the buzz of a fluorescent light
21. the sound of a zipper being pulled
22. the thud of a book closing
23. the sound of a faucet dripping
24. the sound of a balloon popping

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
