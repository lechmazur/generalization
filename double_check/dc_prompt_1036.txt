Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): structures or systems that were initially designed for a specific purpose but later repurposed for a completely different function, with the original design still influencing their current use

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cardboard egg cartons used for soundproofing in recording studios
2. Old tires used as building materials for artificial reefs
3. Shipping containers converted into housing units
4. Discarded floppy disks used as crafting materials for bags or jewelry

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A butter knife used to tighten a loose screw
6. A CD used as a coaster
7. A newspaper used to wrap fish and chips
8. A plastic bottle used as a plant pot
9. A sock used as a dust cloth
10. A brick used as a doorstop
11. A coat hanger used as a makeshift antenna
12. A teacup used as a pen holder
13. A wine cork used as a pin cushion
14. A tin can used as a pencil holder
15. A ladder used as a bookshelf
16. A pallet used as a garden bed
17. A bathtub used as a cattle trough
18. A piano used as a bar
19. A car tire swing
20. A milk crate used as a storage box
21. A dresser drawer used as a shelf
22. A suitcase used as a coffee table
23. A wheelbarrow used as a planter
24. A bed frame used as a trellis

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
