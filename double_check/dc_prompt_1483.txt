Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient burial sites that were later converted into tourist attractions featuring electric lighting systems before 1950

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Catacombs of Paris, France
2. Valley of the Kings, Egypt
3. Newgrange, Ireland
4. Lascaux Caves, France

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge, England
6. Machu Picchu, Peru
7. Angkor Wat, Cambodia
8. Petra, Jordan
9. Chichen Itza, Mexico
10. Great Wall of China
11. Colosseum, Italy
12. Easter Island statues
13. Acropolis of Athens, Greece
14. Taj Mahal, India
15. Pompeii, Italy
16. Teotihuacan, Mexico
17. Borobudur, Indonesia
18. Alhambra, Spain
19. Hagia Sophia, Turkey
20. Moai statues, Easter Island
21. GÃ¶bekli Tepe, Turkey
22. Palmyra, Syria
23. Bagan, Myanmar
24. Mesa Verde, USA

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
