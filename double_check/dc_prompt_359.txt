Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Representations of authority or power that utilize abstracted or distorted facial features to convey a specific emotional or spiritual state.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A tribal mask with exaggerated, sharp angles and a gaping mouth, representing the ferocity of a war god.
2. A statue of a political leader with elongated, smooth features and a serene expression, symbolizing wisdom and composure.
3. A painting of a demonic figure with swirling, distorted eyes and a grotesque grin, evoking fear and malevolence.
4. An icon of a saint with enlarged, upward-gazing eyes and a gentle smile, conveying piety and spiritual transcendence.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A photograph of a king wearing a crown.
6. A police officer's badge.
7. A judge's gavel.
8. A military uniform.
9. A superhero with exaggerated muscles.
10. A cartoon villain with a scowling face.
11. A roaring lion.
12. A snarling wolf.
13. A cowering dog.
14. A majestic eagle.
15. A portrait of a queen with a regal pose.
16. A sculpture of a muscular athlete.
17. A painting of a weeping woman.
18. A photograph of a smiling child.
19. A drawing of a frowning man.
20. A film still of an actor expressing anger.
21. A theatrical mask depicting sadness.
22. A religious icon with a halo.
23. A political cartoon of a leader with a large nose.
24. A caricature of a celebrity with exaggerated features.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
