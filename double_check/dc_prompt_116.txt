Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): technologies or systems that rely on periodic synchronization to maintain functionality or coherence

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Network Time Protocol (NTP)
2. Distributed databases
3. Version control systems
4. GPS satellite systems

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bluetooth headphones
6. Smartphone apps
7. Electric cars
8. Home Wi-Fi routers
9. Streaming services
10. Smart thermostats
11. Voice assistants
12. Digital cameras
13. Smartwatches
14. Online banking systems
15. Video game consoles
16. Cloud storage services
17. Fitness trackers
18. Electric scooters
19. Smart TVs
20. 3D printers
21. Wireless charging pads
22. Home security systems
23. Digital photo frames
24. Smart light bulbs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
