Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): literary works or philosophical concepts that explore the tension between determinism and free will through ambiguous or unresolved conclusions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The ending of Albert Camus' "The Stranger," where Meursault's acceptance of his fate leaves the reader questioning whether his actions were predetermined or a result of his own free will.
2. The conclusion of Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground," where the narrator's final reflections on his actions and their inevitability blur the lines between determinism and free will.
3. The ambiguous ending of Jean-Paul Sartre's play "No Exit," where the characters' entrapment and interactions suggest a tension between their predetermined fates and their choices.
4. The unresolved conclusion of Philip K. Dick's "Ubik," where the shifting realities and characters' actions leave the reader pondering the balance between destiny and personal agency.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The clear resolution of moral choices in C.S. Lewis's "The Chronicles of Narnia."
6. The deterministic world of George Orwell's "1984," where free will is systematically suppressed.
7. The exploration of fate versus free will in Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex," with a clear tragic resolution.
8. The theme of predestination in John Calvin's theological works.
9. The concept of karma in Hindu philosophy, suggesting a cycle of cause and effect.
10. The clear moral choices and their consequences in Aesop's fables.
11. The deterministic view of human behavior in B.F. Skinner's behaviorism.
12. The exploration of free will in Milton's "Paradise Lost," with a clear resolution in the characters' choices.
13. The concept of fate in Greek mythology, where gods often dictate human destinies.
14. The clear resolution of moral dilemmas in Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice."
15. The deterministic nature of the universe in Isaac Newton's laws of physics.
16. The exploration of free will in the context of divine providence in Augustine's "Confessions."
17. The clear moral choices and their consequences in Shakespeare's "Hamlet."
18. The deterministic view of human behavior in Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory.
19. The concept of predestination in the theology of St. Augustine.
20. The clear resolution of moral choices in Charles Dickens's "A Tale of Two Cities."
21. The exploration of fate versus free will in Thomas Hardy's "Tess of the d'Urbervilles," with a clear tragic resolution.
22. The deterministic view of human behavior in the context of social conditioning in Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World."
23. The concept of fate in Norse mythology, where the Norns dictate the destinies of gods and humans.
24. The clear moral choices and their consequences in Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird."

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
