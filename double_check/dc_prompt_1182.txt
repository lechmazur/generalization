Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or networks that use modular, interchangeable components to optimize resource distribution or functionality in response to dynamic environmental conditions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Adaptive traffic management systems that use sensors and modular signal controllers to dynamically adjust traffic flow based on real-time conditions.
2. Smart grid systems that employ modular energy storage units and distribution components to optimize electricity distribution in response to fluctuating demand and supply.
3. Modular water purification systems that can be reconfigured with different filtration units to adapt to varying water quality conditions in different environments.
4. Agricultural irrigation systems that use interchangeable sprinkler heads and sensors to adjust water distribution based on soil moisture levels and weather conditions.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A centralized heating system in a building.
6. A traditional power grid with fixed infrastructure.
7. A fixed-route public transportation system.
8. A standard desktop computer with non-upgradable components.
9. A non-adjustable irrigation system for a golf course.
10. A fixed-configuration water treatment plant.
11. A static traffic light system with predetermined timings.
12. A non-modular solar panel installation.
13. A traditional telephone network with fixed lines.
14. A standard HVAC system without smart controls.
15. A fixed-layout factory assembly line.
16. A non-adaptive lighting system in a building.
17. A traditional radio broadcasting system.
18. A fixed-configuration data center.
19. A standard plumbing system in a residential building.
20. A non-modular kitchen appliance set.
21. A fixed-route delivery service.
22. A traditional classroom setup with fixed desks.
23. A standard electrical wiring system in a house.
24. A fixed-configuration amusement park ride.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
