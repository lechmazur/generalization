Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural or historical practices involving the symbolic or practical use of circular motion to represent continuity, resistance, or transformation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the whirling dervishes of Sufi tradition
2. the circular dances of Native American powwows
3. the spinning prayer wheels in Tibetan Buddhism
4. the circular labyrinth walks in medieval Christian practices

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a Ferris wheel
6. a spinning top
7. a merry-go-round
8. a clock face
9. a carousel
10. a bicycle wheel
11. a vinyl record
12. a roulette wheel
13. a hula hoop
14. a spinning compass
15. a windmill
16. a revolving door
17. a spiral staircase
18. a tornado
19. a satellite orbit
20. a spinning coin
21. a ceiling fan
22. a pottery wheel
23. a spinning globe
24. a car tire

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
