Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects from the mid-20th century that were pivotal in their respective fields of science and technology

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the ENIAC computer
2. the first transistor
3. the Apollo Guidance Computer
4. the laser

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the printing press
6. the steam engine
7. the light bulb
8. the telephone
9. the wheel
10. the compass
11. the microscope
12. the telescope
13. the cotton gin
14. the internal combustion engine
15. the airplane
16. the radio
17. the telegraph
18. the typewriter
19. the phonograph
20. the camera
21. the refrigerator
22. the sewing machine
23. the bicycle
24. the zipper

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
