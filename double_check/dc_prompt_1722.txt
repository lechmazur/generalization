Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools and instruments used in traditional construction and music that have been pivotal in cultural or historical movements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The adze, a woodworking tool used in ancient shipbuilding and carpentry
2. The kora, a West African bridge-harp used in traditional music
3. The didgeridoo, an Australian Aboriginal wind instrument
4. The chisel, a tool used in stonemasonry and sculpture throughout history

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern electric guitar
6. A computer-aided design software
7. A 3D printer used in construction
8. A synthesizer used in electronic music
9. A jackhammer used in modern construction
10. A violin used in classical orchestras
11. A drone used for surveying construction sites
12. A piano used in jazz music
13. A laser level used in modern building projects
14. A DJ mixer used in contemporary music performances
15. A power drill used in home renovations
16. A saxophone used in big band music
17. A circular saw used in woodworking
18. A flute used in orchestral music
19. A nail gun used in framing construction
20. A cello used in chamber music
21. A backhoe used in large-scale construction
22. A drum machine used in hip-hop music
23. A concrete mixer used in building projects
24. A trumpet used in jazz and blues music

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
