Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Philosophical theories named after geographical locations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Frankfurt School
2. Kyoto School
3. Vienna Circle
4. Chicago School

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stoicism
6. Utilitarianism
7. Existentialism
8. Pragmatism
9. Marxism
10. Rationalism
11. Empiricism
12. Idealism
13. Materialism
14. Postmodernism
15. Structuralism
16. Deconstruction
17. Phenomenology
18. Analytic Philosophy
19. Continental Philosophy
20. Transcendentalism
21. Humanism
22. Nihilism
23. Determinism
24. Relativism

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
