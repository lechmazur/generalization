Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that undergo a sudden, irreversible transformation when a specific threshold or condition is met, resulting in a permanent shift in state or function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a glass pane shattering when struck with sufficient force
2. a seed germinating after reaching the right temperature and moisture level
3. a chemical compound decomposing upon exposure to a critical temperature
4. a fuse blowing when the electrical current exceeds its capacity

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a car accelerating when the gas pedal is pressed
6. a light bulb dimming when the voltage drops
7. a river flowing downstream
8. a tree growing taller over time
9. a battery losing charge gradually
10. a candle burning down slowly
11. a clock ticking continuously
12. a balloon deflating over time
13. a computer processing data
14. a plant photosynthesizing in sunlight
15. a rock eroding due to wind and rain
16. a person aging gradually
17. a snowman melting in warm weather
18. a book being read page by page
19. a star emitting light over millions of years
20. a bridge swaying in the wind
21. a cloud forming in the sky
22. a train moving along a track
23. a refrigerator cooling food
24. a person learning a new skill over time

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
