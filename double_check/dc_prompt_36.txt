Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative objects that incorporate naturally-occurring, colored mineral or crystal formations into a rigid, human-made framework or structure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A brass-framed agate slice table lamp
2. A sterling silver pendant with raw amethyst crystal
3. A copper-mounted geode bookend pair
4. A bronze-framed quartz crystal wall sconce

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A polished malachite vase
6. A carved jade figurine
7. A natural crystal cluster specimen
8. A glass and metal chandelier
9. A wooden jewelry box with mother of pearl inlay
10. A tumbled stone collection
11. A ceramic bowl with crystalline glaze
12. A faceted gemstone paperweight
13. A marble sculpture
14. A stained glass window
15. A shell-encrusted mirror frame
16. A fossilized wood coffee table
17. An amber pendant
18. A granite countertop
19. A pearl necklace
20. A metal wire tree with glass leaves
21. A carved onyx bowl
22. A synthetic crystal doorknob
23. A glass mosaic vase
24. A coral and driftwood sculpture

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
