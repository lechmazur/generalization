Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that represent the intersection of art and science through the use of natural materials and celestial inspiration.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a sculpture made of driftwood and embedded with bioluminescent algae
2. a sundial crafted from polished stone and engraved with astronomical constellations
3. a kinetic mobile of dried leaves and crystals that refracts sunlight into rainbows
4. a ceramic vase glazed with crushed meteorite dust, depicting the phases of the moon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a digital painting of a galaxy
6. a microscope
7. a telescope
8. a chemistry set
9. a physics textbook
10. a photograph of a solar eclipse
11. a 3D-printed model of a DNA helix
12. a star chart
13. a painting of a forest
14. a sculpture of a human brain
15. a glass prism
16. a compass
17. a weather vane
18. a botanical illustration
19. a model of the solar system
20. a kaleidoscope
21. a crystal geode
22. a wind chime
23. a terrarium
24. a map of the constellations

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
