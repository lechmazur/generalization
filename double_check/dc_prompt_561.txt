Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures designed to prevent the natural movement or expansion of a specific, naturally occurring substance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. levee
2. snow fence
3. seawall
4. avalanche barrier

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. chain link fence
6. prison wall
7. garden trellis
8. cattle gate
9. window screen
10. storm drain
11. bridge
12. guardrail
13. border wall
14. security fence
15. windbreak
16. sound barrier
17. privacy hedge
18. traffic barrier
19. retaining wall
20. barbed wire
21. electric fence
22. turnstile
23. bollard
24. security gate

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
