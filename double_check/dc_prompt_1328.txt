Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that combine functionality with a hidden or unexpected element of danger or mystery, often requiring interaction to reveal their true nature.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a music box that plays a haunting melody when opened, revealing a hidden compartment
2. a seemingly ordinary umbrella that emits a faint glow in the dark, with a concealed blade in the handle
3. a vintage camera that captures images of events that have not yet occurred
4. a decorative hourglass that, when flipped, causes time to slow down for the user

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a flashlight
6. a toaster
7. a bicycle
8. a coffee mug
9. a wristwatch
10. a pair of scissors
11. a bookshelf
12. a lamp
13. a stapler
14. a keychain
15. a notebook
16. a water bottle
17. a pair of headphones
18. a calculator
19. a mirror
20. a pen
21. a backpack
22. a pair of shoes
23. a phone charger
24. a pillow

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
