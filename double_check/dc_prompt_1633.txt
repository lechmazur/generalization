Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Coastal cities that were major centers of Renaissance art and experienced devastating storms between 1500-1600

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Venice
2. Genoa
3. Lisbon
4. Naples

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Florence
6. Rome
7. Paris
8. Amsterdam
9. London
10. Seville
11. Barcelona
12. Bruges
13. Antwerp
14. Vienna
15. Madrid
16. Munich
17. Prague
18. Florence
19. Constantinople
20. Marseille
21. Palermo
22. Dubrovnik
23. Valencia
24. Hamburg

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
