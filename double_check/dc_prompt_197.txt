Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Quiet spaces designed for reflection and contemplation in public settings

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Japanese Zen garden in a city park
2. Library reading room with soundproofing
3. Chapel in an airport terminal
4. Botanical garden meditation area

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bustling city square
6. a concert hall
7. a busy shopping mall
8. a sports stadium
9. a crowded beach
10. a public swimming pool
11. a theme park
12. a subway station
13. a busy restaurant
14. a nightclub
15. a street market
16. a bustling train station
17. a lively festival ground
18. a busy airport lounge
19. a crowded bus terminal
20. a vibrant art gallery opening
21. a busy office lobby
22. a lively community center
23. a packed movie theater
24. a busy highway rest stop

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
