Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or devices that use symmetrical patterns or structures to achieve functionality or aesthetic appeal

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a snowflake
2. a spider web
3. a kaleidoscope
4. a honeycomb

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bridge
6. a skyscraper
7. a car engine
8. a computer motherboard
9. a bicycle
10. a solar panel
11. a wind turbine
12. a clock
13. a musical instrument
14. a satellite
15. a DNA molecule
16. a circuit board
17. a roller coaster
18. a telescope
19. a microscope
20. a camera
21. a smartphone
22. a television
23. a washing machine
24. a refrigerator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
