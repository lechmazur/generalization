Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient artifacts used for storing liquids, made of clay, and featuring intricate designs or inscriptions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a Greek amphora with painted mythological scenes
2. a Roman oil lamp decorated with floral patterns
3. a Minoan pithos adorned with spiral motifs
4. a Mesopotamian jar inscribed with cuneiform text

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bronze statue of a warrior
6. a stone tablet with hieroglyphs
7. a wooden chest for storing grain
8. a glass perfume bottle
9. a metal goblet with gemstone inlays
10. a ceramic figurine of a deity
11. a woven basket for carrying fruits
12. a marble sculpture of a lion
13. a leather water pouch
14. a gold coin with an emperor's portrait
15. a papyrus scroll with ancient text
16. a stone mortar and pestle
17. a wooden shield with painted designs
18. a bone comb with carved patterns
19. a silver chalice used in rituals
20. a clay tablet with mathematical calculations
21. a bronze mirror with engraved symbols
22. a stone altar for offerings
23. a wooden sarcophagus with painted scenes
24. a metal helmet with intricate engravings

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
