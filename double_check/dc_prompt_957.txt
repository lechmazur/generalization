Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Exploratory voyages that resulted in the first circumnavigation of a celestial body by a human-made object

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Luna 3's 1959 mission around the Moon
2. Mariner 10's 1974 Mercury flyby
3. Pioneer 10's 1973 Jupiter encounter
4. Voyager 1's 1980 Saturn flyby

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Apollo 8's lunar orbit mission
6. Magellan's global circumnavigation
7. Cassini's entry into Saturn's atmosphere
8. Viking 1's Mars landing
9. Vostok 1's Earth orbit
10. New Horizons' Pluto flyby
11. Galileo's Jupiter atmospheric probe
12. MESSENGER's Mercury impact
13. Venera 7's Venus landing
14. Sputnik 1's Earth orbit
15. Drake's circumnavigation voyage
16. Zheng He's Indian Ocean expeditions
17. Cook's Pacific exploration
18. Vasco da Gama's India route
19. Hubble Space Telescope's Earth orbit
20. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's mission
21. Curiosity rover's Mars exploration
22. Huygens probe's Titan landing
23. Columbia's first shuttle mission
24. NEAR Shoemaker's asteroid orbit

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
