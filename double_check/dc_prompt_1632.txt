Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific instruments or tools that directly led to a fundamental shift in humanity's understanding of its place in the universe

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Galileo's telescope
2. Hubble Space Telescope
3. Spectroscope
4. Radio telescope

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Microscope
6. Compass
7. Sextant
8. Barometer
9. Thermometer
10. Seismograph
11. DNA sequencer
12. Electron microscope
13. Mass spectrometer
14. pH meter
15. Geiger counter
16. Chronometer
17. Astrolabe
18. Particle accelerator
19. X-ray machine
20. MRI scanner
21. Wind vane
22. Sundial
23. Voltmeter
24. Oscilloscope

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
