Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical events that resulted in the establishment of new sovereign states through treaties signed in the 17th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which recognized the independence of the Dutch Republic and the Swiss Confederation.
2. The Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), which ceded Roussillon and other territories to France, solidifying its southern border.
3. The Treaty of Oliva (1660), which recognized Brandenburg's sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia.
4. The Treaty of Copenhagen (1660), which established the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway over Tr√∏ndelag and Bornholm.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Treaty of Utrecht (1713)
6. The American Revolution (1775-1783)
7. The French Revolution (1789)
8. The Treaty of Versailles (1919)
9. The formation of the United Nations (1945)
10. The decolonization of Africa (mid-20th century)
11. The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)
12. The Louisiana Purchase (1803)
13. The Congress of Vienna (1814-1815)
14. The unification of Germany (1871)
15. The unification of Italy (1861)
16. The Treaty of Paris (1856)
17. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)
18. The Belgian Revolution (1830)
19. The Greek War of Independence (1821-1829)
20. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)
21. The Seven Years' War (1756-1763)
22. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714)
23. The Glorious Revolution (1688)
24. The English Civil War (1642-1651)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
