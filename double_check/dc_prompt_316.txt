Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices that use piezoelectric actuators for nanoscale positioning in an inert atmospheric environment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A device used for precise alignment of optical components in a vacuum chamber
2. An instrument for atomic force microscopy operating in a controlled argon atmosphere
3. A system for nanomanipulation in a helium environment using high-precision actuators
4. A tool for positioning samples in a scanning tunneling microscope under inert gas conditions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A device using thermal actuators for positioning in air
6. An electromagnetic actuator used in a standard atmospheric environment
7. A piezoelectric device for macroscale positioning in a vacuum
8. A system for positioning in a reactive gas environment using piezoelectric actuators
9. A tool for positioning in an industrial setting using hydraulic actuators
10. A device for positioning in a liquid environment using piezoelectric actuators
11. An actuator used for positioning in space without piezoelectric technology
12. A system for positioning in a clean room using electrostatic actuators
13. A device for positioning in a high-pressure environment using piezoelectric actuators
14. A tool for positioning in a magnetic field using piezoelectric actuators
15. A system for positioning in a biological environment using piezoelectric actuators
16. A device for positioning in a corrosive atmosphere using piezoelectric actuators
17. A tool for positioning in a high-temperature environment using piezoelectric actuators
18. A system for positioning in a low-pressure environment using piezoelectric actuators
19. A device for positioning in a humid environment using piezoelectric actuators
20. A tool for positioning in a dusty environment using piezoelectric actuators
21. A system for positioning in a chemically reactive environment using piezoelectric actuators
22. A device for positioning in an outdoor environment using piezoelectric actuators
23. A tool for positioning in a noisy environment using piezoelectric actuators
24. A system for positioning in a variable atmospheric environment using piezoelectric actuators

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
