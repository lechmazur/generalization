Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices from the 19th century used for enhancing visual inspection

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a stereoscope
2. a magnifying glass
3. a camera obscura
4. a magic lantern

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a microscope
6. a telescope
7. a periscope
8. a kaleidoscope
9. a magnifying mirror
10. a pair of binoculars
11. a loupe
12. a projector
13. a slide viewer
14. a film reel
15. a pinhole camera
16. a darkroom
17. a light microscope
18. a prism
19. a spectroscope
20. a photometer
21. a theodolite
22. a sextant
23. a gyroscope
24. a barometer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
