Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed with integrated, self-adjusting mechanisms mimicking biological responses to optimize interaction with natural light.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Smart windows that adjust tint based on sunlight intensity
2. Building facades with louvers that open and close in response to sunlight
3. Solar panels that tilt to follow the sun's path
4. Skylights with sensors that adjust opacity to control light levels

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a regular window with curtains
6. a sun hat
7. a flashlight
8. a sundial
9. a solar-powered calculator
10. a lamp with a dimmer switch
11. a pair of sunglasses
12. a light bulb
13. a solar oven
14. a traditional greenhouse
15. a sun umbrella
16. a solar-powered garden light
17. a regular roof with solar panels
18. a thermostat-controlled heating system
19. a wind turbine
20. a rainwater collection system
21. a motion-sensor light
22. a battery-powered fan
23. a regular mirror
24. a digital clock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
