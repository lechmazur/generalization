Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that involve the interaction of light and motion to create visual patterns or illusions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a spinning disco ball casting moving light spots on a wall
2. a car's headlights reflecting off wet pavement at night
3. a kaleidoscope creating shifting symmetrical patterns
4. a hummingbird's wings appearing blurred due to rapid motion in sunlight

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a rainbow formed by sunlight passing through raindrops
6. a shadow cast by a tree on the ground
7. a flashlight beam shining on a wall
8. a mirror reflecting a stationary object
9. a photograph of a sunset
10. a candle flame flickering in the dark
11. a stained glass window illuminated by sunlight
12. a laser pointer dot on a whiteboard
13. a firework exploding in the sky
14. a lighthouse beam sweeping across the ocean
15. a magnifying glass focusing sunlight onto paper
16. a neon sign glowing in a dark alley
17. a prism splitting light into a spectrum
18. a flashlight beam passing through fog
19. a glowing ember in a campfire
20. a full moon illuminating a landscape
21. a flashlight beam reflecting off a mirror
22. a lightbulb glowing in a lamp
23. a flashlight beam shining through a glass of water
24. a star twinkling in the night sky

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
