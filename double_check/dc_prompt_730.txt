Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Processes that involve iterative refinement to achieve precision in a constrained environment

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Adjusting the focus of a microscope to clearly view a specimen
2. Fine-tuning a musical instrument to achieve perfect pitch
3. Calibrating a precision scale to measure exact weights
4. Refining a search algorithm to improve accuracy within a database

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Learning to ride a bicycle
6. Editing a draft of a novel
7. Improving cooking skills over time
8. Upgrading software to add new features
9. Adjusting a car's alignment for better handling
10. Practicing yoga to increase flexibility
11. Developing a new product through multiple prototypes
12. Training a pet to follow commands
13. Enhancing a photograph using editing software
14. Refining a business strategy to increase profitability
15. Improving public speaking skills through practice
16. Adjusting a recipe to perfect the flavor
17. Learning a new language through repetition
18. Optimizing a website for better user experience
19. Refining a painting technique over time
20. Adjusting a telescope to view distant stars
21. Improving athletic performance through training
22. Developing a new scientific theory through experimentation
23. Refining a dance routine for a performance
24. Adjusting a thermostat to maintain a comfortable temperature

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
