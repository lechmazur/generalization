Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made from materials sourced from specific geological formations and crafted into representational art forms.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A sculpture of a howling wolf carved from Carrara marble
2. A miniature human figure crafted from soapstone quarried in Kisii, Kenya
3. A bas-relief depicting a battle scene, carved into the sandstone cliffs of Petra
4. A mosaic portrait made from pieces of obsidian collected from the Glass Buttes of Oregon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of a mountain landscape
6. A photograph of a rock formation
7. A piece of amethyst jewelry
8. A granite countertop
9. A clay pot
10. A glass bottle
11. A metal sculpture
12. A wooden carving
13. A drawing of a fossil
14. A fossil itself
15. A geode
16. A collection of minerals
17. A diamond ring
18. A piece of petrified wood
19. A stalactite
20. A piece of amber
21. A landscape painting using pigments derived from ochre
22. A sculpture made from recycled glass
23. A building made of limestone
24. A road paved with asphalt

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
