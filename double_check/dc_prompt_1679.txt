Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ceremonial movements or dances that involve deliberate dissonant sounds produced by the performers' bodies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Maori haka warriors performing chest slaps and foot stomps
2. Aboriginal Australian ceremonial dancers creating rhythmic clapping patterns
3. Sufi whirling dervishes incorporating breath sounds and hand claps
4. Native American ghost dancers performing synchronized foot stamping

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ballet dancers performing pirouettes
6. Tap dancers on a wooden stage
7. Drumming circle performers
8. Gospel choir singers
9. Traditional African drum dancers
10. Japanese taiko drummers
11. Flamenco dancers with castanets
12. Irish step dancers
13. Balinese gamelan orchestra performers
14. Brazilian capoeira practitioners
15. Chinese lion dancers
16. Hawaiian hula dancers
17. Indian classical dancers
18. Mexican folkloric dancers
19. Russian folk dancers
20. Scottish highland dancers
21. Korean fan dancers
22. Polynesian fire dancers
23. Venezuelan maracas players
24. Greek traditional circle dancers

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
