Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): technologies or systems that rely on precise alignment or synchronization with celestial bodies or natural phenomena to function effectively

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stonehenge
2. Solar-powered sundial
3. Antikythera mechanism
4. Celestial navigation

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. GPS navigation system
6. Digital clock
7. Smartphone
8. Weather radar
9. Electric car
10. Wi-Fi router
11. Bluetooth speaker
12. Microwave oven
13. Refrigerator
14. Television
15. Satellite dish
16. Electric toothbrush
17. Smart thermostat
18. LED light bulb
19. Virtual reality headset
20. 3D printer
21. Electric guitar
22. Digital camera
23. Smartwatch
24. Video game console

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
