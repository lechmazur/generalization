Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Automated vehicles or robots that are primarily designed to physically restrain or capture targets while operating on land

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A robotic arm used in law enforcement to detain suspects by physically restraining them on the ground.
2. An autonomous vehicle equipped with a net-launching system designed to capture and immobilize fleeing suspects on land.
3. A robot designed for wildlife management that uses a cage mechanism to trap and contain invasive species on land.
4. An automated security robot that uses mechanical arms to physically restrain and hold intruders until human security arrives.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A drone used for surveillance in urban areas.
6. An autonomous vehicle designed for transporting goods in a warehouse.
7. A robot used for cleaning floors in commercial buildings.
8. A self-driving car designed for passenger transportation.
9. A robotic arm used in manufacturing to assemble products.
10. An autonomous underwater vehicle used for oceanographic research.
11. A robot designed to assist the elderly in their homes.
12. A drone equipped with cameras for aerial photography.
13. An automated lawn mower that operates without human intervention.
14. A robot used in agriculture for planting seeds.
15. An autonomous vehicle designed for military reconnaissance.
16. A robotic system used in hospitals for delivering medication.
17. A self-driving truck used for long-haul freight transport.
18. A robot designed for space exploration on other planets.
19. An automated system for sorting and processing mail.
20. A robotic arm used in surgery to assist doctors.
21. An autonomous vehicle used for mapping and surveying land.
22. A robot designed for entertainment, such as dancing or performing.
23. An automated system for monitoring and controlling traffic flow.
24. A robotic device used for inspecting pipelines and infrastructure.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
