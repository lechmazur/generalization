Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made objects designed for personal transportation that utilize a rotary motion for primary propulsion and were commercially available before 1940.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Model T Ford
2. Harley-Davidson Model 7D
3. Indian Scout motorcycle
4. Pierce-Arrow Model 48

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Boeing 247
6. horse-drawn carriage
7. Tesla Model S
8. steam locomotive
9. sailboat
10. Wright Flyer
11. penny-farthing bicycle
12. modern skateboard
13. Roman chariot
14. Segway
15. modern electric scooter
16. hot air balloon
17. modern mountain bike
18. roller skates
19. Honda Civic
20. paddlewheel steamboat
21. modern electric bicycle
22. zeppelin
23. modern motorcycle
24. rickshaw

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
