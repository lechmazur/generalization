Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that incorporate deliberate asymmetry to enhance urban integration with natural landscapes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan
2. The Kunsthaus Graz in Austria
3. The Casa da Musica in Porto, Portugal
4. The CCTV Headquarters in Beijing, China

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Symmetrical skyscraper designs
6. Traditional Japanese garden layouts
7. Modernist architecture with geometric shapes
8. Urban parks designed with symmetrical pathways
9. Historical buildings with symmetrical facades
10. Landscape architecture focusing on natural flow
11. Urban planning that emphasizes grid patterns
12. Architectural designs inspired by natural forms
13. Buildings with symmetrical internal layouts
14. Public spaces designed to mimic natural landscapes
15. Structures built to blend into mountainous terrains
16. Architectural projects that prioritize sustainability
17. Urban developments that incorporate green spaces
18. Buildings designed to reflect cultural heritage
19. Modern architecture with curved, flowing lines
20. Structures that use natural light to enhance interiors
21. Urban designs that promote pedestrian traffic
22. Architectural projects that focus on community integration
23. Buildings designed to withstand natural disasters
24. Structures that incorporate renewable energy sources

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
