Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures that use hierarchical layering to manage or distribute resources, information, or functionality across multiple levels or platforms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A computer operating system with kernel, drivers, and user applications
2. A corporate organizational structure with executives, managers, and employees
3. A multi-tiered web application architecture with presentation, application, and data layers
4. A federal government system with national, state, and local levels

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A single-layer neural network
6. A flat organizational structure
7. A peer-to-peer network
8. A single-page website
9. A monolithic software application
10. A decentralized autonomous organization
11. A linear data structure like an array
12. A non-hierarchical social network
13. A single-level file system
14. A flat tax system
15. A direct democracy
16. A single-tier supply chain
17. A flat database
18. A non-hierarchical team structure
19. A single-layer PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
20. A flat rate pricing model
21. A single-level cache system
22. A non-hierarchical decision-making process
23. A flat earth model
24. A single-layer cake

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
