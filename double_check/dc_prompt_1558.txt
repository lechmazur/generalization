Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Inventions from the early 1900s that were initially demonstrated at state or county fairs before becoming widely adopted

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the Ferris wheel
2. the cotton candy machine
3. the electric washing machine
4. the first commercial airplane

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the telephone
6. the light bulb
7. the printing press
8. the steam engine
9. the radio
10. the television
11. the automobile
12. the typewriter
13. the refrigerator
14. the camera
15. the phonograph
16. the sewing machine
17. the microwave oven
18. the computer
19. the zipper
20. the escalator
21. the vacuum cleaner
22. the helicopter
23. the submarine
24. the electric guitar

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
