Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places known for vibrant, multicolored architecture or landscapes that are significant tourist attractions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Bo-Kaap, Cape Town, South Africa
2. Burano, Venice, Italy
3. Chefchaouen, Morocco
4. Guanajuato City, Mexico

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the Eiffel Tower, Paris, France
6. the Great Wall of China
7. Machu Picchu, Peru
8. the Grand Canyon, USA
9. the Colosseum, Rome, Italy
10. the Taj Mahal, India
11. Niagara Falls, Canada/USA
12. the Sydney Opera House, Australia
13. Stonehenge, England
14. the Statue of Liberty, USA
15. the Pyramids of Giza, Egypt
16. the Amazon Rainforest, South America
17. the Northern Lights, Arctic Circle
18. the Dead Sea, Jordan/Israel
19. the Sahara Desert, Africa
20. the Louvre Museum, Paris, France
21. the Golden Gate Bridge, USA
22. the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania
23. the Great Barrier Reef, Australia
24. Mount Everest, Nepal/China

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
