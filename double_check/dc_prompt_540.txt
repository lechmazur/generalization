Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments made primarily of tonewoods whose common name includes a tree genus.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a guitar made of spruce
2. a violin made of maple
3. a cello made of cedar
4. a mandolin made of mahogany

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a flute made of metal
6. a drum made of synthetic materials
7. a piano with keys made of plastic
8. a harp made of fiberglass
9. a clarinet made of ebony
10. a banjo with a resonator made of steel
11. a ukulele made of laminated wood
12. a saxophone made of brass
13. a tambourine with a wooden frame
14. a bass guitar with a body made of composite materials
15. a marimba with bars made of rosewood
16. a xylophone with synthetic bars
17. a trumpet made of silver
18. a violin bow made of pernambuco wood
19. a guitar with a body made of carbon fiber
20. a cello with a neck made of ebony
21. a mandolin with a body made of laminated wood
22. a drum kit with shells made of acrylic
23. a lute made of yew
24. a viola with a body made of laminated maple

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
