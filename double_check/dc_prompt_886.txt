Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Books that were banned in specific countries due to their portrayal of political ideologies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Animal Farm by George Orwell (banned in the Soviet Union and other communist countries)
2. The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie (banned in several countries with Muslim majorities)
3. Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak (banned in the Soviet Union)
4. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck (banned in parts of the United States during the Great Depression)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain
6. Lady Chatterley's Lover by D.H. Lawrence
7. Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov
8. Ulysses by James Joyce
9. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
10. Brave New World by Aldous Huxley
11. 1984 by George Orwell
12. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
13. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
14. The Color Purple by Alice Walker
15. Beloved by Toni Morrison
16. The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien
17. The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
18. And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie
19. Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn
20. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson
21. The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown
22. Fifty Shades of Grey by E. L. James
23. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins
24. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
