Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional garments that incorporate specific cultural or ceremonial elements and are worn during formal occasions or rituals.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kimono
2. Sari
3. Kilt
4. Hanbok

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. T-shirt
6. Jeans
7. Baseball cap
8. Sneakers
9. Bathrobe
10. Swimsuit
11. Business suit
12. Leather jacket
13. Yoga pants
14. Hoodie
15. Flip-flops
16. Tank top
17. Overalls
18. Tracksuit
19. Cardigan
20. Denim shorts
21. Baseball jersey
22. Raincoat
23. Sun hat
24. Scarf

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
