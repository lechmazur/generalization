Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional tools or crafts that rely on animal power for their operation or creation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Plowing a field with an ox-drawn plow
2. Using a horse-drawn carriage
3. Spinning wool using a spinning wheel powered by a treadle operated by a foot
4. Grinding grain with a donkey-powered millstone

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Using a steam-powered locomotive
6. Weaving cloth on an electric loom
7. Driving a car
8. Using a windmill to pump water
9. Operating a bicycle
10. Using a solar-powered calculator
11. Typing on a computer keyboard
12. Flying a kite
13. Using a hand-cranked radio
14. Rowing a boat
15. Using a gas-powered chainsaw
16. Riding a skateboard
17. Using a wind-up clock
18. Playing a piano
19. Using a hand-operated water pump
20. Riding a bicycle
21. Using a battery-powered flashlight
22. Flying a drone
23. Using a hand-cranked pencil sharpener
24. Riding a scooter

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
