Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations that are known for both their natural beauty and their role in scientific or mathematical research.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Arecibo, Puerto Rico
2. Mauna Kea, Hawaii
3. Atacama Desert, Chile
4. CERN, Switzerland

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Yellowstone National Park
6. Niagara Falls
7. Grand Canyon
8. Silicon Valley
9. Cambridge, Massachusetts
10. The Louvre Museum
11. The Great Barrier Reef
12. Amazon Rainforest
13. Mount Everest
14. Galapagos Islands
15. Serengeti National Park
16. Oxford University
17. The British Museum
18. Kennedy Space Center
19. Walt Disney World
20. Hollywood
21. Las Vegas
22. Times Square
23. The Metropolitan Museum of Art
24. The Smithsonian Institution

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
