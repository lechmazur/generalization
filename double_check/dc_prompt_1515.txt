Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Organisms that use rapid mechanical movement to propel themselves or capture prey

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Venus flytrap
2. Mantis shrimp
3. Chameleon's tongue
4. Woodpecker

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cheetah
6. Falcon
7. Dolphin
8. Spider spinning a web
9. Pitcher plant
10. Sunflower tracking the sun
11. Coral polyp extending tentacles
12. Amoeba moving by pseudopods
13. Paramecium using cilia
14. Flagellum of a bacteria
15. Human walking
16. Snake slithering
17. Worm crawling
18. Fish swimming
19. Bird flying
20. Kangaroo hopping
21. Bladderwort
22. Sundew
23. Cobra spitting venom
24. Archerfish shooting water

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
