Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient rulers known for constructing monumental architectural projects that served both religious and political purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ramses II and the construction of the Abu Simbel temples
2. Ashoka the Great and the creation of the Great Stupa at Sanchi
3. Qin Shi Huang and the building of the Terracotta Army complex
4. Pachacuti and the development of Machu Picchu

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Julius Caesar and the Roman Senate
6. Napoleon Bonaparte and the Napoleonic Code
7. Alexander the Great and his military conquests
8. Cleopatra and her diplomatic alliances
9. Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire's expansion
10. Charlemagne and the Carolingian Renaissance
11. Elizabeth I and the English Renaissance
12. Louis XIV and the Palace of Versailles
13. Henry VIII and the English Reformation
14. Augustus and the Pax Romana
15. Hammurabi and the Code of Hammurabi
16. Justinian I and the Corpus Juris Civilis
17. Shaka Zulu and the Zulu Kingdom's military reforms
18. Akbar the Great and the Mughal administrative system
19. Peter the Great and the modernization of Russia
20. Mehmed the Conqueror and the fall of Constantinople
21. Kublai Khan and the Yuan Dynasty's governance
22. Alfred the Great and the defense of Wessex
23. Montezuma II and the Aztec Empire's diplomacy
24. Harald Hardrada and his Viking expeditions

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
