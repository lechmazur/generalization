Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Women who won major literary or scientific awards before 1980 while raising three or more children

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gwendolyn Brooks, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1950, had four children.
2. Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911, had two daughters.
3. Pearl S. Buck, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1938, adopted seven children.
4. Elizabeth Bishop, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1956, had no children.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A woman who won a major literary award in the 1990s and had two children.
6. A man who won a major scientific award before 1980 and had three children.
7. A woman who won a minor literary award before 1980 and had four children.
8. A woman who won a major scientific award in the 1980s and had three children.
9. A woman who won a major literary award before 1980 but had no children.
10. A woman who won a major scientific award before 1980 and had two children.
11. A man who won a major literary award before 1980 and had three children.
12. A woman who won a major literary award in the 1980s and had three children.
13. A woman who won a major scientific award before 1980 but had no children.
14. A woman who won a major literary award before 1980 and had one child.
15. A man who won a major scientific award in the 1980s and had three children.
16. A woman who won a major literary award before 1980 and had two children.
17. A woman who won a major scientific award in the 1990s and had three children.
18. A man who won a major literary award before 1980 and had two children.
19. A woman who won a major literary award in the 1980s and had two children.
20. A woman who won a major scientific award before 1980 and had one child.
21. A man who won a major scientific award before 1980 and had two children.
22. A woman who won a major literary award in the 1990s and had three children.
23. A woman who won a major scientific award in the 1980s and had two children.
24. A man who won a major literary award in the 1980s and had three children.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
