Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic representations of folklore or mythological figures that have been adapted into modern horror narratives

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Babadook from "The Babadook" (2014)
2. Slender Man from "Slender Man" (2018)
3. La Llorona from "The Curse of La Llorona" (2019)
4. Pennywise the Dancing Clown from "It" (2017)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of a traditional fairy tale scene
6. A sculpture of a historical figure
7. A photograph of a haunted house
8. A drawing of a ghost from a popular ghost story
9. A film poster for a sci-fi horror movie
10. A comic book illustration of a superhero
11. A video game character from a survival horror game
12. A piece of abstract art inspired by fear
13. A costume design for a theater production of a classic play
14. A graphic novel depiction of a dystopian future
15. A mural depicting a scene from a war
16. A digital art piece of a futuristic city
17. A sketch of a character from a romance novel
18. A watercolor painting of a serene landscape
19. A collage made from magazine clippings
20. A tapestry showing a historical event
21. A stained glass window in a church
22. A photograph of a famous landmark
23. A piece of performance art
24. A caricature drawn at a fair

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
