Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that are both used in scientific experimentation and have significant cultural fanbases

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lego bricks
2. Arduino boards
3. Raspberry Pi computers
4. 3D printers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. microscopes
6. test tubes
7. Star Wars lightsabers
8. Harry Potter wands
9. beakers
10. petri dishes
11. Pokemon cards
12. bunsen burners
13. Magic: The Gathering cards
14. lab coats
15. safety goggles
16. pipettes
17. Doctor Who sonic screwdriver
18. centrifuges
19. telescopes
20. Star Trek communicators
21. pH meters
22. spectroscopes
23. Dungeons & Dragons dice
24. thermometers

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
