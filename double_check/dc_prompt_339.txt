Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Sculptures of Roman generals or emperors carved from a single block of dark-colored igneous rock.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Statue of Emperor Augustus carved from a single block of basalt
2. Bust of General Marcus Agrippa sculpted from a single piece of gabbro
3. Figure of Emperor Hadrian hewn from a single block of diorite
4. Portrait of General Lucius Verus crafted from a single piece of andesite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Statue of Emperor Augustus carved from marble
6. Bust of General Marcus Agrippa sculpted from limestone
7. Figure of Emperor Hadrian hewn from granite
8. Portrait of General Lucius Verus crafted from sandstone
9. Statue of Emperor Nero made from bronze
10. Bust of General Julius Caesar sculpted from alabaster
11. Figure of Emperor Trajan carved from a single block of marble
12. Portrait of General Pompey crafted from terracotta
13. Statue of Emperor Caligula made from wood
14. Bust of General Scipio Africanus sculpted from clay
15. Figure of Emperor Vespasian hewn from a single block of limestone
16. Portrait of General Germanicus crafted from a single piece of marble
17. Statue of Emperor Tiberius carved from a single block of granite
18. Bust of General Sulla sculpted from a single piece of sandstone
19. Figure of Emperor Claudius made from a single block of marble
20. Portrait of General Marius crafted from a single piece of limestone
21. Statue of Emperor Domitian made from a single block of marble
22. Bust of General Crassus sculpted from a single piece of alabaster
23. Figure of Emperor Antoninus Pius hewn from a single block of marble
24. Portrait of General Cato crafted from a single piece of clay

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
