Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Beaches named after precious materials or gems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gold Beach, Oregon
2. Silver Beach, Michigan
3. Pearl Beach, Victoria, Australia
4. Coral Beach, Cyprus

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Copper Beach, New York
6. Iron Beach, Brazil
7. Stone Beach, England
8. Sandstone Beach, California
9. Shell Beach, California
10. Driftwood Beach, Georgia
11. Pebble Beach, California
12. Glass Beach, California
13. Black Sand Beach, Iceland
14. White Sand Beach, Thailand
15. Red Sand Beach, Hawaii
16. Pink Sand Beach, Bahamas
17. Green Sand Beach, Hawaii
18. Volcanic Beach, Italy
19. Coral Sand Beach, Maldives
20. Seashell Beach, Florida
21. Rocky Beach, Maine
22. Cliff Beach, Australia
23. Sandy Beach, Hawaii
24. Shingle Beach, England

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
