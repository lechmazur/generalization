Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that symbolize transformation or rebirth and are used in rituals or systems of belief to represent cyclical change or renewal.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a phoenix
2. a butterfly
3. the lotus flower
4. the ouroboros

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a clock
6. a rainbow
7. a mirror
8. a compass
9. a diamond
10. a mountain
11. a river
12. a candle
13. a tree
14. a star
15. a book
16. a bridge
17. a key
18. a feather
19. a shell
20. a sword
21. a crown
22. a pearl
23. a wave
24. a lantern

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
