Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures built above 4000 meters elevation that incorporate repurposed materials from aircraft or spacecraft wrecks.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Himalayan weather station at 4200m, insulated with panels salvaged from a crashed C-130 transport plane.
2. An Andean emergency shelter at 4500m, constructed with fuselage sections from a downed helicopter.
3. A research outpost on a Tibetan plateau at 4800m, using a repurposed satellite dish as a radio telescope reflector.
4. A high-altitude mining camp in the Bolivian Andes at 4100m, powered by solar panels retrieved from a defunct space probe's landing stage.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A house built from shipping containers.
6. An art installation made from recycled car parts.
7. A bridge constructed with repurposed railway tracks.
8. A wind turbine built on a mountaintop.
9. A solar farm in the desert.
10. An igloo built from snow blocks.
11. A log cabin in the woods.
12. A treehouse built in a tall tree.
13. A yurt on the Mongolian steppe.
14. A tent pitched in a campground.
15. A mountaintop monastery.
16. A research station in Antarctica.
17. An observatory on a volcanic peak.
18. A ski lodge in the Alps.
19. A cable car station on a mountainside.
20. A dam built in a mountain valley.
21. A tunnel bored through a mountain.
22. A mine shaft dug into a mountain.
23. A satellite orbiting Earth.
24. A space station in low Earth orbit.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
