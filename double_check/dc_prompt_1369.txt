Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Processes or systems that start with a single entity and progressively split into smaller, less significant components until reaching a predetermined minimum threshold

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a river branching into tributaries until it becomes a stream
2. a family tree starting from a single ancestor and splitting into descendants
3. a company dividing into departments, teams, and individual roles
4. a computer program breaking down tasks into subroutines and functions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a tree growing from a seed
6. a snowflake forming from water vapor
7. a chain of dominoes falling
8. a spider web being spun
9. a puzzle being assembled
10. a book being written chapter by chapter
11. a recipe being followed step by step
12. a city expanding outward
13. a train moving along tracks
14. a clock ticking second by second
15. a ladder being climbed rung by rung
16. a staircase being ascended step by step
17. a chain reaction in nuclear fission
18. a ripple spreading across water
19. a fire spreading through a forest
20. a wave crashing on the shore
21. a balloon inflating
22. a flower blooming
23. a star forming from a nebula
24. a car engine running

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
