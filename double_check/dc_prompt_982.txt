Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena that involve the transformation of energy into detectable waves or particles in space

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gamma-ray bursts from collapsing stars
2. Solar flares emitting X-rays and radio waves
3. Cosmic microwave background radiation
4. Supernovae releasing neutrinos

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lightning strikes
6. Earthquakes
7. Tornadoes
8. Volcanic eruptions
9. Ocean waves
10. Sound waves from thunder
11. Heat waves
12. Photosynthesis
13. Chemical reactions
14. Radioactive decay
15. Magnetic fields
16. Gravitational waves
17. Seismic waves
18. Wind energy
19. Thermal radiation
20. Electrical currents
21. Light refraction
22. Acoustic waves
23. Particle accelerators
24. Nuclear fusion

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
