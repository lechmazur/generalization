Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices designed for controlled application of fire or heat in non-military contexts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Bunsen burner
2. soldering iron
3. butane torch lighter
4. heat gun

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. flamethrower
6. incendiary grenade
7. campfire
8. forest fire
9. volcanic eruption
10. lightning strike
11. matchbox
12. cigarette lighter
13. furnace
14. fireplace
15. gas stove
16. bonfire
17. wildfire
18. thermal detonator
19. plasma cutter
20. welding torch
21. oil lamp
22. tiki torch
23. burning barrel
24. molotov cocktail

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
