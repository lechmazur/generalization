Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Works of fiction featuring protagonists who undergo significant personal transformation after experiencing isolation or solitude

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Robinson Crusoe
2. The Metamorphosis
3. Life of Pi
4. Into the Wild

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Gatsby
6. Pride and Prejudice
7. 1984
8. To Kill a Mockingbird
9. The Catcher in the Rye
10. Moby-Dick
11. The Lord of the Rings
12. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
13. The Hunger Games
14. The Alchemist
15. The Road
16. The Handmaid's Tale
17. Brave New World
18. The Odyssey
19. Frankenstein
20. The Scarlet Letter
21. Wuthering Heights
22. The Picture of Dorian Gray
23. Jane Eyre
24. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
