Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural artifacts or practices that utilize natural materials or elements to create functional or symbolic objects tied to survival, tradition, or identity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A woven reed basket used for gathering and storing food.
2. An Inuit parka made from sealskin and caribou hide.
3. A totem pole carved from a cedar tree, representing clan lineage and stories.
4. A didgeridoo, a wind instrument made from a eucalyptus tree hollowed out by termites, used in Aboriginal Australian ceremonies.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of a landscape.
6. A photograph of a flower.
7. A song about nature.
8. A poem about the seasons.
9. A synthetic tent.
10. A metal water bottle.
11. A plastic chair.
12. A glass window.
13. A concrete building.
14. A steel bridge.
15. A digital photograph of a natural landscape.
16. A documentary film about wildlife.
17. A book about survival skills.
18. A blog post about environmentalism.
19. A social media campaign about climate change.
20. A solar panel.
21. A wind turbine.
22. A hydroelectric dam.
23. A genetically modified crop.
24. A laboratory-created biofuel.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
