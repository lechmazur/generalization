Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional practices that incorporate rhythmic elements to facilitate altered states of consciousness

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sama chanting in Sufism
2. Rhythmic drumming in a shamanic ritual
3. Circular dances of the Whirling Dervishes
4. Tantric breathing exercises with specific rhythmic patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Listening to classical music
6. Playing a musical instrument
7. Singing in a choir
8. Dancing at a club
9. Meditation
10. Yoga
11. Hypnosis
12. Using binaural beats
13. Taking psychedelic drugs
14. Sleep deprivation
15. Sensory overload
16. Fasting
17. Praying the rosary
18. Chanting Om
19. Attending a religious service
20. Watching a rhythmic sporting event
21. Rock climbing
22. Long-distance running
23. Playing a rhythm game
24. Listening to white noise

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
