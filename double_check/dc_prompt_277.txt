Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Publicly accessible structures built before 1900 that contain intricate mechanical timekeeping devices

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Prague Astronomical Clock in the Old Town Hall of Prague, Czech Republic
2. The Wells Cathedral Clock in Somerset, England
3. The Strasbourg Cathedral Astronomical Clock in Strasbourg, France
4. The Zytglogge Clock Tower in Bern, Switzerland

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern digital clock in a public square
6. A sundial in a public park
7. A water clock in a museum
8. A grandfather clock in a private residence
9. A wristwatch from the early 20th century
10. A public library built in 1905
11. A modern planetarium with a digital time display
12. An ancient Roman aqueduct
13. A medieval castle with no timekeeping devices
14. A public monument built in 1920
15. A pocket watch from the 1800s
16. A modern skyscraper with a large clock
17. A church bell tower built in 1910
18. An hourglass in a historical exhibit
19. A public fountain built in 1850 with no timekeeping device
20. A train station clock from the 1930s
21. A mechanical clock in a private collection
22. A public building constructed in 1890 with a simple clock
23. A modern art installation featuring time
24. A historical ship with a navigational clock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
