Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Large-scale structures or systems that manipulate or harness natural forces to create visually striking or surreal environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A massive dam that creates a vast reservoir, altering the landscape and climate of the region.
2. A sprawling wind farm with hundreds of turbines, transforming the horizon into a field of rotating blades.
3. An enormous greenhouse complex that simulates different climates and ecosystems under one roof.
4. A large-scale solar power plant with thousands of mirrors reflecting sunlight to a central tower, creating a dazzling light display.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A small garden fountain
6. A traditional windmill used for grinding grain
7. A single solar panel on a rooftop
8. A lighthouse on a rocky coast
9. A city park with a few trees and benches
10. A hydroelectric generator in a small stream
11. A simple weather vane on a barn
12. A local farmer's market
13. A small-scale model of a volcano
14. A traditional coal-fired power plant
15. A single wind turbine in a rural area
16. A community swimming pool
17. A small waterfall in a nature reserve
18. A traditional fireplace in a home
19. A local art installation in a city square
20. A single street lamp powered by solar energy
21. A small pond in a backyard
22. A traditional water wheel on a river
23. A local recycling center
24. A small wind chime hanging on a porch

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
