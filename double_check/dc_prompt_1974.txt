Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Volcanic formations characterized by their slow extrusion of viscous lava, resulting in a steep-sided, rounded mound.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Pelée in Martinique
2. Lassen Peak in California
3. Mount Taranaki in New Zealand
4. Merapi in Indonesia

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mount St. Helens
6. Mauna Loa
7. Kilauea
8. Mount Fuji
9. Krakatoa
10. Vesuvius
11. Olympus Mons
12. Paricutin
13. Mount Etna
14. Stromboli
15. Yellowstone Caldera
16. Santorini
17. Mount Tambora
18. Pinatubo
19. Eyjafjallajökull
20. Taupo Volcano
21. Arenal Volcano
22. Popocatépetl
23. Chimborazo
24. Cotopaxi

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
