Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools or techniques specifically designed to enable precise manipulation or control of a single, flexible, elongated object.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. chopsticks
2. fishing rod
3. lasso
4. catheter guide wire manipulator

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. pliers
6. wrench
7. screwdriver
8. hammer
9. scissors
10. tongs
11. crane
12. forklift
13. tweezers
14. robotic arm
15. pulley system
16. conveyor belt
17. clamp
18. vise grip
19. soldering iron
20. paintbrush
21. spatula
22. scalpel
23. crowbar
24. chisel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
