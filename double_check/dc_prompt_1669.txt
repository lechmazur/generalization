Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Annual festivals held on Mediterranean islands that feature masked performers in traditional costumes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Carnival of Venice
2. Apokries in Greece
3. Festa di Sant'Agata in Sicily
4. Mamuthones e Issohadores in Sardinia

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Oktoberfest in Munich
6. Day of the Dead in Mexico
7. La Tomatina in Spain
8. Holi Festival in India
9. Mardi Gras in New Orleans
10. Rio Carnival in Brazil
11. Lantern Festival in Taiwan
12. Cherry Blossom Festival in Japan
13. Glastonbury Festival in England
14. Coachella in California
15. Burning Man in Nevada
16. Songkran in Thailand
17. Inti Raymi in Peru
18. Notting Hill Carnival in London
19. Venice Film Festival in Italy
20. Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland
21. Diwali in India
22. Hanami in Japan
23. St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dublin
24. Chinese New Year in Beijing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
