Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures designed and built primarily to manage the flow of water, featuring at least three distinct levels or tiers of channels/conduits.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a multi-tiered aqueduct system with cascading channels
2. a stepped irrigation network with layered water distribution
3. a tiered rainwater harvesting structure with multiple conduits
4. a three-level flood control dam with integrated spillways

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a single-level irrigation canal
6. a water tower
7. a hydroelectric dam
8. a stormwater drain
9. a water filtration plant
10. a reservoir
11. a water fountain
12. a fish ladder
13. a waterwheel
14. a desalination plant
15. a water pipeline
16. a tidal barrier
17. a rainwater barrel
18. a water treatment facility
19. a levee
20. a spillway
21. a culvert
22. a water pump station
23. a weir
24. a water cistern

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
