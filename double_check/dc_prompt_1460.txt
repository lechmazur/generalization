Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional characters who are cruel stepmothers to protagonists and have names containing nobility titles

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lady Tremaine from Cinderella
2. The Baroness from The Princess Diaries
3. Duchess of Buchenwald from The Princess Bride
4. Countess Dorothea from The Little Princess

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians
6. Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty
7. The Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland
8. Ursula from The Little Mermaid
9. Scar from The Lion King
10. The Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz
11. Stepmother from Snow White
12. Mrs. Coulter from His Dark Materials
13. Miss Trunchbull from Matilda
14. Grand High Witch from The Witches
15. Queen Bavmorda from Willow
16. Queen Narissa from Enchanted
17. Evil Queen from The Huntsman: Winter's War
18. Morgause from Merlin
19. Morgan le Fay from Arthurian legend
20. Queen Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones
21. Queen Ravenna from Snow White and the Huntsman
22. Queen Grimhilde from Snow White
23. Queen Jadis from The Chronicles of Narnia
24. Queen Levana from The Lunar Chronicles

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
