Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Robotic devices designed for companionship that can be programmed by their users

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A customizable robotic cat that can be programmed to purr, play fetch, and learn new tricks.
2. A build-it-yourself robotic dog with open-source software, allowing users to create unique personalities and behaviors.
3. A robotic bird companion that can be taught to sing specific songs and respond to voice commands through user-created programs.
4. A modular robotic companion that can be configured into different shapes and programmed with various interactive functionalities.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smart thermostat that learns user preferences.
6. A self-driving car.
7. A robotic vacuum cleaner.
8. A voice-activated virtual assistant.
9. A robotic arm used in manufacturing.
10. A surgical robot.
11. A drone for aerial photography.
12. A robotic toy that follows pre-programmed commands.
13. A social media platform.
14. A video game console.
15. A fitness tracker.
16. A smart refrigerator.
17. A 3D printer.
18. A language learning app.
19. A robotic lawnmower.
20. A security camera with facial recognition.
21. A smart watch.
22. A delivery robot.
23. A robotic exoskeleton.
24. A remote-controlled car.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
