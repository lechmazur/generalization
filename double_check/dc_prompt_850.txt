Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional art forms that incorporate elaborate costumes and makeup as a central element of performance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kabuki
2. Beijing Opera
3. Kathakali
4. Noh theater

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ballet
6. Modern dance
7. Circus acrobatics
8. Street mime
9. Professional wrestling
10. Ice skating
11. Ventriloquism
12. Stand-up comedy
13. Musical theater
14. Puppet shows
15. Jazz dance
16. Flamenco
17. Tap dancing
18. Capoeira
19. Shadow puppetry
20. Juggling
21. Magic shows
22. Contemporary theater
23. Opera
24. Pantomime

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
