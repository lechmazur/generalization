Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products that incorporate a noble metal element purely for aesthetic purposes and not for functionality.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gold-plated picture frame
2. Silver-colored decorative vase
3. Platinum-finished jewelry box
4. Palladium-accented watch band

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stainless steel kitchen appliance
6. Copper-bottomed cookware
7. Aluminum foil
8. Brass door handle
9. Chrome-plated car bumper
10. Titanium bicycle frame
11. Nickel-plated guitar strings
12. Lead crystal glassware
13. Zinc oxide sunscreen
14. Iron skillet
15. Magnesium alloy laptop casing
16. Mercury thermometer
17. Tungsten wedding band
18. Antimony flame retardant
19. Bismuth-based stomach remedy
20. Cadmium yellow paint
21. Indium tin oxide touch screen
22. Thallium-doped fiber optic cable
23. Germanium transistor
24. Arsenic-treated wood

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
