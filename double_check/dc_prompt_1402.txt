Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools or devices used to process grain or seeds that were independently invented by at least three ancient civilizations before 1000 BCE

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. quern stone
2. mortar and pestle
3. threshing floor
4. sickle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. plow
6. irrigation canal
7. pottery wheel
8. loom
9. bronze sword
10. chariot
11. kiln
12. writing tablet
13. calendar
14. compass
15. astrolabe
16. water clock
17. coin
18. papyrus scroll
19. harpoon
20. bow and arrow
21. flint knife
22. fishing net
23. basket
24. brick mold

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
