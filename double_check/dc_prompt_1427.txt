Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural elements that were first developed for religious buildings but later became common in sports stadiums

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Vaulted ceilings
2. Colonnades
3. Gargoyles
4. Stained glass windows

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Scoreboards
6. Floodlights
7. Concession stands
8. Retractable roofs
9. Jumbotrons
10. Bleachers
11. Luxury boxes
12. Astroturf
13. Turnstiles
14. Goal posts
15. Locker rooms
16. Scoreboards
17. Press boxes
18. Running tracks
19. Parking lots
20. Ticket booths
21. Sound systems
22. Video replay screens
23. Team dugouts
24. Player benches

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
