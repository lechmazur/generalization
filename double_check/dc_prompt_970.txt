Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations or objects named after famous mathematicians that are not directly related to mathematics or computing.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Euler's Bridge in Switzerland
2. Gauss Crater on the Moon
3. Riemann Glacier in Antarctica
4. Pascal Island in Canada

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Newton's Laws of Motion
6. Fibonacci Sequence
7. Turing Machine
8. Pythagorean Theorem
9. Euclidean Geometry
10. Archimedes' Principle
11. Leibniz Notation
12. Boolean Algebra
13. Hilbert Space
14. Bernoulli's Equation
15. Fourier Transform
16. Ramanujan's Conjecture
17. Desargues' Theorem
18. Laplace's Equation
19. Galois Theory
20. Banach Space
21. GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems
22. Poisson Distribution
23. Dirac Delta Function
24. Kolmogorov Complexity

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
