Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate preserved botanical specimens visible through a transparent surface.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. resin jewelry with embedded flowers
2. glass paperweight with a dried leaf inside
3. laminated bookmark with pressed flowers
4. acrylic phone case with embedded ferns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wooden table with floral carvings
6. a ceramic vase with painted flowers
7. a cotton shirt with a floral print
8. a metal keychain with a flower charm
9. a plastic water bottle with a floral design
10. a wallpaper with a botanical pattern
11. a leather wallet with embossed leaves
12. a silk scarf with a botanical motif
13. a canvas tote bag with a flower illustration
14. a porcelain plate with a floral border
15. a cotton pillowcase with a leaf pattern
16. a wool blanket with a botanical theme
17. a metal sculpture of a tree
18. a glass window with etched floral designs
19. a stone statue of a flower
20. a digital wallpaper with a botanical theme
21. a wooden chair with leaf-shaped cutouts
22. a plastic toy with a flower shape
23. a ceramic mug with a leaf print
24. a cotton curtain with a floral pattern

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
