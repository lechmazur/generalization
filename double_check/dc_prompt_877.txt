Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize controlled randomness to achieve functional efficiency or aesthetic appeal

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A casino slot machine's random number generator
2. A music streaming service's shuffle algorithm
3. A genetic algorithm for optimizing factory production schedules
4. A procedural terrain generator in video games

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A dice game
6. A random number table
7. A lottery drawing machine
8. A card shuffler
9. A roulette wheel
10. A random password generator
11. A coin flip
12. A bingo ball machine
13. A raffle ticket drawer
14. A random name picker
15. A chaos pendulum
16. A weather pattern simulator
17. A quantum random number generator
18. A random walk algorithm
19. A Monte Carlo simulation
20. A random sampling method
21. A stochastic process model
22. A random forest algorithm
23. A probabilistic neural network
24. A random mutation genetic operator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
