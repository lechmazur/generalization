Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): beachside installations that incorporate renewable energy sources

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A solar-powered beach shower station with integrated LED lighting
2. A wind turbine-equipped lifeguard tower with emergency communication systems
3. A wave-powered desalination unit attached to a beachfront restroom facility
4. A solar-thermal changing room complex with heated freshwater rinse stations

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional wooden lifeguard tower
6. A beach volleyball court with floodlights
7. A coastal wind farm
8. A seaside playground
9. A beach umbrella rental kiosk
10. A surfboard storage rack
11. A beachfront restaurant
12. A solar farm in the desert
13. A tidal power station
14. A beach wheelchair access ramp
15. A coastal observation deck
16. A public drinking fountain
17. A beach cleanup station
18. An oceanfront hotel
19. A wave breaker wall
20. A beach parking meter
21. A coastal weather station
22. A beachside fitness park
23. A marine research facility
24. A seaside boardwalk

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
