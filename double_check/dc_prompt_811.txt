Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Literary works featuring a journey with an unexpected mode of transportation that becomes central to the plot.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A group of children discover a sentient, flying carousel horse that takes them on a journey through the clouds to a hidden land.
2. A scientist invents a teleportation device disguised as a refrigerator, leading to accidental journeys through time and alternate dimensions.
3. A runaway teenager escapes on a self-driving, solar-powered skateboard that develops a quirky personality and guides her on a cross-country adventure.
4. A man finds an antique grandfather clock that transports him to different historical periods whenever it chimes, forcing him to navigate unfamiliar eras and find a way back.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A road trip in a vintage car.
6. A cross-country train journey.
7. A sea voyage on a cruise ship.
8. A backpacking trip through the wilderness.
9. A hot air balloon ride over a scenic landscape.
10. A bicycle tour across Europe.
11. A space mission to Mars.
12. A submarine expedition to the deepest ocean trench.
13. A pilgrimage to a sacred site.
14. A quest for a lost artifact.
15. A character's inner emotional journey.
16. A story about a character's personal growth.
17. A tale of self-discovery.
18. A journey through grief and loss.
19. A story about overcoming adversity.
20. A character's journey from rags to riches.
21. A story about finding love.
22. A journey of revenge.
23. A character's descent into madness.
24. A story about redemption.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
