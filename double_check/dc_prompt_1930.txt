Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made bodies of water used for therapeutic purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. spa pool
2. hydrotherapy pool
3. thalassotherapy pool
4. balneotherapy bath

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. swimming pool
6. lake
7. reservoir
8. fountain
9. hot tub
10. jacuzzi
11. water park
12. fish pond
13. irrigation canal
14. decorative pond
15. natural hot spring
16. river
17. ocean
18. bathtub
19. sauna
20. geyser
21. waterfall
22. moat
23. lagoon
24. wetland

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
