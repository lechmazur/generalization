Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): technologies that integrate biological principles with digital systems to enhance functionality or efficiency

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Neural networks used in artificial intelligence to mimic brain function
2. Biometric sensors that use human physiological data for digital authentication
3. Genetic algorithms applied in software to optimize solutions by simulating natural selection
4. Bio-inspired robotics that use principles of animal locomotion for enhanced mobility

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smart home devices that automate household functions
6. Virtual reality systems that create immersive digital environments
7. Cloud computing services that enhance data storage and processing
8. Blockchain technology used for secure and transparent transactions
9. Augmented reality applications that overlay digital information on the real world
10. Internet of Things (IoT) devices that connect everyday objects to the internet
11. Quantum computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform operations on data
12. 3D printing technology that allows for the creation of complex physical objects
13. Artificial intelligence systems that use machine learning to improve performance
14. Robotic process automation that streamlines business processes
15. Wearable technology that tracks fitness and health metrics
16. Big data analytics that process large volumes of data to uncover insights
17. Cybersecurity systems that protect digital networks and devices from threats
18. Mobile applications that provide services on smartphones and tablets
19. Social media platforms that facilitate communication and content sharing
20. Edge computing that processes data near the source to reduce latency
21. Digital twins that create virtual replicas of physical objects or systems
22. Autonomous vehicles that use sensors and algorithms to navigate without human input
23. 5G networks that provide faster and more reliable internet connectivity
24. Voice recognition systems that allow for hands-free operation of devices

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
