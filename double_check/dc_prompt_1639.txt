Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Situations where a single entity must maintain sustained attention while processing multiple simultaneous inputs that arrive at unpredictable intervals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A radar operator monitoring airspace for incoming aircraft
2. A stock trader watching multiple market feeds for sudden changes
3. A security guard observing multiple surveillance camera feeds
4. A musician playing in a band while listening to other instruments

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A teacher grading papers
6. A chef following a recipe
7. A librarian organizing books
8. A writer drafting a novel
9. A scientist conducting a single experiment
10. A driver following a GPS
11. A student taking a test
12. A gardener planting flowers
13. A painter working on a canvas
14. A pilot flying a plane on autopilot
15. A cashier scanning items at checkout
16. A photographer taking a portrait
17. A programmer writing code
18. A baker decorating a cake
19. A fisherman waiting for a catch
20. A tailor sewing a garment
21. A cyclist on a long-distance ride
22. A swimmer doing laps in a pool
23. A sculptor chiseling a statue
24. A commuter reading a book on a train

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
