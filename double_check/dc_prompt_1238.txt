Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): natural or man-made structures that are shaped or influenced by the movement of wind or water over time

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Grand Canyon
2. Sand dunes in the Sahara Desert
3. The arches of Arches National Park
4. The limestone formations in the Waitomo Caves

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A skyscraper
6. A dam
7. A bridge
8. A wind turbine
9. A coral reef
10. A glacier
11. A volcano
12. A forest
13. A mountain range
14. A river delta
15. A waterfall
16. A lake
17. A canyon
18. A beach
19. A cliff
20. A cave
21. A peninsula
22. An island
23. A fjord
24. A geyser

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
