Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures built or significantly modified after major global conflicts to symbolize peace or renewal.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park
2. The Berlin Wall Memorial
3. The Coventry Cathedral
4. The Nagasaki Peace Park

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Statue of Liberty
6. The Eiffel Tower
7. The Great Wall of China
8. The Taj Mahal
9. The Colosseum
10. The Pyramids of Giza
11. The Golden Gate Bridge
12. The Empire State Building
13. The Christ the Redeemer statue
14. The Sydney Opera House
15. The Brandenburg Gate
16. The Arc de Triomphe
17. The Lincoln Memorial
18. The Washington Monument
19. The World Trade Center (original)
20. The Pentagon
21. The United Nations Headquarters
22. The International Space Station
23. The Channel Tunnel
24. The Burj Khalifa

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
