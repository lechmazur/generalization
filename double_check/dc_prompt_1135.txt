Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that produce a sudden, intense, and localized disruption of silence or stillness in an otherwise quiet environment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A mousetrap snapping shut
2. A balloon unexpectedly popping
3. A firecracker exploding
4. A tree branch snapping in a silent forest

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A gentle breeze rustling leaves
6. A car driving down a busy street
7. A clock ticking
8. A refrigerator humming
9. A bird chirping
10. A river flowing
11. A person snoring
12. A dog barking in the distance
13. A siren wailing
14. Music playing softly
15. Rain steadily falling
16. Waves crashing on the shore
17. A door creaking open slowly
18. A cat meowing
19. A train passing by
20. A lightbulb buzzing
21. A cricket chirping
22. Wind chimes tinkling
23. A flag flapping in the wind
24. A child whispering

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
