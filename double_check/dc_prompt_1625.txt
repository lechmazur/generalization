Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Political figures who were widely criticized for their handling of labor strikes during their time in office

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Margaret Thatcher during the UK miners' strike of 1984-1985
2. Ronald Reagan during the 1981 air traffic controllers' strike
3. Grover Cleveland during the 1894 Pullman Strike
4. Nicol√°s Maduro during the 2016 Venezuelan general strike

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a labor union leader advocating for workers' rights
6. a politician praised for mediating a labor dispute
7. a historical figure known for abolishing child labor
8. a government official who increased minimum wage
9. a leader who implemented universal healthcare
10. a president who signed a major trade agreement
11. a mayor who improved public transportation
12. a governor who expanded education funding
13. a senator who championed environmental protection
14. a prime minister who reduced unemployment rates
15. a political figure who supported universal basic income
16. a leader who promoted gender equality in the workplace
17. a president who focused on infrastructure development
18. a politician who advocated for paid family leave
19. a leader who introduced pension reforms
20. a governor who prioritized renewable energy projects
21. a mayor who implemented affordable housing policies
22. a president who negotiated a peace treaty
23. a prime minister who reduced national debt
24. a political figure who focused on technological innovation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
