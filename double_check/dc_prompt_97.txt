Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Enclosed ecosystems designed for extreme environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lunar greenhouse module for growing food crops
2. Self-sustaining underwater habitat for deep-sea research
3. Closed-loop bioregenerative life support system for a Mars mission
4. Mobile, autonomous desert ecosystem for scientific study

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Terrarium
6. Aquarium
7. Vertical farm
8. Hydroponics system
9. Greenhouse
10. Biodome
11. Space suit
12. Submarine
13. Mars rover
14. Weather balloon
15. Ant farm
16. Compost bin
17. Eco-village
18. Sustainable building
19. Off-grid cabin
20. Oxygen tank
21. Water purification system
22. Solar panel
23. Wind turbine
24. Geodesic dome

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
