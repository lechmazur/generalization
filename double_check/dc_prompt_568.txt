Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical artifacts found in museums that depict or are directly related to the earliest known examples of wheeled transportation in human history.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a clay tablet depicting a chariot from ancient Mesopotamia
2. a wooden wheel fragment from the Ljubljana Marshes in Slovenia
3. a bronze model of a wheeled cart from the Indus Valley Civilization
4. a stone carving of a wheeled vehicle from the ancient city of Ur

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a Roman gladiator helmet
6. a Viking longship
7. a medieval suit of armor
8. a Greek amphora
9. a Egyptian sarcophagus
10. a Chinese terracotta warrior
11. a Mayan calendar stone
12. a Native American totem pole
13. a Renaissance painting
14. a Victorian-era steam engine
15. a medieval tapestry
16. a Roman mosaic
17. a Viking sword
18. a Greek marble statue
19. a Egyptian papyrus scroll
20. a Chinese jade carving
21. a Mayan jade mask
22. a Native American arrowhead
23. a Baroque-era harpsichord
24. a medieval illuminated manuscript

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
