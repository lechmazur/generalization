Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Activities or practices that involve a cyclical or repetitive motion to achieve a goal or outcome, where the motion is both intentional and central to the activity's purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Knitting a sweater
2. Sawing a piece of wood
3. Pumping a bicycle tire
4. Stirring batter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Brushing teeth
6. Walking
7. Running
8. Driving a car
9. Typing on a keyboard
10. Playing the piano
11. Chewing food
12. Blinking
13. Breathing
14. Heart beating
15. Planetary orbits
16. Seasons changing
17. Tides ebbing and flowing
18. Day and night cycle
19. Pendulum swinging
20. Washing machine cycle
21. Fan blades rotating
22. Record spinning
23. Wheels turning
24. Clock ticking

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
