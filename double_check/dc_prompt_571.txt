Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that incorporate a naturally occurring subterranean cavity as a primary structural or functional element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A restaurant built into a lava tube
2. A wine cellar utilizing a natural cave
3. A home built into a cliff dwelling
4. A mine using pre-existing caverns for ore extraction

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A basement
6. A root cellar
7. An underground bunker
8. A subway station
9. A tunnel
10. A swimming pool built into a hillside
11. A building with a geothermal heat pump
12. A buried time capsule
13. A dam
14. A bridge built over a canyon
15. A building with underground parking
16. A well
17. A septic tank
18. An underground pipeline
19. A geothermal power plant
20. A cave painting
21. A fossil found in a rock layer
22. A gemstone mine
23. An underground lake
24. A burrow

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
