Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): modular structures designed for specific environments with integrated specialized tools

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Antarctic research station mobile laboratory pod
2. Deep-sea exploration submersible equipment bay
3. Space station airlock repair module
4. Desert field hospital surgical unit

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Shipping container
6. Garden shed
7. Mobile home
8. Construction site office
9. Storage locker
10. Greenhouse
11. Portable classroom
12. Food truck
13. Emergency shelter
14. Camping trailer
15. Tool shed
16. Aircraft hangar
17. Garage workshop
18. Recording studio booth
19. Security guard booth
20. Phone booth
21. Lifeguard tower
22. Ticket booth
23. ATM kiosk
24. Portable toilet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
