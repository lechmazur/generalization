Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that represent a state of absence or reduction in their typical function or form

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a deflated balloon
2. a broken clock
3. a silenced bell
4. an empty bookshelf

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a full glass of water
6. a functioning car
7. a lit candle
8. a blooming flower
9. a charged battery
10. a loudspeaker
11. a complete puzzle
12. a running faucet
13. a powered lightbulb
14. a healthy tree
15. a spinning top
16. a full gas tank
17. a ringing phone
18. a painted canvas
19. a working computer
20. a flowing river
21. a glowing neon sign
22. a ticking metronome
23. a stocked refrigerator
24. a spinning fan

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
