Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Volcanic eruptions that significantly impacted global climate

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Tambora eruption in 1815
2. Krakatoa eruption in 1883
3. Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991
4. Laki eruption in 1783

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hurricane Katrina
6. The Dust Bowl
7. The Great Smog of London
8. The Chernobyl disaster
9. The Black Death
10. The Industrial Revolution
11. The Little Ice Age
12. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD
13. The 2010 Haiti earthquake
14. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami
15. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake
16. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens
17. The 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami
18. The 2019-2020 Australian bushfires
19. The 1986 Lake Nyos disaster
20. The 1995 Chicago heat wave
21. The 1931 China floods
22. The 1970 Bhola cyclone
23. The 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires
24. The 2018 Kilauea eruption

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
