Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Biological processes that deliberately interfere with or block the normal function of genetic material in other organisms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. RNA interference (RNAi) in plants to silence specific genes in invading pathogens
2. CRISPR-Cas9 system used by bacteria to target and degrade viral DNA
3. Horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to outcompete other bacteria
4. Production of bacteriocins by bacteria to inhibit the growth of competing strains

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Photosynthesis in plants
6. Mitosis in eukaryotic cells
7. DNA replication during cell division
8. Enzyme catalysis in metabolic pathways
9. Antibody production in the immune system
10. Neuronal signaling in the brain
11. Hormone regulation in endocrine systems
12. Muscle contraction in animals
13. Seed germination in plants
14. Blood clotting in vertebrates
15. Oxygen transport by hemoglobin
16. Cell membrane transport mechanisms
17. Fermentation in yeast
18. Nitrogen fixation in soil bacteria
19. Apoptosis in multicellular organisms
20. Synaptic plasticity in learning
21. Circadian rhythm regulation
22. Viral replication in host cells
23. Stem cell differentiation
24. Homeostasis in living organisms

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
