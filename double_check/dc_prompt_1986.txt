Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cooking methods that use earth ovens and heated stones

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kalua pork cooked in an imu
2. Hangi-style lamb and vegetables
3. Pachamanca-prepared potatoes
4. Curanto seafood feast

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Grilled steak on charcoal
6. Clay pot chicken
7. Tandoori naan
8. Pit-smoked barbecue
9. Wood-fired pizza
10. Dutch oven stew
11. Campfire s'mores
12. Rotisserie chicken
13. Smoking meat in a smokehouse
14. Solar oven bread
15. Wok-fried noodles
16. Pressure cooker rice
17. Slow-roasted turkey
18. Deep-fried fish
19. Steamed dumplings
20. Microwave popcorn
21. Brick oven bread
22. Spit-roasted lamb
23. Cast iron skillet cornbread
24. Bamboo steamed rice

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
