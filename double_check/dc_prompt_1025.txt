Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or practices that incorporate intricate, handcrafted patterns or movements inspired by cultural traditions and natural phenomena

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a handwoven Persian carpet with floral and geometric motifs
2. a traditional Japanese tea ceremony involving precise, choreographed movements
3. a Maori tattoo (ta moko) featuring intricate spiral patterns
4. a Balinese dance performance with elaborate hand gestures and footwork

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a modern abstract painting
6. a factory-made ceramic vase
7. a minimalist sculpture
8. a digital animation
9. a mass-produced T-shirt
10. a printed poster
11. a 3D-printed figurine
12. a machine-stitched quilt
13. a plastic toy
14. a neon sign
15. a vinyl record
16. a smartphone case
17. a factory-made rug
18. a printed book
19. a mass-produced jewelry set
20. a computer-generated image
21. a molded plastic chair
22. a laser-cut wooden box
23. a printed photograph
24. a factory-made pottery bowl

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
