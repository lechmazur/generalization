Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Works of fiction featuring a protagonist who is a professional or amateur detective investigating a crime while explicitly referencing or engaging with phenomenological concepts or theories.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. In "The Phenomenological Detective," a private investigator uses the concept of intentionality to understand the motives behind a series of art thefts, constantly reflecting on how the thieves perceive the value of the stolen pieces.
2. "The Case of the Embodied Mind" follows a retired police detective who applies Merleau-Ponty's theories of embodiment to solve a murder, focusing on how the physical environment influenced the killer's actions.
3. In "The Husserlian Inquiry," an amateur sleuth delves into a missing person case, employing Husserl's phenomenological reduction to strip away assumptions and focus on the pure experience of the disappearance.
4. "The Existential Enigma" features a detective who uses Sartre's existential phenomenology to investigate a corporate espionage case, exploring how the suspects' sense of freedom and responsibility shapes their actions.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. In "The Mind's Eye," a psychologist uses cognitive theories to solve a series of psychological crimes.
6. "The Rational Detective" follows a logician who applies deductive reasoning to solve a murder mystery.
7. In "The Behavioral Sleuth," a profiler uses behavioral analysis to track down a serial killer.
8. "The Philosophical Thief" involves a thief who steals rare philosophical texts, but no detective is involved.
9. "The Quantum Detective" features a physicist turned detective who uses quantum mechanics to solve crimes.
10. In "The Linguistic Puzzle," a linguist helps solve a kidnapping case by analyzing the language used in ransom notes.
11. "The Historical Whodunit" follows a historian who solves a cold case from the 19th century.
12. In "The Psychological Profile," a detective uses Freudian psychoanalysis to understand a criminal's mind.
13. "The Sociological Sleuth" involves a sociologist who investigates a crime by studying social structures.
14. In "The Ethical Dilemma," a detective grapples with moral philosophy while solving a case.
15. "The Forensic Files" follows a forensic scientist who uses scientific methods to solve crimes.
16. In "The Cultural Conundrum," an anthropologist helps solve a crime by understanding cultural practices.
17. "The Economic Crime" involves a detective who investigates financial fraud using economic theories.
18. In "The Political Plot," a detective uncovers a political conspiracy without referencing phenomenology.
19. "The Technological Trap" follows a cybercrime investigator who uses digital forensics to solve cases.
20. In "The Artistic Mystery," a detective solves a crime involving stolen artworks but does not engage with phenomenology.
21. "The Medical Mystery" involves a doctor who solves a medical-related crime using medical knowledge.
22. In "The Environmental Enigma," a detective investigates an eco-crime using environmental science.
23. "The Psychological Thriller" follows a detective who uses psychological tactics to catch a criminal, but not phenomenology.
24. In "The Historical Heist," a detective solves a crime involving historical artifacts without phenomenological references.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
