Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or devices that rely on intermittent or fluctuating signals to function effectively

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A radio-controlled toy car that operates using a signal that may fluctuate due to interference
2. A wireless speaker that adjusts its volume based on intermittent Bluetooth signals
3. A smart home security system that uses intermittent Wi-Fi signals to send alerts
4. A fitness tracker that relies on fluctuating GPS signals to track movement

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smartphone that uses a stable cellular network
6. A television that receives a continuous cable signal
7. A landline telephone that uses a steady wired connection
8. A digital camera that stores images on a memory card
9. A laptop that connects to the internet via Ethernet
10. A car's GPS navigation system that uses a consistent satellite signal
11. A home thermostat that maintains a constant temperature
12. A microwave oven that heats food using a steady power supply
13. A desktop computer that runs on a reliable power grid
14. A smartwatch that syncs data via a stable Bluetooth connection
15. A drone that uses a continuous video feed for remote piloting
16. A home security camera that records footage on a local hard drive
17. A gaming console that connects to the internet via a wired connection
18. A wireless mouse that uses a stable radio frequency signal
19. A home automation system that uses a reliable Zigbee network
20. A satellite phone that uses a consistent satellite connection
21. A baby monitor that transmits audio via a steady radio signal
22. A smart lock that uses a reliable NFC signal for unlocking
23. A weather station that collects data using a consistent sensor network
24. A virtual reality headset that uses a stable Wi-Fi connection for streaming

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
