Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Items sold in specialty catalogs that focus on sustainable living practices

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. bamboo toothbrushes
2. solar-powered phone chargers
3. reusable beeswax food wraps
4. composting bins with activated charcoal filters

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. plastic water bottles
6. disposable paper plates
7. garden tools
8. camping equipment
9. organic cotton t-shirts
10. recycling bins
11. LED light bulbs
12. reusable shopping bags
13. bicycle accessories
14. natural cleaning products
15. metal straws
16. canvas backpacks
17. glass food containers
18. wooden kitchen utensils
19. cloth napkins
20. water filters
21. energy-efficient appliances
22. biodegradable trash bags
23. hemp clothing
24. rain barrels

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
