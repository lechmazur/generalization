Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that have been used as symbols of resilience in extreme environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a cactus surviving in the desert
2. a lighthouse enduring harsh storms
3. a lone tree growing on a rocky cliff
4. a phoenix rising from ashes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a snowflake
6. a butterfly emerging from a cocoon
7. a mountain peak
8. a river flowing through a canyon
9. a sunflower turning toward the sun
10. a glacier slowly melting
11. a rainbow after a storm
12. a seed sprouting in fertile soil
13. a bird migrating south for the winter
14. a volcano erupting
15. a coral reef teeming with life
16. a spider spinning a web
17. a star shining in the night sky
18. a whale diving into the deep ocean
19. a sand dune shifting in the wind
20. a forest recovering after a wildfire
21. a fish swimming upstream
22. a cloud forming in the sky
23. a rock eroded by water over time
24. a leaf falling from a tree in autumn

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
