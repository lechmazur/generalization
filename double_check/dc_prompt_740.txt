Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological tools or platforms that facilitate the creation or manipulation of virtual environments for educational purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Unity
2. CoSpaces Edu
3. Unreal Engine
4. OpenSimulator

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. PowerPoint
6. Google Classroom
7. Zoom
8. Microsoft Teams
9. Blackboard
10. Canvas LMS
11. Adobe Photoshop
12. Kahoot
13. Quizlet
14. YouTube
15. Moodle
16. Google Docs
17. Prezi
18. Microsoft Word
19. Duolingo
20. Khan Academy
21. Edmodo
22. Schoology
23. Padlet
24. Flipgrid

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
