Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): historical institutions that have inspired fictional settings in literature

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The prison in "The Count of Monte Cristo" inspired by the Ch√¢teau d'If
2. The school in "Harry Potter" inspired by various British boarding schools like Eton College
3. The asylum in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" inspired by the Oregon State Hospital
4. The monastery in "The Name of the Rose" inspired by several medieval monasteries

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A futuristic cityscape in a science fiction novel
6. A mythical kingdom in a fantasy epic
7. A dystopian society in a speculative fiction work
8. A pirate ship in an adventure story
9. A haunted house in a gothic novel
10. A space station in a sci-fi thriller
11. A post-apocalyptic wasteland in a survival narrative
12. A magical forest in a fairy tale
13. A detective's office in a mystery novel
14. A courtroom in a legal drama
15. A battlefield in a war story
16. A spaceship in a space opera
17. A small town in a coming-of-age story
18. A castle in a medieval romance
19. A laboratory in a science fiction horror
20. A train in a suspense thriller
21. A bar in a noir detective story
22. A desert island in an adventure tale
23. A skyscraper in an urban thriller
24. A submarine in a naval adventure

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
