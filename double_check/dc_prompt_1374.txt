Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient monumental stone sculptures that were carved from a single block and weigh over 20 tons

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Great Sphinx of Giza
2. Colossal Olmec Head 1
3. Moai at Rano Raraku
4. Lion of Babylon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Parthenon frieze
6. Terracotta Warriors
7. Venus de Milo
8. Winged Victory of Samothrace
9. Aztec Sun Stone
10. Rosetta Stone
11. Trajan's Column
12. Assyrian lamassu
13. Khmer Buddha statues
14. Olmec jade masks
15. Roman marble sarcophagi
16. Mayan stone reliefs
17. Egyptian obelisks
18. Stonehenge trilithons
19. Zeus at Olympia
20. Serpent Column
21. Babylonian kudurru
22. Persepolis reliefs
23. Etruscan bronze sculptures
24. Minoan stone vessels

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
