Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures over 100 feet tall that harness natural air movement to generate mechanical power

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a wind turbine tower exceeding 100 feet that uses wind to rotate its blades and generate electricity
2. a tall chimney-like structure with internal turbines that harness updrafts from heated air to produce mechanical energy
3. a vertical-axis wind turbine over 100 feet tall designed to capture wind currents at high altitudes
4. a skyscraper-integrated wind funnel system that channels natural breezes to power internal turbines

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a solar panel array on a rooftop
6. a hydroelectric dam
7. a geothermal power plant
8. a tidal energy generator
9. a windmill under 100 feet tall
10. a kite-based wind energy system
11. a solar updraft tower under 100 feet
12. a biomass power plant
13. a wave energy converter
14. a small-scale residential wind turbine
15. a coal-fired power plant
16. a natural gas turbine
17. a nuclear reactor
18. a solar thermal power plant
19. a wind farm with turbines under 100 feet
20. a rooftop rainwater harvesting system
21. a vertical garden on a skyscraper
22. a solar-powered water pump
23. a small wind-powered water desalination unit
24. a residential solar water heater

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
