Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural or natural phenomena that involve the use of fire or light as a central element in rituals, celebrations, or symbolic representations within specific geographic or cultural contexts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Diwali festival in India, where rows of clay lamps are lit to symbolize the victory of light over darkness.
2. The Bonfire Night in the United Kingdom, commemorating the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605 with large bonfires and fireworks.
3. The Lantern Festival in Taiwan, where thousands of lanterns are released into the sky to symbolize letting go of the past.
4. The Inti Raymi festival in Peru, where a ceremonial fire is used to honor the Incan sun god.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The use of candles in a romantic dinner setting.
6. A campfire used for cooking during a camping trip.
7. The Northern Lights, a natural light display in the Earth's sky.
8. A torch used in the Olympic Games to symbolize the passing of the flame from one athlete to another.
9. The use of flashlights in a search and rescue operation.
10. A light bulb used in a household lamp for everyday lighting.
11. The use of fireworks at a New Year's Eve celebration.
12. A bonfire used for warmth during a winter gathering.
13. The use of a laser pointer in a business presentation.
14. A candlelit vigil held in memory of a deceased person.
15. The use of stage lighting in a theater production.
16. A flare used as a distress signal at sea.
17. The use of a match to light a cigarette.
18. A light show projected onto a building during a cultural event.
19. The use of a flashlight in a haunted house attraction.
20. A candle used in a religious ceremony in a church.
21. The use of a sparkler at a birthday party.
22. A light installation in a modern art museum.
23. The use of a headlamp while hiking at night.
24. A fire used for cremation in a funeral ritual.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
