Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things exhibiting a juxtaposition of seemingly contradictory emotional or behavioral traits, where one aspect is overtly displayed while the other is subtly implied or hinted at through secondary cues.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a clown who performs cheerful acts but has a melancholic expression in their eyes
2. a horror movie with a whimsical soundtrack that contrasts with its dark visuals
3. a person who laughs loudly at a joke but subtly clenches their fists in frustration
4. a sunny, vibrant painting with faint, shadowy figures lurking in the background

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a person who is consistently cheerful in all situations
6. a horror movie with a consistently eerie soundtrack
7. a painting that is entirely dark and gloomy
8. a character who is always angry and never shows any other emotion
9. a comedy show with no underlying serious themes
10. a person who openly expresses all their emotions without subtlety
11. a story where all characters are one-dimensional
12. a song with lyrics that match the tone of the music perfectly
13. a movie where the protagonist is purely heroic with no flaws
14. a book where every characterâ€™s emotions are explicitly stated
15. a painting that is entirely bright and cheerful with no hidden elements
16. a person who is always calm and never shows any signs of distress
17. a story where the tone is consistent throughout
18. a character who is purely evil with no redeeming qualities
19. a song with no emotional depth or complexity
20. a movie where the visuals and soundtrack are perfectly aligned in tone
21. a person who is always sad and never shows any happiness
22. a painting that is entirely abstract with no recognizable elements
23. a story where all conflicts are resolved without any ambiguity
24. a character who is purely good with no internal struggles

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
