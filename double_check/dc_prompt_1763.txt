Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional hunting tools used by indigenous Arctic communities for marine mammals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Harpoon with detachable head
2. Toggle harpoon
3. Ice pick
4. Drag float

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bow and arrow
6. Spear
7. Atlatl
8. Boomerang
9. Fishing net
10. Fish hook
11. Snare
12. Deadfall trap
13. Knife
14. Axe
15. Rifle
16. Shotgun
17. Kayak
18. Umiak
19. Snowshoes
20. Dog sled
21. Moccasins
22. Parka
23. Gloves
24. Seal skin float

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
