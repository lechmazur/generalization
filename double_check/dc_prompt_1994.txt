Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made of wood that are used in both culinary and ceremonial contexts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A wooden spoon used for stirring sauces and also in certain rituals for blessing food.
2. A carved wooden bowl used for serving food and also as a vessel for offerings in ceremonies.
3. A wooden pestle used for grinding spices and herbs, and also symbolically in some cultures to represent fertility or prosperity.
4. A wooden platter used for presenting food at feasts and also as a ceremonial object in some indigenous traditions.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A metal spoon
6. A ceramic bowl
7. A stone pestle
8. A plastic platter
9. A wooden chair
10. A wooden table
11. A wooden bed frame
12. A wooden door
13. A wooden fence
14. A wooden toy
15. A wooden sculpture
16. A wooden mask
17. A wooden instrument
18. A wooden box
19. A wooden staff
20. A wooden cane
21. A wooden cross
22. A wooden altar
23. A wooden totem pole
24. A wooden coffin

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
