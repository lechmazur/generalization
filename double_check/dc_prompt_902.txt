Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or entities that are associated with both a significant scientific principle and a major cultural or artistic contribution.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the Fibonacci sequence
2. the Golden Ratio
3. the periodic table
4. the double helix structure of DNA

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the Pythagorean theorem
6. the theory of relativity
7. the Mona Lisa
8. the Sistine Chapel ceiling
9. the concept of zero
10. the invention of the printing press
11. the discovery of penicillin
12. the Eiffel Tower
13. the Great Wall of China
14. the theory of evolution
15. the invention of the light bulb
16. the works of Shakespeare
17. the discovery of gravity
18. the invention of the telephone
19. the Taj Mahal
20. the concept of democracy
21. the invention of the wheel
22. the discovery of electricity
23. the works of Beethoven
24. the invention of the airplane

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
