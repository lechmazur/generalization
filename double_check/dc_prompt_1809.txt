Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): ancient structures built on islands or artificial platforms in the ocean

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Nan Madol
2. Mont Saint-Michel
3. Tyre
4. Fort Boyard

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Machu Picchu
6. Petra
7. Lighthouse of Alexandria
8. Venice
9. Alcatraz Prison
10. Great Wall of China
11. Angkor Wat
12. Stonehenge
13. Easter Island statues
14. Parthenon
15. Pyramids of Giza
16. Taj Mahal
17. Chichen Itza
18. Colosseum
19. Great Zimbabwe
20. Borobudur
21. Teotihuacan
22. Persepolis
23. Acropolis
24. Palmyra

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
