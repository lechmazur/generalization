Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for individual use that incorporate multiple, distinct compartments for organizing small items, each compartment having a dedicated, non-interchangeable lid or closure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A weekly pill organizer with a separate compartment and lid for each day of the week.
2. A fishing tackle box with individual, lidded compartments for different hooks, lures, and weights.
3. A watercolor paint set with small, individual pans of paint, each with its own hinged lid.
4. A sewing box with separate, lidded compartments for needles, pins, buttons, and other small sewing notions.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A backpack with multiple zippered pockets.
6. A toolbox with a single large compartment.
7. A desk drawer organizer with open compartments.
8. A plastic storage bin with a snap-on lid.
9. A filing cabinet with multiple drawers.
10. A shoe organizer hanging over a door.
11. A silverware tray in a kitchen drawer.
12. A muffin tin.
13. An ice cube tray.
14. A spice rack.
15. A makeup bag with various pouches.
16. A wallet with multiple card slots.
17. A key holder with hooks for multiple keys.
18. A pencil case with a single zipper.
19. A jewelry box with a single lid and various compartments.
20. A multi-tiered lunchbox with a single latch.
21. A set of nesting bowls.
22. A set of measuring cups.
23. A roll of plastic wrap with a cutter.
24. A bottle of shampoo with a flip-top cap.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
