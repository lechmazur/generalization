Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Remote mountain monasteries that have continuously produced a single type of food or beverage for over 300 years

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The monks of Tengboche Monastery in Nepal, renowned for their yak butter tea, a staple they have continuously produced for over three centuries.
2. The secluded Ganden Monastery in Tibet, where monks have cultivated and brewed a unique medicinal herbal tea for over 300 years.
3. The isolated SÃ¼mela Monastery in Turkey, where a specific type of honey, harvested from the surrounding cliffs, has been produced continuously by the resident monks for over three centuries.
4. The remote Bhutanese monastery of Taktsang, where monks have been producing a special type of red rice wine for ceremonial purposes for over 300 years.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A family recipe for apple pie passed down for generations.
6. A vineyard in France producing the same wine for over 200 years.
7. A brewery in Germany known for its consistent beer recipe.
8. A specific type of cheese made in a Swiss village for centuries.
9. A remote island community known for its unique fishing methods.
10. A type of bread baked in a small Italian town for over 100 years.
11. A specific coffee bean grown in Colombia for generations.
12. A particular type of olive oil produced in Greece for centuries.
13. A remote village in Japan known for its pottery making tradition.
14. A specific type of silk produced in China for centuries.
15. A monastery known for its illuminated manuscripts.
16. A convent known for its embroidery work.
17. A temple known for its intricate carvings.
18. A shrine known for its annual pilgrimage.
19. A hermitage known for its solitary lifestyle.
20. A community known for its sustainable farming practices.
21. A group of artisans known for their woodworking skills.
22. A family known for its blacksmithing tradition.
23. A town known for its annual music festival.
24. A city known for its historical architecture.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
