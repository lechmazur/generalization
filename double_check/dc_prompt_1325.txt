Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Enclosed spaces or systems designed to facilitate navigation or communication for individuals with sensory impairments.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tactile paving system
2. Braille trail
3. Guide rope tunnel
4. Audio beacon corridor

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Subway station
6. Highway tunnel
7. Shopping mall
8. Elevator shaft
9. Air traffic control tower
10. Underground parking garage
11. Train platform
12. Pedestrian walkway
13. Emergency exit route
14. Hospital corridor
15. School hallway
16. Office cubicle
17. Public restroom
18. Library reading room
19. Concert hall
20. Movie theater
21. Airport terminal
22. Bus shelter
23. Phone booth
24. Greenhouse

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
