Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Countries with a predominantly desert landscape that have a unique geometric shape as a national symbol

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Egypt with the Pyramid as a national symbol
2. Libya with the Star and Crescent in a circular emblem
3. Jordan with the Star of the Hashemite Kingdom
4. Oman with the Khanjar dagger in a circular emblem

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a cactus
6. a sand dune
7. a palm tree
8. a camel
9. a desert fox
10. a mirage
11. a Bedouin tent
12. a scorpion
13. a desert rose
14. a sandstorm
15. a falcon
16. a date palm
17. a desert lizard
18. a nomad
19. a desert oasis
20. a desert eagle
21. a sand viper
22. a desert tortoise
23. a desert hare
24. a desert beetle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
