Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Representations of abstract concepts using visually distinct, anthropomorphic forms with exaggerated features.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A cartoon character depicting Time as a bearded old man with an oversized hourglass body
2. A stylized illustration of Justice as a blindfolded woman with exaggerated scales and sword
3. A personified Death figure with an elongated skeletal form and dramatically flowing dark robes
4. A drawing of Mother Nature as a green-skinned woman with tree branches for hair and flower-covered limbs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Statue of Liberty
6. A corporate logo featuring an eagle
7. A realistic painting of an angel
8. A stone gargoyle
9. An emoji face
10. A traditional religious icon
11. A mascot costume
12. A totem pole carving
13. A constellation diagram
14. A national flag with symbols
15. A hieroglyphic figure
16. A coat of arms
17. A traffic sign stick figure
18. A puppet character
19. A garden gnome
20. A mythological creature statue
21. A weather vane figure
22. A carnival mask
23. A chess piece
24. A decorative weathercock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
