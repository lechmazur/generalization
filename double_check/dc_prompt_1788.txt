Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artifacts from the early 20th century that feature geometric patterns inspired by non-Western cultures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Cubist painting by Pablo Picasso featuring African mask motifs
2. A Wiener Werkst√§tte textile design incorporating Japanese wave patterns
3. A Frank Lloyd Wright stained glass window with Native American geometric designs
4. An Art Deco vase with Egyptian-inspired geometric motifs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A Renaissance painting with religious themes
6. A Baroque sculpture of a mythological figure
7. A Victorian-era floral wallpaper
8. A medieval tapestry depicting a historical battle
9. A Rococo-style mirror with ornate curves
10. A Gothic cathedral with pointed arches
11. A Neoclassical building with Greek columns
12. A Romantic landscape painting
13. A 19th-century Impressionist painting
14. A traditional Chinese porcelain vase
15. A Native American totem pole
16. A Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock print
17. An ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic tablet
18. A Byzantine mosaic of a religious scene
19. A Persian rug with floral patterns
20. A medieval illuminated manuscript
21. A traditional African tribal mask
22. A Mayan calendar stone
23. A Greek amphora with mythological scenes
24. A Roman fresco from Pompeii

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
