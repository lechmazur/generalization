Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Phenomena where discrete, independent units spontaneously self-organize into stable, ordered structures through random interactions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Formation of snowflakes from water molecules
2. Crystallization of salt from a supersaturated solution
3. Flocking behavior of birds
4. Self-assembly of lipid molecules into cell membranes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A line of ants following a pheromone trail
6. The growth of a tree from a seed
7. The formation of a delta at the mouth of a river
8. The development of a fetus in the womb
9. The construction of a termite mound
10. The weaving of a spider web
11. The arrangement of iron filings around a magnet
12. The formation of a rainbow
13. The erosion of a canyon by a river
14. The formation of clouds
15. The organization of a school of fish fleeing a predator
16. The assembly of a car on a production line
17. The formation of a traffic jam
18. The development of mold on bread
19. The arrangement of leaves on a stem
20. The formation of rust on metal
21. The creation of a sand dune by wind
22. The formation of a pearl inside an oyster
23. The development of a hurricane
24. The layering of sedimentary rock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
