Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that are traditionally crafted from natural materials and have a dual purpose of utility and ceremonial significance in specific cultures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Dreamcatcher
2. Japanese tea bowl (Chawan)
3. Native American peace pipe (Calumet)
4. Maori carved wooden canoe (Waka)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Plastic water bottle
6. Electric kettle
7. Porcelain vase
8. Metal frying pan
9. Digital wristwatch
10. Glass wine decanter
11. Stainless steel cutlery
12. Silicone baking mat
13. Plastic toy figurine
14. Aluminum ladder
15. Rubber garden hose
16. Concrete garden statue
17. Polyester sleeping bag
18. Vinyl record
19. LED flashlight
20. Plastic storage bin
21. Metallic keychain
22. Glass chandelier
23. Carbon fiber bicycle
24. Plastic beach ball

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
