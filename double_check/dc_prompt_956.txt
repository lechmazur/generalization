Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that are designed to attach or detach from a larger structure for functional or aesthetic purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a camera lens
2. a modular bookshelf component
3. a car tire
4. a kitchen cabinet door

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a necklace
6. a tree branch
7. a puzzle piece
8. a magnet
9. a button on a shirt
10. a Lego brick
11. a hinge
12. a zipper
13. a screw
14. a Velcro strip
15. a key
16. a USB drive
17. a watch strap
18. a light bulb
19. a battery
20. a nail
21. a paper clip
22. a staple
23. a hook
24. a chain link

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
