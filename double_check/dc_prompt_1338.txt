Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations or discoveries that originated as solutions to competitive or strategic challenges in games, exploration, or artistic expression.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Mersenne Twister, a pseudorandom number generator developed to address shortcomings in existing algorithms for generating random numbers in simulations and games.
2. The development of the foreshortening technique in Renaissance art, driven by the artistic challenge of realistically depicting three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional canvas.
3. The invention of the chronometer, a highly accurate timekeeping device, spurred by the need for precise navigation at sea during long voyages of exploration.
4. The creation of the "Z notation" for formal specification, initially developed to address the challenge of rigorously defining complex computer systems, particularly in the context of competitive software development.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the telescope.
6. The development of perspective in art.
7. The discovery of penicillin.
8. The invention of the printing press.
9. The development of calculus.
10. The discovery of DNA.
11. The invention of the airplane.
12. The development of the internet.
13. The discovery of electricity.
14. The invention of the telephone.
15. The development of photography.
16. The discovery of radioactivity.
17. The invention of the automobile.
18. The development of quantum mechanics.
19. The discovery of the theory of relativity.
20. The invention of the computer.
21. The development of artificial intelligence.
22. The discovery of the Higgs boson.
23. The invention of the smartphone.
24. The development of CRISPR gene editing.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
