Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): musical instruments with names derived from non-English languages and used in traditional folk music

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. sitar
2. balalaika
3. didgeridoo
4. koto

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. guitar
6. piano
7. violin
8. flute
9. drum
10. trumpet
11. saxophone
12. clarinet
13. harp
14. accordion
15. banjo
16. mandolin
17. cello
18. trombone
19. ukulele
20. harmonica
21. bagpipes
22. xylophone
23. marimba
24. tambourine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
