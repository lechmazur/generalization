Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional materials used in historical European musical instruments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Spruce wood
2. Catgut strings
3. Ivory
4. Horsehair

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Plastic
6. Carbon fiber
7. Aluminum
8. Steel strings
9. Silicone
10. Graphite
11. Nylon strings
12. Fiberglass
13. Rubber
14. Polyester
15. Kevlar
16. Vinyl
17. Titanium
18. Polycarbonate
19. Brass
20. Concrete
21. Silk
22. Graphene
23. Resin
24. Foam

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
