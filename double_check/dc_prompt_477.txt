Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems exhibiting emergent complexity arising from the interaction of simple, locally-defined rules within a constrained environment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a flock of birds exhibiting coordinated flight patterns
2. a colony of ants building a complex nest structure
3. a cellular automaton generating intricate patterns from basic rules
4. a traffic system where individual driver behaviors lead to emergent congestion patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a single neuron firing in isolation
6. a clock with gears operating independently
7. a linear equation solving for a single variable
8. a static image of a fractal
9. a single-celled organism dividing
10. a computer executing a pre-programmed script
11. a single domino falling in a chain reaction
12. a molecule of water in a glass
13. a single star in a galaxy
14. a lone wolf hunting prey
15. a single grain of sand on a beach
16. a single note in a musical composition
17. a single pixel on a computer screen
18. a single word in a dictionary
19. a single atom in a crystal lattice
20. a single raindrop in a storm
21. a single thread in a woven fabric
22. a single brick in a wall
23. a single leaf on a tree
24. a single fish swimming in a pond

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
