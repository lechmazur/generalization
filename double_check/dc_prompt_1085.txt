Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that rely on concealment or misdirection to achieve their primary function, while simultaneously revealing or integrating information in a subtle or indirect manner.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. camouflage clothing
2. magic trick
3. stealth aircraft
4. cryptography

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a lighthouse
6. a mirror
7. a magnifying glass
8. a telescope
9. a flashlight
10. a loudspeaker
11. a billboard
12. a neon sign
13. a spotlight
14. a siren
15. a megaphone
16. a searchlight
17. a traffic light
18. a television screen
19. a radio broadcast
20. a public address system
21. a fire alarm
22. a weather vane
23. a GPS device
24. a smoke signal

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
