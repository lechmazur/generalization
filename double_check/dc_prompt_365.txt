Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Visual representations of complex systems that utilize intricate, branching patterns and high contrast to convey information or aesthetic value.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. circuit board diagrams
2. subway system maps
3. neural network visualizations
4. tree ring analysis charts

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. spider webs
6. family trees
7. simple flow charts
8. pie charts
9. bar graphs
10. stick figure drawings
11. architectural blueprints
12. road maps
13. organizational charts
14. weather radar maps
15. constellation diagrams
16. simple sketches
17. topographical maps
18. basic diagrams
19. musical notation
20. chemical structure drawings
21. basic network diagrams
22. simple mind maps
23. population density maps
24. basic timelines

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
