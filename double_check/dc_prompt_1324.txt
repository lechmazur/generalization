Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures that rely on hidden or concealed mechanisms to function effectively, where the primary mechanism is not immediately visible or apparent to an observer.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A magician's trick that uses a hidden compartment in a table to make objects disappear.
2. A vending machine that uses an internal mechanism to dispense products, not visible to the user.
3. A safe with a combination lock that uses a hidden mechanism to secure its contents.
4. An automatic door that uses sensors and motors concealed within its frame to operate.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A transparent glass elevator that shows its internal workings.
6. A bicycle with visible gears and chains.
7. A traditional clock with exposed mechanical parts.
8. A car engine that is visible under the hood.
9. A public water fountain with visible pipes and valves.
10. A computer with a clear case showing its internal components.
11. A mechanical toy where the winding mechanism is visible.
12. A bridge with visible support structures.
13. A musical instrument like a guitar where the strings and mechanics are visible.
14. A traditional loom where the weaving process is visible.
15. A steam engine with visible pistons and cylinders.
16. A wind turbine where the blades and generator are visible.
17. A solar panel where the photovoltaic cells are visible.
18. A traditional camera with visible lens and shutter.
19. A mechanical watch with a visible balance wheel.
20. A crane with visible cables and pulleys.
21. A traditional printing press where the ink and paper movement are visible.
22. A manual typewriter where the keys and hammers are visible.
23. A traditional sewing machine where the needle and bobbin are visible.
24. A mechanical scale where the weights and balance are visible.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
