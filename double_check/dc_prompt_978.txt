Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that are traditionally crafted from natural materials and are used in equestrian activities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Saddle
2. Bridle
3. Riding crop
4. Halter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Horseshoes
6. Stirrups
7. Bit
8. Girth
9. Harness
10. Reins
11. Martingale
12. Breastplate
13. Saddle pad
14. Polo mallet
15. Vaulting surcingle
16. Lunge whip
17. Horse blanket
18. Fly mask
19. Grooming brush
20. Riding boots
21. Helmet
22. Riding gloves
23. Carriage
24. Stable

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
