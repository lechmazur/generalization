Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects with a single shaft that splits into multiple functional prongs or points at one end

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. fork
2. trident
3. garden rake
4. tuning fork

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. spoon
6. knife
7. chopsticks
8. hammer
9. spatula
10. ladle
11. whisk
12. scissors
13. axe
14. crowbar
15. paintbrush
16. pencil
17. umbrella
18. shovel
19. tongs
20. needle
21. drumstick
22. baton
23. golf club
24. walking stick

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
