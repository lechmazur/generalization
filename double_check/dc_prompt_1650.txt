Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Modular building systems designed for children that use interlocking pieces and were first manufactured in Denmark before 1960

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Original LEGO System of Play sets from 1955
2. LEGO Town Plan No. 1 from 1958
3. LEGO Automatic Binding Bricks from 1949
4. LEGO System i Leg wooden blocks from 1955

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Meccano construction sets
6. K'NEX building toys
7. Mega Bloks
8. Lincoln Logs
9. Tinkertoy construction sets
10. Playmobil figures and playsets
11. Erector Set
12. LEGO Duplo blocks
13. Bristle Blocks
14. Wooden unit blocks
15. Magnetix building sets
16. Fischertechnik construction toys
17. Kapla wooden planks
18. Plus-Plus blocks
19. Snap Circuits
20. Brio Builder System
21. Clics construction toys
22. Zometool
23. Geomag magnetic construction sets
24. Waffle Blocks

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
