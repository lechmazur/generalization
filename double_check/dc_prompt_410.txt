Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures made primarily of unfired clay that were intentionally submerged in a body of water as part of a ritual or artistic practice.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A clay statue submerged in a river as part of a religious festival
2. A clay pot placed in a lake during an art installation
3. A clay sculpture sunk in the ocean for a cultural ceremony
4. A clay figure deposited in a pond for a traditional ritual

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A wooden sculpture submerged in a lake for an art project
6. A metal statue placed in a river for a religious ceremony
7. A stone carving sunk in the ocean as part of a ritual
8. A glass bottle thrown into the sea as part of an art piece
9. A ceramic vase placed in a pond for a cultural event
10. A plastic sculpture submerged in a river for an environmental project
11. A paper boat floated on a lake during a festival
12. A wooden raft set adrift in the ocean for a traditional practice
13. A metal coin tossed into a fountain for good luck
14. A stone monument placed in a lake for a historical commemoration
15. A glass sculpture submerged in a pond for an art exhibition
16. A ceramic tile placed in a river as part of a community project
17. A plastic bottle thrown into the sea as part of a protest
18. A wooden effigy floated on a pond during a cultural festival
19. A metal artifact sunk in the ocean for a scientific study
20. A stone statue placed in a river for a memorial service
21. A glass jar submerged in a lake for a time capsule project
22. A ceramic plate placed in a pond for a culinary event
23. A plastic toy thrown into the sea as part of a game
24. A wooden boat set adrift in the ocean for a maritime tradition

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
