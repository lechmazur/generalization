Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ceremonial lighting rituals that involve the sequential illumination of multiple flames while moving in a clockwise direction

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Havdalah ceremony in Judaism, where a braided candle with multiple wicks is lit and blessings are recited, moving clockwise around the table.
2. A Hindu wedding ritual where the couple circles a sacred fire seven times, with the priest lighting small oil lamps arranged in a clockwise circle at each circumambulation.
3. A Wiccan Sabbat celebration where participants light candles arranged in a circle on an altar, starting from the east and moving clockwise, invoking deities associated with each direction.
4. An ancient Celtic ritual where druids lit a series of bonfires on hilltops, moving clockwise to symbolize the sun's path and invoke blessings for the community.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lighting a single candle on a birthday cake.
6. Lighting a bonfire for a summer solstice celebration.
7. Using a lighter to ignite a gas stove burner.
8. Switching on a string of Christmas lights.
9. Lighting incense sticks in a temple.
10. The Olympic torch relay.
11. Lighting a menorah during Hanukkah, starting from the rightmost candle.
12. Lighting a kinara during Kwanzaa.
13. A Diwali celebration with the lighting of numerous oil lamps.
14. Lighting candles on a church altar.
15. Using a fire starter to build a campfire.
16. Lighting a pilot light on a furnace.
17. Turning on a gas fireplace.
18. Lighting a candle during a power outage.
19. Using a match to light a cigarette.
20. Lighting a tiki torch for a luau.
21. Burning sage for a cleansing ritual.
22. Lighting a prayer candle in a cathedral.
23. A candlelight vigil.
24. Lighting fireworks on New Year's Eve.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
