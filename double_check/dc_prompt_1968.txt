Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations in music recording that emerged during the transition from analog to digital formats

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ADAT
2. Dolby SR
3. DASH
4. dbx noise reduction

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. phonograph cylinder
6. vinyl record
7. 8-track tape
8. cassette tape
9. MP3
10. MIDI keyboard
11. electric guitar pickup
12. condenser microphone
13. vacuum tube amplifier
14. mixing console
15. reel-to-reel tape
16. streaming platform
17. digital audio workstation
18. auto-tune
19. drum machine
20. synthesizer
21. audio interface
22. CD player
23. speaker system
24. audio compressor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
