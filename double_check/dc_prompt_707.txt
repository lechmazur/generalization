Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures that facilitate cyclical processes of transformation and renewal through interconnected networks.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The lymphatic system
2. A coral reef ecosystem
3. The carbon cycle
4. The water cycle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A conveyor belt
6. A subway system
7. A food web
8. A computer network
9. A recycling plant
10. A circular economy
11. A power grid
12. A supply chain
13. A social network
14. A digestive system
15. A highway system
16. A postal service
17. A river system
18. A telephone network
19. A factory assembly line
20. A banking system
21. A waste management system
22. A public transportation network
23. A library system
24. A weather system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
