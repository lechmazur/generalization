Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations where a major cultural performance venue was built directly on top of a body of water

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, Singapore
2. Harpa Concert Hall, Reykjavík, Iceland
3. Sydney Opera House, Australia (parts of it are built over the water)
4. Kölner Philharmonie, Cologne, Germany (portion built over a reflecting pool connected to the Rhine)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York City
6. The Kennedy Center, Washington D.C.
7. Royal Albert Hall, London
8. Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles
9. Carnegie Hall, New York City
10. Metropolitan Opera House, New York City
11. Teatro alla Scala, Milan
12. Sydney Harbour Bridge
13. Burj Khalifa, Dubai
14. The Louvre Museum, Paris
15. The British Museum, London
16. National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.
17. Floating Stage, Bregenz, Austria (temporary stage on a lake)
18. Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow
19. National Theatre, Prague
20. Burgtheater, Vienna
21. Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles
22. Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Colorado
23. Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Spain
24. Musée d'Orsay, Paris (former train station on the Seine)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
