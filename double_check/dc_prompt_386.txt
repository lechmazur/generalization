Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize a feedback loop to adjust a physical action towards a desired equilibrium state, where the action directly manipulates the physical environment causing the change in the measured state.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a thermostat regulating room temperature
2. a cruise control system in a car
3. an autopilot system in an aircraft
4. a robotic arm adjusting its position based on sensor feedback

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wind turbine generating electricity
6. a solar panel converting sunlight into energy
7. a manual dimmer switch for lights
8. a water wheel powering a mill
9. a pendulum clock keeping time
10. a manual thermostat with no feedback loop
11. a hand-cranked generator
12. a manual irrigation system
13. a mechanical lever
14. a bicycle chain transferring power
15. a manual gear shift in a car
16. a manual valve controlling water flow
17. a manual steering wheel in a car
18. a manual brake system
19. a manual camera focus ring
20. a manual volume knob on a stereo
21. a manual lawnmower
22. a manual typewriter
23. a manual coffee grinder
24. a manual hand pump

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
