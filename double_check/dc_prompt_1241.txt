Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural or historical events that involve the use of symbolic attire or regalia to convey identity, resistance, or tradition.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The wearing of kilts by Scottish clans during cultural festivals
2. The use of white dresses by suffragettes during marches
3. Maori haka performances with traditional attire
4. Native American headdresses worn during powwows

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The use of uniforms by military personnel
6. Wearing a suit to a business meeting
7. Donning a lab coat in a scientific laboratory
8. Wearing a wedding dress at a ceremony
9. Sporting a team jersey at a sports event
10. Wearing a Halloween costume
11. Putting on a graduation cap and gown
12. Wearing a chef's hat in a kitchen
13. Donning a Santa suit during Christmas
14. Wearing a firefighter's uniform
15. Wearing a judge's robe in court
16. Wearing a doctor's scrubs in a hospital
17. Wearing a beekeeper's suit
18. Wearing a spacesuit during a spacewalk
19. Wearing a clown costume at a circus
20. Wearing a ballet tutu during a performance
21. Wearing a wetsuit for scuba diving
22. Wearing a cowboy hat at a rodeo
23. Wearing a referee's uniform during a game
24. Wearing a kimono at a Japanese tea ceremony

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
