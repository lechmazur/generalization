Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that utilize curvature to enhance structural integrity or aesthetic appeal in architectural design.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gothic cathedral vaulted ceiling
2. Sydney Opera House shells
3. Guggenheim Museum spiral
4. St. Louis Gateway Arch

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. concrete highway barrier
6. glass skyscraper facade
7. wooden garden trellis
8. stone garden wall
9. steel support beam
10. brick chimney stack
11. aluminum window frame
12. marble column
13. copper roof tiles
14. granite foundation blocks
15. wrought iron gate
16. ceramic floor tiles
17. stained glass window
18. wooden door frame
19. concrete foundation slab
20. metal staircase railing
21. slate roof shingles
22. glass skylight panel
23. stone garden path
24. wooden deck boards

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
