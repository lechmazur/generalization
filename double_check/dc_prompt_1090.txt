Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artworks or systems that use repetitive, rule-based actions to create emergent, unpredictable patterns or outcomes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a cellular automaton simulation
2. a musical composition using algorithmic processes
3. a generative art piece based on fractal geometry
4. a weaving pattern created by a programmed loom

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a painting of a landscape
6. a sculpture of a human figure
7. a photograph of a city skyline
8. a traditional oil painting
9. a hand-drawn comic strip
10. a clay pottery vase
11. a charcoal sketch of a still life
12. a watercolor painting of flowers
13. a bronze statue of an animal
14. a pencil drawing of a portrait
15. a digital illustration of a fantasy scene
16. a graffiti mural on a wall
17. a stained glass window in a church
18. a mosaic made of colored tiles
19. a hand-embroidered tapestry
20. a wood carving of a tree
21. a chalk drawing on a sidewalk
22. a collage made from magazine cutouts
23. a sand sculpture on a beach
24. a papier-mâché mask

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
