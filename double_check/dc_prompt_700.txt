Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural celebrations that mark the beginning of spring and involve fire rituals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chaharshanbe Suri
2. Up Helly Aa
3. Beltane Fire Festival
4. Holika Dahan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Chinese New Year
6. Diwali
7. Summer Solstice
8. Lantern Festival
9. Easter
10. May Day
11. Cherry Blossom Festival
12. Carnival
13. Songkran
14. Holi
15. Guy Fawkes Night
16. Winter Solstice
17. Passover
18. Midsummer Festival
19. Harvest Festival
20. Dragon Boat Festival
21. Nowruz
22. Imbolc
23. Vesak
24. Samhain

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
