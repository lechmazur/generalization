Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena characterized by persistent, large-scale atmospheric vortices

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Great Red Spot on Jupiter
2. Saturn's North Polar Hexagon
3. Neptune's Great Dark Spot
4. Venus's polar vortex

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. waterspout
6. dust devil
7. fire whirl
8. steam devil
9. snow devil
10. Hadley cell
11. trade winds
12. jet stream
13. ocean gyre
14. whirlpool
15. tornado
16. hurricane
17. typhoon
18. cyclone
19. eddy current
20. maelstrom
21. solar flare
22. aurora borealis
23. plasma vortex
24. magnetic field reversal

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
