Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural disasters that resulted in significant changes to Earth's physical geography

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980
2. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami
3. The formation of the Hawaiian Islands
4. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871
6. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912
7. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s
8. The Black Death pandemic in the 14th century
9. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986
10. The Great Depression of the 1930s
11. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989
12. The invention of the printing press
13. The Industrial Revolution
14. The American Civil War
15. The discovery of penicillin
16. The Renaissance period
17. The French Revolution
18. The signing of the Magna Carta
19. The Apollo 11 moon landing
20. The invention of the internet
21. The fall of the Roman Empire
22. The construction of the Panama Canal
23. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
24. The discovery of electricity

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
