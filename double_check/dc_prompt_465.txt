Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to contain or display a collection of small, naturally occurring, hard-shelled items, where the container's design is inspired by natural forms unrelated to the items contained.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A seashell-shaped glass bowl filled with pebbles
2. A leaf-shaped ceramic dish displaying polished stones
3. A pinecone-inspired wooden box holding acorns
4. A flower petal-shaped metal tray containing seed pods

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A woven basket holding marbles
6. A glass jar of seashells
7. A wooden box storing buttons
8. A plastic container of beads
9. A metal tin holding coins
10. A decorative bowl of artificial stones
11. A shell-shaped soap dish
12. A leaf-shaped serving platter
13. A butterfly-shaped jewelry box
14. A rock collection display case
15. A geometric pattern bowl holding nuts
16. A carved wooden box of dried beans
17. A crystal dish holding candy
18. An origami box containing paper clips
19. A ceramic pot filled with dried corn
20. A bamboo container holding chestnuts
21. A porcelain dish displaying pearls
22. A modern minimalist bowl of pebbles
23. A traditional wooden box storing seeds
24. A decorative glass vessel holding shells

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
