Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems exhibiting emergent complex behavior arising from simple, locally interacting agents following deterministic rules.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Traffic flow patterns in a city
2. Ant colony behavior
3. Cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life
4. Flocking behavior in birds

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ecosystem dynamics
6. Neural networks
7. Weather systems
8. Stock market fluctuations
9. Human social networks
10. Chemical reactions
11. Quantum entanglement
12. Internet traffic
13. Genetic algorithms
14. Robotic swarms
15. Cloud computing
16. Urban planning
17. Economic systems
18. Language evolution
19. Traffic light systems
20. Public transportation networks
21. Supply chain logistics
22. Electrical grids
23. Water distribution systems
24. Telecommunication networks

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
