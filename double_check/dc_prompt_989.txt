Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Processes that involve transformation or alteration of a state or structure to achieve a specific goal or outcome

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. baking bread from raw ingredients
2. refining crude oil into gasoline
3. composting organic waste into fertilizer
4. smelting iron ore into steel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a caterpillar becoming a butterfly
6. water evaporating from a puddle
7. leaves changing color in autumn
8. ice melting in the sun
9. a chemical reaction
10. erosion of rocks
11. photosynthesis
12. cellular respiration
13. digestion
14. rust forming on metal
15. DNA replication
16. protein synthesis
17. radioactive decay
18. continental drift
19. star formation
20. volcanic eruption
21. weather patterns
22. plant growth
23. wound healing
24. muscle development

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
