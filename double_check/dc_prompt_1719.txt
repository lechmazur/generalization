Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Italian women born in the 20th century who became internationally recognized in their respective fields of journalism, literature, or music

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Oriana Fallaci
2. Dacia Maraini
3. Mina Mazzini
4. Franca Sozzani

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Leonardo da Vinci
6. Andrea Bocelli
7. Giovanni Boccaccio
8. Enrico Caruso
9. Giorgio Armani
10. Luciano Pavarotti
11. Michelangelo
12. Giuseppe Verdi
13. Federico Fellini
14. Guglielmo Marconi
15. Rita Levi-Montalcini
16. Gianni Versace
17. Alessandro Manzoni
18. Gina Lollobrigida
19. Roberto Benigni
20. Francesco Totti
21. Silvio Berlusconi
22. Giorgio Moroder
23. Anna Magnani
24. Marcello Mastroianni

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
