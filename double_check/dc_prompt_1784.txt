Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Human emotions or traits that are often perceived as flaws but can be endearing or attractive when expressed in moderation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Clumsiness
2. Shyness
3. Sarcasm
4. Pessimism

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Kindness
6. Intelligence
7. Bravery
8. Confidence
9. Generosity
10. Honesty
11. Patience
12. Humor
13. Optimism
14. Assertiveness
15. Creativity
16. Enthusiasm
17. Resilience
18. Forgiveness
19. Empathy
20. Self-control
21. Diligence
22. Ambition
23. Loyalty
24. Passion

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
