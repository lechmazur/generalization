Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Coastal tourist destinations that were originally established as medieval medical treatment centers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Scarborough, England
2. Brighton, England
3. Margate, England
4. Southend-on-Sea, England

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bath, England
6. Cannes, France
7. Miami Beach, Florida
8. Ibiza, Spain
9. Mykonos, Greece
10. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
11. Barbados
12. Phuket, Thailand
13. Bora Bora, French Polynesia
14. Maldives
15. Dubai, UAE
16. Cape Town, South Africa
17. Sydney, Australia
18. San Diego, California
19. Acapulco, Mexico
20. Monte Carlo, Monaco
21. Nice, France
22. Naples, Italy
23. Lisbon, Portugal
24. Barcelona, Spain

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
