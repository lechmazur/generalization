Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize cyclical processes to maintain equilibrium and ensure continuity in both natural and artificial environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The human respiratory system
2. A building's HVAC temperature control
3. The carbon cycle in an ecosystem
4. A nuclear power plant's cooling system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A pendulum clock
6. A washing machine
7. A bicycle wheel
8. A revolving door
9. A merry-go-round
10. A ceiling fan
11. A water mill
12. A record player
13. A ferris wheel
14. A blender
15. A car engine
16. A windmill
17. A potter's wheel
18. A carousel
19. A spinning top
20. A hamster wheel
21. A rotary phone dial
22. A propeller
23. A mechanical watch
24. A turbine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
