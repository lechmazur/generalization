Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical installations of kinetic light art permanently displayed in public transportation systems worldwide.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Leo Villareal's "Multiverse" at the Muni Metro Embarcadero Station in San Francisco
2. Robert Wilson's "Light Clock" at Zurich Hauptbahnhof
3. Jason Bruges Studio's "Digital Ornithology" at the Fulton Center in New York City
4. Nari Ward's "Amazing Grace" at the 167th Street station in New York City (while incorporating light, the kinetic element is debatable and may not fully satisfy the prompt)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Olafur Eliasson's "The Weather Project" at the Tate Modern
6. James Turrell's "Roden Crater"
7. Anish Kapoor's "Cloud Gate" in Chicago
8. A digital billboard displaying advertisements
9. A neon sign in a subway station
10. Streetlights along a bus route
11. A light projection on the side of a building visible from a train
12. Kinetic sculptures in a museum
13. A mobile hanging in an airport
14. A temporary light installation for a festival in a train station
15. Dan Flavin's fluorescent light installations
16. Leo Villareal's "The Bay Lights" on the Bay Bridge
17. A decorative chandelier in a grand central station
18. Electronic train arrival/departure boards
19. Light and sound show at a concert venue near a public transit stop
20. Interactive light displays in a children's museum accessible by public transport
21. A bus with LED lights decorating its exterior
22. A holographic projection in a shopping mall connected to a subway station
23. A water fountain with synchronized lights in a public park near a bus stop
24. Christmas lights decorating a city center during the holidays, viewable from public transit

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
