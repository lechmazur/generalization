Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that fundamentally altered human auditory experiences by introducing new ways to perceive or manipulate sound.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The phonautograph
2. The electric guitar
3. Magnetic tape recording
4. The cochlear implant

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the piano
6. Development of musical notation
7. The creation of the symphony orchestra
8. The invention of the flute
9. The development of opera
10. The invention of the harpsichord
11. The creation of the pipe organ
12. The development of jazz music
13. The invention of the violin
14. The creation of electronic music synthesizers (general synthesizers, not a specific groundbreaking one)
15. The development of audio compression algorithms (general algorithms, not a specific format like MP3)
16. The invention of the radio
17. The development of stereo sound
18. The invention of the telephone
19. The creation of surround sound systems
20. The development of noise-cancelling headphones
21. The invention of the gramophone
22. The creation of digital audio workstations (DAWs)
23. The development of streaming music services
24. The invention of the microphone

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
