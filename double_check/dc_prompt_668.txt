Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Activities or objects that require a unique skill set or knowledge to perform or understand, often associated with niche communities or subcultures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Competitive lockpicking
2. Restoring antique clocks
3. Brewing traditional mead
4. Playing the theremin

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Playing the piano
6. Baking a cake
7. Learning a new language
8. Playing chess
9. Writing a novel
10. Painting a landscape
11. Building a birdhouse
12. Solving a Rubik's cube
13. Knitting a sweater
14. Playing video games
15. Gardening
16. Cooking a gourmet meal
17. Learning to code
18. Playing a sport
19. Collecting stamps
20. Building a model airplane
21. Learning calligraphy
22. Playing a musical instrument
23. Performing magic tricks
24. Creating digital art

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
