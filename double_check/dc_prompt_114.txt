Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): chemical bonds or interactions that are stronger than typical van der Waals forces but weaker than covalent or ionic bonds

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. hydrogen bond
2. pi stacking interaction
3. cation-pi interaction
4. dipole-dipole interaction

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. covalent bond
6. ionic bond
7. metallic bond
8. London dispersion forces
9. van der Waals forces
10. hydrophobic interaction
11. salt bridge
12. disulfide bond
13. coordinate covalent bond
14. peptide bond
15. ester bond
16. phosphodiester bond
17. sigma bond
18. pi bond
19. electrostatic interaction
20. hydrophilic interaction
21. ionic lattice
22. covalent network
23. metallic lattice
24. hydrogen molecule (H2)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
