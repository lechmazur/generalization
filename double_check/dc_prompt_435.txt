Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or artifacts designed to amplify a small initial input into a significantly larger output through a non-linear, cascading effect.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a nuclear chain reaction
2. a Rube Goldberg machine
3. a hydraulic press
4. an avalanche

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a megaphone
6. a telescope
7. a microscope
8. a hearing aid
9. a pulley system
10. a lever
11. a magnifying glass
12. a speaker system
13. a radio antenna
14. a signal booster
15. a battery
16. an electrical transformer
17. a microphone
18. binoculars
19. a car jack
20. a gear system
21. a water pump
22. an air compressor
23. a satellite dish
24. a power drill

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
