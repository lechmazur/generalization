Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made of glass that are intentionally fragmented for artistic or symbolic purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A shattered glass sculpture representing the fragility of memory
2. A mosaic made from broken stained glass depicting a religious scene
3. A broken glass bottle incorporated into a mixed-media artwork symbolizing lost love
4. A ceremonial breaking of a glass at a Jewish wedding

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A stained glass window in a cathedral
6. A glass vase
7. A glass drinking cup
8. A glass magnifying glass
9. A glass bead necklace
10. A glass paperweight
11. A glass eye
12. A glass doorknob
13. A glass chandelier
14. A glass Christmas ornament
15. A broken window pane from an accident
16. A pile of broken glass shards from a dropped dish
17. A cracked phone screen
18. A piece of sea glass smoothed by the ocean
19. A glass prism
20. A glass test tube
21. A glass thermometer
22. A glass lens for a camera
23. A fiberglass boat hull
24. A piece of volcanic glass (obsidian)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
