Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional tools used by indigenous peoples for illumination and heating in cold climates

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Seal oil lamps
2. Quilliq
3. Soapstone lamps
4. Driftwood fires

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Kerosene lamp
6. Electric heater
7. Wood stove
8. Fireplace
9. Candle
10. Solar panel
11. Geothermal vent
12. Fur clothing
13. Igloo
14. Underground dwelling
15. Central heating
16. Propane torch
17. Flashlight
18. Campfire
19. Bonfire
20. Tinder
21. Flint and steel
22. Torch
23. Charcoal
24. Hand warmer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
