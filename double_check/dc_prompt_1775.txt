Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Urban infrastructure elements that manage heat distribution or dissipation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ventilation shafts
2. cooling towers
3. heat sinks
4. thermal vents

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. traffic lights
6. power lines
7. storm drains
8. subway tunnels
9. water towers
10. street lamps
11. manhole covers
12. fire hydrants
13. telephone poles
14. bus shelters
15. parking meters
16. garbage bins
17. bike racks
18. public benches
19. road signs
20. utility boxes
21. security cameras
22. crosswalks
23. guardrails
24. traffic barriers

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
