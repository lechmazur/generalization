Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): architectural or design elements that incorporate both symmetry and asymmetry to create a sense of balance and harmony within a structured space

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a building facade with symmetrical windows and an asymmetrical entrance
2. a garden layout with symmetrical hedges and asymmetrical flower beds
3. a room with a symmetrical chandelier and asymmetrical furniture arrangement
4. a bridge design with symmetrical arches and asymmetrical support beams

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a perfectly symmetrical cathedral
6. a completely asymmetrical modern art sculpture
7. a circular table with evenly spaced chairs
8. a random arrangement of rocks in a zen garden
9. a grid-based city street layout
10. a spiral staircase with no symmetry
11. a mirrored hallway with identical reflections
12. a chaotic abstract painting with no balance
13. a perfectly symmetrical butterfly
14. a single tree in the middle of a field
15. a uniform row of identical houses
16. a completely asymmetrical treehouse
17. a symmetrical snowflake
18. a random pile of bricks
19. a perfectly balanced scale
20. a symmetrical chessboard
21. a lopsided bookshelf
22. a symmetrical starfish
23. a random scattering of leaves
24. a perfectly symmetrical pyramid

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
