Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures that were deliberately designed to be temporary homes for wandering populations but ended up becoming permanent settlements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Refugee camps established after World War II, some of which still exist today
2. Mining towns initially built with temporary housing that transitioned into permanent communities
3. Military outposts in frontier regions that evolved into settled towns and cities
4. Labor camps for large construction projects, like dams or railroads, that later became established settlements

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A nomadic yurt
6. A recreational vehicle (RV)
7. A cruise ship
8. A hotel
9. A summer cottage
10. A medieval castle
11. A college dormitory
12. A prison
13. A hospital
14. An embassy
15. A tent used for camping
16. A shanty town built without planning permission
17. A planned city built from scratch
18. A ghost town abandoned after a gold rush
19. A seasonal ski resort
20. A research station in Antarctica
21. An oil rig
22. A traveling circus
23. A pop-up shop
24. A temporary art installation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
