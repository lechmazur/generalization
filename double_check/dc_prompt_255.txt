Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Symbols used in religious or spiritual contexts that incorporate an eye as a central element to represent divine watchfulness or omniscience.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Eye of Providence on the Great Seal of the United States
2. The Eye of Horus in ancient Egyptian mythology
3. The Dharmachakra, or Wheel of Dharma, in Buddhism which often includes an eye at its center
4. The Hamsa hand with an eye in the center, used in Middle Eastern and North African cultures

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A crucifix
6. The Star of David
7. The Om symbol in Hinduism
8. The yin-yang symbol
9. The lotus flower in various Eastern religions
10. The crescent moon and star in Islam
11. The menorah in Judaism
12. The swastika in ancient Indian religions
13. The ankh in Egyptian mythology
14. The trident of Shiva in Hinduism
15. The pentacle in Wicca
16. The Ichthys or Jesus fish in Christianity
17. The Dharma wheel without an eye
18. The caduceus, symbol of Hermes
19. The Vajra in Tibetan Buddhism
20. The Thor's Hammer in Norse mythology
21. The Celtic cross
22. The Shinto torii gate
23. The Zoroastrian Faravahar
24. The Baháʼí nine-pointed star

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
