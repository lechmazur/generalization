Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize cyclical processes to transform waste material into a valuable resource within a contained environment.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Aquaponics system that recycles fish waste to nourish plants, with water being continuously filtered and reused within the system.
2. Anaerobic digester that converts organic waste into biogas and nutrient-rich digestate, used within a closed-loop farm system.
3. Composting toilet system that transforms human waste into compost for use in gardening, all within a self-contained unit.
4. Closed-loop industrial process that recycles manufacturing byproducts into raw materials for new production cycles within the same facility.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Recycling program that collects plastic bottles from households and processes them into new products.
6. A wastewater treatment plant that cleans sewage before releasing it into a river.
7. Landfill gas recovery system that captures methane from decomposing waste for energy production.
8. Composting facility that processes yard waste into soil amendment, but the process is not contained within a single environment.
9. A solar panel system that converts sunlight into electricity, with no waste transformation involved.
10. Industrial process that uses waste heat to preheat incoming air, but does not transform the waste into a resource.
11. A car engine that recycles exhaust gases to improve fuel efficiency, but does not transform the waste into a valuable resource.
12. A rainwater harvesting system that collects and stores water for later use, but does not involve transformation of waste.
13. A bioreactor that uses bacteria to break down pollutants in soil, but the process is not contained within a single environment.
14. A wind turbine that generates electricity from wind energy, with no waste transformation involved.
15. A recycling center that sorts and processes various materials, but the process is not contained within a single environment.
16. A hydroelectric dam that generates electricity from water flow, with no waste transformation involved.
17. A geothermal system that uses heat from the earth to provide heating and cooling, but does not transform waste into a resource.
18. A municipal composting program that collects food waste from residents and processes it into compost, but the process is not contained within a single environment.
19. An industrial process that uses catalysts to break down pollutants in exhaust gases, but does not transform the waste into a valuable resource.
20. A tidal energy system that generates electricity from the movement of tides, with no waste transformation involved.
21. A recycling program that collects and processes aluminum cans into new products, but the process is not contained within a single environment.
22. A biomass power plant that burns wood chips to generate electricity, but does not involve a cyclical process within a contained environment.
23. A graywater system that recycles water from showers and sinks for use in toilet flushing, but does not transform waste into a valuable resource.
24. A nuclear power plant that generates electricity from nuclear reactions, with no waste transformation involved.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
