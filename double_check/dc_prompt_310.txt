Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical compositions incorporating rhythmic patterns derived from the movements of specific martial arts forms.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. "Tai Chi Symphony" by Tan Dun
2. "Capoeira Rhythms Suite" by Hermeto Pascoal
3. "Wing Chun Concerto" by Bright Sheng
4. "Karate Kata in Five Movements" by Toshio Hosokawa

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. "Combat Dance" by John Cage
6. "Warrior's Path" by Philip Glass
7. "Shaolin Meditation" by Zhou Long
8. "Fight Night" by Hans Zimmer
9. "Traditional Kendo Drums"
10. "Boxing Ring Overture" by Aaron Copland
11. "Martial Symphony" by Igor Stravinsky
12. "Ancient Battle" by Yo-Yo Ma
13. "Dojo Meditation" by Brian Eno
14. "Samurai's Honor" by Joe Hisaishi
15. "Temple Warriors" by Steve Reich
16. "Combat Sports Suite" by Michael Nyman
17. "Traditional Sumo Drums"
18. "Warrior Dance" by Béla Bartók
19. "Fight Scene" by Ennio Morricone
20. "Martial Arts Movie Theme" by Lalo Schifrin
21. "Training Montage" by Bill Conti
22. "Sparring Match" by John Williams
23. "Kung Fu Fighting" by Carl Douglas
24. "Enter the Dragon Theme" by Lalo Schifrin

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
