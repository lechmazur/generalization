Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that are traditionally associated with anonymity or concealment but are used in cultural or celebratory contexts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. masks worn during Carnival celebrations
2. anonymous street art or graffiti
3. veils worn in traditional wedding ceremonies
4. hooded robes in graduation ceremonies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a detective's magnifying glass
6. a spy's hidden camera
7. a disguise kit
8. a secret diary
9. a locked treasure chest
10. a private investigator's badge
11. a surveillance drone
12. a fingerprint scanner
13. a password-protected vault
14. a coded message
15. a hidden compartment in furniture
16. a pair of binoculars
17. a security camera
18. a disguise wig
19. a secret handshake
20. a cloaking device
21. a private jet
22. a safe deposit box
23. a fingerprint dusting kit
24. a pair of sunglasses

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
