Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): vehicles designed by automotive engineers who also founded their own car companies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Aston Martin DB2
2. Lamborghini 350 GT
3. Porsche 356
4. Ferrari 125 S

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ford Model T
6. Chevrolet Corvette
7. Toyota Camry
8. Honda Civic
9. Volkswagen Beetle
10. BMW 3 Series
11. Mercedes-Benz S-Class
12. Tesla Model S
13. Nissan GT-R
14. McLaren F1
15. Bugatti Chiron
16. Koenigsegg Agera
17. Pagani Zonda
18. Rolls-Royce Phantom
19. Bentley Continental GT
20. Maserati GranTurismo
21. Alfa Romeo Giulia
22. Lancia Stratos
23. DeLorean DMC-12
24. Tucker 48

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
