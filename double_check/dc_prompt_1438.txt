Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geological formations or landmarks that have been used as religious pulpits or preaching platforms throughout recorded history

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Uluru (Ayers Rock) in Australia, used by Indigenous Australians for spiritual ceremonies and storytelling
2. Mount Sinai in Egypt, where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments
3. Adam's Peak in Sri Lanka, a pilgrimage site for multiple religions and a platform for spiritual teachings
4. Devil's Tower in Wyoming, USA, a sacred site for Native American tribes used for prayer and rituals

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the Great Pyramid of Giza
6. Stonehenge
7. the Colosseum in Rome
8. Machu Picchu
9. the Parthenon in Athens
10. the Taj Mahal
11. the Eiffel Tower
12. the Statue of Liberty
13. the Leaning Tower of Pisa
14. the Sydney Opera House
15. the Golden Gate Bridge
16. the Burj Khalifa
17. the Great Wall of China
18. the Sphinx
19. the Acropolis
20. the Kremlin
21. the Forbidden City
22. the Alhambra
23. the Angkor Wat temple complex
24. the Petra archaeological site

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
