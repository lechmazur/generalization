Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Capital cities in Africa located on the coast

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Luanda
2. Accra
3. Maputo
4. Dakar

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Kinshasa
6. Harare
7. Abuja
8. Rabat
9. Khartoum
10. Gaborone
11. Juba
12. Asmara
13. Bangui
14. Yaound√©
15. Dodoma
16. Ouagadougou
17. Kampala
18. Windhoek
19. Libreville
20. Antananarivo
21. Freetown
22. Conakry
23. Monrovia
24. Moroni

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
