Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural practices or rituals that involve deliberately compressing or flattening the earth to mark territory or demonstrate power

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stomping grounds during a Native American powwow
2. Creating a sumo wrestling ring
3. Leveling the earth for a threshing floor in ancient agriculture
4. Preparing the clay surface for a Kabaddi court

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Building a sandcastle
6. Laying a brick pathway
7. Rolling out dough for a pie
8. Ironing a shirt
9. Paving a road
10. Creating a foundation for a house
11. Packing down snow for a snowman
12. Tamping coffee grounds
13. Flattening cardboard for recycling
14. Smoothing wet cement
15. Grooming a baseball field
16. Mowing a lawn
17. Digging a grave
18. Plowing a field
19. Building a terrace farm
20. Creating a landfill
21. Erecting a monument
22. Drawing a line in the sand
23. Building a dam
24. Landscaping a garden

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
