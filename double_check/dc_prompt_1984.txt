Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic techniques used in the 16th century that involve the manipulation of light and shadow to enhance visual depth and emotional impact.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The use of sfumato in the Mona Lisa's facial features
2. Titian's application of chiaroscuro in Venus of Urbino
3. Tintoretto's dramatic tenebrism in The Last Supper
4. Holbein's controlled contrast in The Ambassadors

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Pointillism in Seurat's paintings
6. Bronze casting techniques
7. Fresco painting methods
8. Gothic stained glass windows
9. Woodblock printing
10. Gold leaf application
11. Tempera paint mixing
12. Medieval manuscript illumination
13. Stone carving techniques
14. Tapestry weaving methods
15. Mosaic tile placement
16. Watercolor washes
17. Egg tempera preparation
18. Marble sculpting
19. Panel painting preparation
20. Ceramic glazing
21. Metalpoint drawing
22. Ivory carving
23. Enamel work
24. Glass blowing techniques

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
