Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products that were discontinued due to safety concerns but later reintroduced with significant design modifications.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tylenol capsules
2. Fisher-Price Rock 'n Play Sleeper
3. Samsung Galaxy Note 7
4. Vioxx

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ford Pinto
6. Coca-Cola Classic
7. Google Glass
8. Crystal Pepsi
9. Microsoft Zune
10. Betamax
11. New Coke
12. DeLorean DMC-12
13. Segway
14. Palm Pilot
15. Polaroid Instant Camera
16. Hoverboard
17. Windows Vista
18. HD DVD
19. Nintendo Virtual Boy
20. Apple Newton
21. Clairol Touch of Yogurt Shampoo
22. WebTV
23. Amazon Fire Phone
24. Sony MiniDisc

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
