Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural artifacts or phenomena that are traditionally associated with specific celestial events or natural light phenomena and are deeply tied to the identity or rituals of a particular community.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the Stonehenge alignment with the summer solstice sunrise
2. the Inti Raymi festival celebrating the winter solstice in the Andes
3. the lantern festivals in East Asia tied to the first full moon of the lunar year
4. the Navajo sand paintings created during solar eclipses

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a harvest festival celebrating the autumn equinox
6. a lighthouse guiding ships at night
7. a sundial used to tell time
8. a rainbow flag symbolizing diversity
9. a bonfire lit during a full moon
10. a meteor shower observed for scientific study
11. a calendar marking the phases of the moon
12. a solar panel harnessing sunlight for energy
13. a star map used for navigation
14. a fireworks display on New Year's Eve
15. a compass pointing to the North Star
16. a telescope used to observe distant galaxies
17. a candlelit vigil for a community event
18. a weather vane indicating wind direction
19. a solar eclipse viewed through protective glasses
20. a constellation tattoo representing a zodiac sign
21. a sunrise yoga session
22. a moonstone jewelry piece believed to bring luck
23. a solar-powered calculator
24. a star-shaped decoration for a holiday

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
