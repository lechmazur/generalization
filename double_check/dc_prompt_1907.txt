Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Documents that establish sovereignty and are signed by multiple parties

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Treaty of Paris (1783)
2. Treaty of Versailles (1919)
3. United Nations Charter
4. NATO North Atlantic Treaty

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Declaration of Independence
6. Magna Carta
7. Bill of Rights
8. Royal Charter
9. Executive Order
10. Corporate Merger Agreement
11. Marriage License
12. Property Deed
13. Last Will and Testament
14. Birth Certificate
15. Military Commission
16. Letters Patent
17. Papal Bull
18. Trade License
19. Building Permit
20. Driver's License
21. University Diploma
22. Passport
23. Business License
24. Court Order

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
