Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures that rely on tension or equilibrium between opposing forces to maintain functionality or stability.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A suspension bridge
2. A seesaw
3. A bow and arrow
4. A crane

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bicycle
6. A skyscraper
7. A car engine
8. A computer network
9. A solar panel
10. A wind turbine
11. A clock
12. A guitar
13. A parachute
14. A magnet
15. A spring
16. A lever
17. A pulley
18. A wheel and axle
19. A screw
20. A wedge
21. An inclined plane
22. A hydraulic system
23. A gearbox
24. A dam

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
