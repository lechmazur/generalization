Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): abandoned amusement park attractions that were once powered by electricity

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Rotor ride at an old fairground
2. A defunct electric bumper car
3. An abandoned Ferris wheel
4. A derelict haunted house ride

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A wooden roller coaster
6. A carousel with wooden horses
7. A water slide
8. A miniature golf course
9. A funhouse with mirrors
10. A swing ride
11. A go-kart track
12. A petting zoo
13. A playground slide
14. A climbing wall
15. A bungee jumping platform
16. A zip line
17. A paddle boat ride
18. A horse-drawn carriage ride
19. A maze made of hedges
20. A picnic area
21. A botanical garden
22. A sandcastle building area
23. A puppet show stage
24. A face painting booth

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
