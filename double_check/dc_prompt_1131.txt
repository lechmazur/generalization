Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or systems that incorporate modular, interchangeable components designed for adaptability in dynamic environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lego building sets
2. 3D printer filament systems
3. Modular synthesizer components
4. Interchangeable camera lens systems

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Standardized shipping containers
6. Prefabricated home construction kits
7. Automobile assembly lines
8. Computer motherboards
9. Smartphone operating systems
10. Modular furniture
11. Plug-and-play computer peripherals
12. Interlocking paving stones
13. Modular kitchen units
14. Standardized electrical outlets
15. Modular shelving systems
16. Interchangeable watch bands
17. Modular data center components
18. Standardized plumbing fittings
19. Modular office partitions
20. Interchangeable bicycle parts
21. Modular power tool systems
22. Standardized toy train tracks
23. Modular garden irrigation systems
24. Interchangeable guitar strings

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
