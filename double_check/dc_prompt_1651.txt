Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures built primarily to demonstrate mastery over water flow and fountains before 1800

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Villa d'Este in Tivoli, Italy
2. Gardens of Versailles, France
3. Alhambra in Granada, Spain
4. Villa Lante in Bagnaia, Italy

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Colosseum in Rome, Italy
6. Great Wall of China
7. Stonehenge in England
8. Pyramids of Giza, Egypt
9. Parthenon in Athens, Greece
10. Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, France
11. Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey
12. Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy
13. Chichen Itza in Mexico
14. St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, Russia
15. Angkor Wat in Cambodia
16. Petra in Jordan
17. Mont-Saint-Michel in France
18. Forbidden City in Beijing, China
19. Acropolis of Athens, Greece
20. Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany
21. Palace of Westminster in London, England
22. Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany
23. Moai statues on Easter Island
24. Temple of Heaven in Beijing, China

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
