Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): songs that became iconic due to their use in countdown or launch sequences in films or television

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. "Danger Zone" by Kenny Loggins from Top Gun
2. "Life on Mars?" by David Bowie from The Martian
3. "Rocket Man" by Elton John from Rocketman
4. "Space Oddity" by David Bowie from Guardians of the Galaxy

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. "Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor from Rocky III
6. "Born to be Wild" by Steppenwolf from Easy Rider
7. "Stayin' Alive" by Bee Gees from Saturday Night Fever
8. "Lose Yourself" by Eminem from 8 Mile
9. "Don't You (Forget About Me)" by Simple Minds from The Breakfast Club
10. "Chariots of Fire" by Vangelis from Chariots of Fire
11. "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis and the News from Back to the Future
12. "My Heart Will Go On" by Celine Dion from Titanic
13. "Take My Breath Away" by Berlin from Top Gun
14. "Footloose" by Kenny Loggins from Footloose
15. "Ghostbusters" by Ray Parker Jr. from Ghostbusters
16. "We Will Rock You" by Queen from Highlander
17. "Old Time Rock and Roll" by Bob Seger from Risky Business
18. "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston from The Bodyguard
19. "Mrs. Robinson" by Simon & Garfunkel from The Graduate
20. "Singin' in the Rain" by Gene Kelly from Singin' in the Rain
21. "Jailhouse Rock" by Elvis Presley from Jailhouse Rock
22. "The Heat Is On" by Glenn Frey from Beverly Hills Cop
23. "Against All Odds" by Phil Collins from Against All Odds
24. "Time of My Life" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes from Dirty Dancing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
