Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine precision engineering with artistic or aesthetic expression, resulting in functional items that are also celebrated for their beauty or craftsmanship.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A high-end chef's knife with a Damascus steel blade and a hand-carved handle
2. A bespoke bicycle with intricately machined components and a custom paint job
3. A handcrafted wooden clock with precisely engineered gears and a sculpted casing
4. A fountain pen with a gold nib and an elaborately engraved body made of precious resin

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A mass-produced plastic toy
6. A simple wooden chair
7. A concrete building
8. A plain cotton t-shirt
9. A standard ballpoint pen
10. A factory-made ceramic mug
11. A generic stainless steel spoon
12. A basic metal toolbox
13. An off-the-shelf computer keyboard
14. A disposable plastic water bottle
15. A roll of duct tape
16. A pack of printer paper
17. A standard light bulb
18. A brick
19. A length of rope
20. A garden hose
21. A pair of scissors
22. A simple hand saw
23. A box of nails
24. A bag of potting soil

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
