Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or artifacts that feature intentionally obscured or ambiguous imagery, often used for symbolic, artistic, or functional purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Rorschach inkblot test card
2. A camouflage military uniform
3. An abstract expressionist painting
4. A steganographic message hidden in an image

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A blurry photograph
6. A damaged ancient artifact
7. A faded street sign
8. A worn-out coin
9. A scratched DVD
10. A partially erased chalkboard
11. A foggy mirror
12. A dusty window
13. A water-damaged photograph
14. A cracked smartphone screen
15. A weathered gravestone
16. A smudged fingerprint
17. A poorly developed film negative
18. A dirty car windshield
19. A torn magazine page
20. A pixelated digital image
21. A sun-bleached poster
22. A moldy painting
23. A broken television screen
24. A vandalized billboard

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
