Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient structures or artifacts that have withstood natural corrosion or decay due to unique material composition or environmental conditions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Lycurgus Cup (Roman glass, 4th century AD)
2. The Iron Pillar of Delhi (India, 4th century AD)
3. The Moai of Easter Island (Chile, 1250-1500 AD)
4. The Hypogeum of Ä¦al-Saflieni (Malta, 3600-2500 BC)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Pyramid of Giza
6. The Colosseum
7. The Parthenon
8. Stonehenge
9. Machu Picchu
10. Angkor Wat
11. The Terracotta Army
12. The Taj Mahal
13. The Forbidden City
14. Petra
15. Chichen Itza
16. The Hagia Sophia
17. The Leaning Tower of Pisa
18. The Eiffel Tower
19. The Statue of Liberty
20. Mount Rushmore
21. The Golden Gate Bridge
22. The Sydney Opera House
23. The Burj Khalifa
24. The International Space Station

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
