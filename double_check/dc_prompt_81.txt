Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or phenomena that involve the interaction between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds in a way that challenges traditional perceptions of reality.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. quantum entanglement
2. the double-slit experiment
3. Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment
4. the observer effect in quantum mechanics

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. black holes
6. the theory of relativity
7. dark matter
8. the Big Bang
9. string theory
10. the multiverse hypothesis
11. the Higgs boson
12. gravitational waves
13. the uncertainty principle
14. the photoelectric effect
15. the butterfly effect
16. chaos theory
17. the Doppler effect
18. the concept of entropy
19. the holographic principle
20. the Fermi paradox
21. the anthropic principle
22. the concept of time dilation
23. the concept of wormholes
24. the concept of parallel universes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
