Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Gemstones whose names are derived from words in languages no longer spoken natively in the region where they were originally discovered.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. amethyst
2. sapphire
3. emerald
4. topaz

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. diamond
6. ruby
7. pearl
8. opal
9. jade
10. quartz
11. garnet
12. turquoise
13. lapis lazuli
14. peridot
15. zircon
16. agate
17. onyx
18. citrine
19. moonstone
20. spinel
21. tanzanite
22. aquamarine
23. malachite
24. hematite

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
