Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that significantly altered the way people participate in democratic processes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The advent of radio broadcasting, enabling politicians to directly address a mass audience and bypass traditional media gatekeepers.
2. Online petition platforms, facilitating citizen-led initiatives and enabling widespread public engagement in political discourse.
3. Electronic voting machines, automating the voting process and potentially increasing accessibility and speed of vote tabulation.
4. Social media platforms, providing avenues for political campaigns to connect with voters, disseminate information, and mobilize support.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the printing press.
6. The development of the telephone.
7. The creation of the internet.
8. The rise of cable television.
9. The development of smartphones.
10. The use of data analytics in political campaigns.
11. The emergence of artificial intelligence.
12. The development of blockchain technology.
13. The use of facial recognition technology.
14. The rise of online education platforms.
15. The development of e-commerce.
16. The growth of online gaming.
17. The use of virtual reality.
18. The development of augmented reality.
19. The rise of social media influencers.
20. The use of drones.
21. The development of self-driving cars.
22. The rise of the gig economy.
23. The development of 3D printing.
24. The use of CRISPR technology.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
