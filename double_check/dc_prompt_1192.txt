Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that are inherently fragile or unstable but have historically caused significant, widespread disruption or transformation when they fail or collapse.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The stock market
2. A dam
3. A political regime
4. An economic bubble

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A sturdy bridge
6. A well-built skyscraper
7. A stable government
8. A reliable car
9. A strong tree
10. A solid rock formation
11. A permanent magnet
12. A consistent climate
13. A durable appliance
14. A healthy ecosystem
15. A robust economy
16. A fortified castle
17. A well-maintained road
18. A secure vault
19. A long-lasting battery
20. A resilient species
21. A dependable clock
22. A strong foundation
23. A reliable power grid
24. A consistent internet connection

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
