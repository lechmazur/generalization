Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things exhibiting a crystalline structure with a cubic unit cell and exhibiting piezoelectric properties.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sphalerite (ZnS)
2. Sodium chlorate (NaClO3)
3. Gallium arsenide (GaAs)
4. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) in its perovskite phase

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Quartz (SiO2)
6. Tourmaline
7. Rochelle salt
8. Berlinite (AlPO4)
9. Sugar
10. Salt (NaCl)
11. Diamond
12. Graphite
13. Gold
14. Iron
15. Copper
16. Aluminum
17. Polyethylene
18. Polypropylene
19. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
20. Teflon
21. Zinc oxide (ZnO) in its wurtzite phase
22. Lithium niobate (LiNbO3)
23. Langasite (La3Ga5SiO14)
24. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
