Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Plants that trap and digest insects using sticky secretions from specialized glandular leaves

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sundew
2. Butterwort
3. Dewy pine
4. Rainbow plant

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Venus flytrap
6. Pitcher plant
7. Bladderwort
8. Cobra lily
9. Sticky weed
10. Flypaper
11. Spider web
12. Sticky trap
13. Insectivorous plant
14. Carnivorous plant
15. Sticky rice
16. Adhesive tape
17. Glue
18. Honey
19. Sap
20. Resin
21. Tar
22. Gum
23. Sticky notes
24. Velcro

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
