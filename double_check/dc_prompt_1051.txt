Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): philosophical concepts or theories that challenge the notion of objective reality by emphasizing the role of human perception, social constructs, or subjective experience in shaping understanding

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
2. Social constructionism
3. Phenomenalism
4. Radical skepticism

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Logical positivism
6. Empiricism
7. Scientific realism
8. The allegory of the cave
9. Cognitive biases
10. Optical illusions
11. Confirmation bias
12. Cultural relativism
13. Moral relativism
14. Postmodernism
15. Existentialism
16. Idealism
17. Solipsism
18. Intersubjectivity
19. Pragmatism
20. Hermeneutics
21. The Matrix (film)
22. Quantum mechanics
23. Neuroplasticity
24. Hallucinations

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
