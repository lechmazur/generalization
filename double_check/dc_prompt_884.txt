Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations named after marine mammals that are known for specific seasonal activities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Seal Beach, California - winter surfing
2. Beluga Point, Alaska - spring whale watching
3. Walrus Island, Alaska - summer breeding grounds
4. Dolphin Bay, Florida - fall migration viewing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Shark Bay, Australia
6. Penguin Island, Western Australia
7. Turtle Beach, Hawaii
8. Whale Rock, Rhode Island
9. Sea Lion Caves, Oregon
10. Manatee Springs, Florida
11. Otter Creek, Vermont
12. Pelican Bay, California
13. Salmon River, Idaho
14. Dolphin Coast, South Africa
15. Seal Harbor, Maine
16. Whale Beach, Australia
17. Porpoise Point, Florida
18. Narwhal Bay, Canada
19. Dugong Bay, Australia
20. Seal Rock, Oregon
21. Walrus Cove, Greenland
22. Orca Island, Alaska
23. Beluga Lake, Alaska
24. Sea Lion Point, California

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
