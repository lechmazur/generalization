Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): entities or phenomena that embody a sense of melancholy or impermanence while simultaneously evoking wonder or curiosity through their form or behavior

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cherry blossoms in full bloom
2. An abandoned, rusting shipwreck
3. A comet passing through the night sky
4. An ancient, crumbling castle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bustling city street
6. A thriving coral reef
7. A newly constructed skyscraper
8. A vibrant carnival parade
9. A busy shopping mall
10. A well-maintained garden
11. A modern art museum
12. A crowded beach on a sunny day
13. A high-tech amusement park
14. A successful business meeting
15. A bustling farmer's market
16. A thriving forest ecosystem
17. A newly opened restaurant
18. A popular music festival
19. A well-preserved historical monument
20. A lively sports event
21. A flourishing vineyard
22. A state-of-the-art research facility
23. A crowded concert hall
24. A successful product launch

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
