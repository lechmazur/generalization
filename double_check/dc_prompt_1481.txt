Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic works that prominently feature a spiral staircase as both a physical setting and metaphorical device for psychological descent

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The film "Vertigo" by Alfred Hitchcock
2. The novel "House of Leaves" by Mark Z. Danielewski
3. The painting "The Spiral Staircase" by M.C. Escher
4. The video game "Silent Hill 2"

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The film "Inception" by Christopher Nolan
6. The novel "The Shining" by Stephen King
7. The painting "The Persistence of Memory" by Salvador Dal√≠
8. The video game "Bioshock Infinite"
9. The film "Pan's Labyrinth" by Guillermo del Toro
10. The novel "1984" by George Orwell
11. The painting "Starry Night" by Vincent van Gogh
12. The video game "The Last of Us"
13. The film "The Matrix" by the Wachowskis
14. The novel "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley
15. The painting "The Scream" by Edvard Munch
16. The video game "Portal"
17. The film "Blade Runner" by Ridley Scott
18. The novel "Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury
19. The painting "Guernica" by Pablo Picasso
20. The video game "Dark Souls"
21. The film "The Sixth Sense" by M. Night Shyamalan
22. The novel "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger
23. The painting "The Birth of Venus" by Sandro Botticelli
24. The video game "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
