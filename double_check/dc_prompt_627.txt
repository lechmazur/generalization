Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to mitigate unwanted sensory input, specifically sound, light, or smell, using natural materials predominantly sourced within a 100-mile radius of their place of use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a beeswax candle infused with lavender, used to mask unwanted odors
2. a woven hemp curtain treated with natural dyes to block sunlight
3. a corkboard panel designed to absorb sound in a home office
4. a woolen pillow filled with dried herbs to reduce noise and provide a calming scent

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a noise-canceling headphone made from synthetic materials
6. a blackout curtain made from polyester
7. a scented air freshener plug-in
8. a foam earplug
9. a glass window with UV coating
10. a plastic soundproofing panel
11. a synthetic rubber mat to reduce vibration noise
12. a metal wind chime
13. a ceramic diffuser with essential oils
14. a vinyl record player
15. a bamboo windbreak
16. a cotton face mask
17. a silicone baking mat
18. a stainless steel water bottle
19. a leather-bound journal
20. a plastic plant pot
21. a synthetic fiber rug
22. a glass jar with a metal lid
23. a wooden cutting board
24. a paper notebook

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
