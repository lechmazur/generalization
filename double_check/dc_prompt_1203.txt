Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): biological entities or cultural concepts that undergo a dramatic transformation or loss of a defining feature after achieving a specific purpose or milestone

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A caterpillar turning into a butterfly after forming a chrysalis
2. A tadpole losing its tail after metamorphosing into a frog
3. A seed losing its protective coat after germinating into a plant
4. A salmon dying after spawning

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A tree losing its leaves in autumn
6. A snake shedding its skin
7. A star collapsing into a black hole
8. A company undergoing a rebranding
9. A person retiring after a long career
10. A building being demolished after its use is over
11. A car being scrapped after reaching the end of its life
12. A book going out of print after its popularity wanes
13. A festival ending after its scheduled duration
14. A glacier melting due to climate change
15. A smartphone becoming obsolete after new models are released
16. A tradition fading away as society changes
17. A species going extinct due to environmental changes
18. A volcano becoming dormant after an eruption
19. A political regime collapsing after a revolution
20. A fashion trend disappearing after its peak popularity
21. A bridge being closed for safety reasons after years of use
22. A language evolving and losing certain words over time
23. A river changing its course after a natural disaster
24. A piece of technology being upgraded and losing its original features

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
