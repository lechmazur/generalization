Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools or implements that use long wooden handles to manipulate hot items at a safe distance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. fireplace poker
2. marshmallow roasting stick
3. pizza peel
4. chimney sweep brush

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. garden rake
6. shovel
7. baseball bat
8. hockey stick
9. golf club
10. fishing rod
11. paint roller
12. axe
13. broom
14. mop
15. ladle
16. spatula
17. tongs
18. hammer
19. crowbar
20. walking stick
21. umbrella
22. flagpole
23. curtain rod
24. pool cue

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
