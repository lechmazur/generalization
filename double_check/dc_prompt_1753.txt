Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Photosynthetic organisms used in scientific research for studying genetic modification and environmental impact.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Synechocystis
2. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
3. Arabidopsis thaliana
4. Cyanidioschyzon merolae

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Escherichia coli
6. Drosophila melanogaster
7. Saccharomyces cerevisiae
8. Caenorhabditis elegans
9. Mus musculus
10. Danio rerio
11. Zea mays
12. Oryza sativa
13. Solanum lycopersicum
14. Penicillium chrysogenum
15. Streptomyces griseus
16. Dunaliella salina
17. Phaeodactylum tricornutum
18. Spirulina platensis
19. Chlorella vulgaris
20. Tobacco mosaic virus
21. Bacteriophage T4
22. Plasmid DNA
23. CRISPR-Cas9 system
24. Agrobacterium tumefaciens

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
