Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Creative works that explore the ethical implications of technological advancements that mimic or surpass human capabilities.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ex Machina
2. Black Mirror: "White Christmas"
3. Ghost in the Shell
4. Westworld

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Star Wars
6. The Matrix
7. Jurassic Park
8. Blade Runner
9. 2001: A Space Odyssey
10. Minority Report
11. Her
12. Ready Player One
13. Terminator
14. Altered Carbon
15. Gattaca
16. Neuromancer
17. Snow Crash
18. Frankenstein
19. The Stepford Wives
20. Metropolis
21. AI: Artificial Intelligence
22. Robocop
23. Transcendence
24. Upgrade

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
