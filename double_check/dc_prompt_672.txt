Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural formations that are named after human emotions or states of mind

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Despair
2. Mount Hope
3. Mount Joy
4. Mount Misery

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mount Everest
6. Grand Canyon
7. Niagara Falls
8. Mount Kilimanjaro
9. Death Valley
10. Angel Falls
11. Rocky Mountains
12. Great Barrier Reef
13. Mount Fuji
14. Victoria Falls
15. Yellowstone National Park
16. Mount Olympus
17. Serengeti Plains
18. Mount Rushmore
19. Amazon Rainforest
20. Mount Vesuvius
21. Yosemite Valley
22. Mount Etna
23. Galapagos Islands
24. Mount St. Helens

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
