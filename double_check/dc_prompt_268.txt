Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Art installations that incorporate live animals and soundscapes to evoke emotional responses

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A room filled with hundreds of fluttering butterflies and ambient forest sounds
2. An aquarium tunnel with bioluminescent jellyfish and whale song recordings
3. A walk-through aviary with tropical birds and rainforest acoustics
4. A meadow-like space with grazing sheep and wind chimes activated by their movement

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of horses in a field
6. A sculpture made from bird feathers
7. A video projection of swimming fish
8. Wind chimes hanging in a garden
9. A taxidermy display of exotic animals
10. Nature sounds playing through speakers
11. A mechanical butterfly mobile
12. Photos of wildlife in their natural habitat
13. An electronic bird call device
14. A zen garden with recorded meditation sounds
15. Animal footprints cast in bronze
16. A digital aquarium screen
17. Wind-activated musical sculptures
18. A collection of animal-inspired musical instruments
19. Ceramic sculptures of birds
20. A water fountain with nature recordings
21. Animal shadows projected on walls
22. A kinetic sculpture of flying birds
23. An interactive digital pet display
24. A room with animal-themed wallpaper and sounds

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
