Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that fundamentally altered the way time is measured or perceived in competitive environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The introduction of electronic timing systems in swimming races
2. The use of photo finish technology in track and field events
3. The implementation of Hawk-Eye technology for ball tracking in tennis
4. The adoption of chip timing in marathon running

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The development of high-definition television for sports broadcasting
6. The use of drones for capturing aerial footage in sports events
7. The introduction of instant replay in football games
8. The implementation of wearable fitness trackers for athletes
9. The use of virtual reality for training in various sports
10. The development of advanced materials for sports equipment
11. The introduction of LED lighting in sports stadiums
12. The use of data analytics for player performance in basketball
13. The implementation of GPS tracking in cycling races
14. The development of smart fabrics for athletic wear
15. The use of 3D printing for custom sports equipment
16. The introduction of robotic referees in soccer
17. The use of biometric sensors for monitoring athlete health
18. The implementation of augmented reality for fan engagement in sports
19. The development of energy-efficient sports facilities
20. The use of artificial intelligence for scouting talent in baseball
21. The introduction of underwater cameras for swimming competitions
22. The use of holography for displaying sports statistics
23. The implementation of blockchain for ticket sales in sports events
24. The development of noise-cancelling technology for sports arenas

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
