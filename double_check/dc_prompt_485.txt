Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative objects that incorporate electroluminescent wire (EL wire) as a primary design element and were commercially available before 2005.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Luminator EL Wire Picture Frame
2. LyTec Glowing Vase
3. ElectroFlex Decorative Room Divider
4. LightWire Holiday Wreath

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. LED string lights
6. Neon wall sign
7. Fiber optic lamp
8. Modern EL wire sculpture
9. Plasma ball
10. Lava lamp
11. Black light poster
12. Glowstick decoration
13. LED picture frame
14. Rope light border
15. Light-up glass blocks
16. Illuminated water fountain
17. EL wire costume
18. Fluorescent wall art
19. LED canvas painting
20. Holographic display
21. Light-up crystal ball
22. Illuminated wind chimes
23. Color-changing cube
24. Digital photo frame

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
