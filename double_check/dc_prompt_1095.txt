Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies or systems designed to mitigate human-induced environmental crises through innovative, often speculative, or experimental methods.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Artificial trees designed to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide
2. Ocean fertilization techniques to enhance phytoplankton growth for carbon sequestration
3. Geoengineering projects that aim to reflect sunlight to reduce global warming
4. Biodegradable drones used for reforestation in deforested areas

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Solar panels for residential energy
6. Electric vehicles
7. Recycling programs
8. Wind turbines
9. Hydroelectric dams
10. LED lighting
11. Composting systems
12. Public transportation systems
13. Organic farming practices
14. Energy-efficient appliances
15. Smart thermostats
16. Rainwater harvesting systems
17. Vertical farming
18. Green roofs
19. Biodegradable packaging
20. Water purification systems
21. Hybrid cars
22. Insulation materials for buildings
23. Low-flow water fixtures
24. Urban bike-sharing programs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
