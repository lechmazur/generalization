Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices designed to measure and record specific environmental factors at regular intervals for a pre-determined duration, using internal mechanisms and requiring no external power source during operation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A device that logs temperature and humidity levels every hour for 30 days, powered by an internal battery.
2. An apparatus that records air pressure changes every 15 minutes for a week, using a self-contained power source.
3. A tool that measures and stores UV radiation intensity every 30 minutes for 2 months, operating on an internal energy cell.
4. An instrument that captures soil moisture data every 10 minutes for 45 days, utilizing an integrated power mechanism.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weather station that requires external power to operate and transmit data in real-time.
6. A sensor that measures air quality but needs to be connected to a power outlet.
7. A device that records noise levels but only operates when manually activated.
8. A gadget that monitors water pH levels and requires periodic battery replacement.
9. A system that tracks solar radiation but needs to be plugged into an electrical socket.
10. A tool that measures wind speed and direction but must be connected to a computer for data logging.
11. A device that logs seismic activity but requires a connection to a power grid.
12. An instrument that records atmospheric CO2 levels but needs external power to function.
13. A sensor that measures light intensity but only operates when connected to a power source.
14. A device that monitors ocean salinity but requires a wired connection for data collection.
15. A tool that tracks rainfall but needs to be manually powered.
16. An apparatus that measures dew point but requires a solar panel for operation.
17. A system that logs river flow rates but needs to be connected to a generator.
18. A device that records magnetic field strength but requires periodic recharging from an external source.
19. An instrument that measures ozone levels but needs to be plugged into a power outlet.
20. A sensor that tracks particulate matter but requires a connection to a power grid.
21. A tool that monitors groundwater levels but needs to be manually activated.
22. A device that logs barometric pressure but requires a battery that must be replaced frequently.
23. An apparatus that measures soil temperature but needs to be connected to a computer for data logging.
24. A system that tracks humidity but requires a solar panel for operation.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
