Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that utilize rotational motion to create or symbolize a central point of energy or chaos

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. tornado
2. whirlpool
3. black hole
4. hurricane

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. windmill
6. spinning top
7. carousel
8. ferris wheel
9. ceiling fan
10. propeller
11. turbine
12. blender
13. washing machine
14. record player
15. drill
16. potter's wheel
17. gyroscope
18. pinwheel
19. water wheel
20. merry-go-round
21. helicopter rotor
22. clock hands
23. tire
24. food processor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
