Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures designed and built by humans that utilize gravity-assisted water flow for a primary function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Roman aqueduct
2. Water mill
3. Gravity-fed irrigation system
4. Hydroelectric dam

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a windmill
6. a solar panel
7. a steam engine
8. a suspension bridge
9. a lighthouse
10. a skyscraper
11. a submarine
12. a hot air balloon
13. a nuclear reactor
14. a coal mine
15. a telescope
16. a bicycle
17. a helicopter
18. a conveyor belt
19. a printing press
20. a refrigerator
21. a microwave oven
22. a diesel locomotive
23. a space shuttle
24. a wind turbine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
