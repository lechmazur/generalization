Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Household objects that commonly serve as makeshift sleeping surfaces but were not designed for sleeping

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a couch
2. a recliner
3. a bean bag chair
4. a hammock

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bed
6. a sleeping bag
7. a futon
8. a mattress
9. a crib
10. a cot
11. a sleeping pad
12. a bunk bed
13. a daybed
14. a waterbed
15. a murphy bed
16. a trundle bed
17. a canopy bed
18. a four-poster bed
19. a sleigh bed
20. a platform bed
21. a toddler bed
22. a bassinet
23. a chaise lounge
24. a tatami mat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
