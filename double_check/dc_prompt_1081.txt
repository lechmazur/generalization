Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that involve the irreversible transformation or destruction of a central, defining element to achieve a critical purpose or resolution.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a matchstick
2. a self-destructing message
3. a firework
4. a disposable camera

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a lightbulb
6. a car engine
7. a battery
8. a candle
9. a printer
10. a smartphone
11. a clock
12. a refrigerator
13. a washing machine
14. a microwave
15. a bicycle
16. a computer
17. a toaster
18. a blender
19. a vacuum cleaner
20. a television
21. a fan
22. a coffee maker
23. a hairdryer
24. a lawnmower

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
