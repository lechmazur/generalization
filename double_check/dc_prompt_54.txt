Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices that utilize gravity-assisted, controlled release mechanisms for granular or particulate materials.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. hourglass
2. salt shaker
3. pepper grinder
4. gumball machine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. water fountain
6. conveyor belt
7. elevator
8. pulley system
9. grain silo
10. coffee grinder
11. spice rack
12. sugar bowl
13. flour sifter
14. candy dispenser
15. water mill
16. funnel
17. measuring cup
18. storage container
19. blender
20. food processor
21. mortar and pestle
22. spice jar
23. tea infuser
24. coffee filter

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
