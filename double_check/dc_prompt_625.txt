Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Crystalline minerals containing copper that exhibit vivid blue hues.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Azurite
2. Linarite
3. Shattuckite
4. Plancheite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Malachite
6. Chalcopyrite
7. Bornite
8. Chrysocolla
9. Turquoise
10. Copper
11. Quartz
12. Diamond
13. Sapphire
14. Emerald
15. Gold
16. Silver
17. Pyrite
18. Hematite
19. Galena
20. Halite
21. Gypsum
22. Calcite
23. Fluorite
24. Apatite

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
