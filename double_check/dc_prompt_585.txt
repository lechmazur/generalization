Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for traditional Indian performing arts that incorporate metallic elements as integral parts of their construction or sound production.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ghungroo
2. manjira
3. tabla
4. jal tarang

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. bamboo flute
6. wooden harmonium
7. silk sari costume
8. peacock feather crown
9. leather drum
10. wooden puppet
11. clay pot drum
12. coconut shell rattle
13. cotton dance scarf
14. wooden ankle bells
15. glass bangles
16. plastic tambourine
17. stone sculpture props
18. paper masks
19. reed pipes
20. wooden clapper
21. ceramic bells
22. gourd shaker
23. jute rope props
24. bamboo percussion sticks

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
