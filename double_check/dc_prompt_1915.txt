Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): ancient human species identified through fossilized skeletal remains

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Homo neanderthalensis
2. Homo erectus
3. Australopithecus afarensis
4. Homo floresiensis

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Modern human skeletal remains
6. Dinosaur fossils
7. Stone tools
8. Cave paintings
9. Ancient pottery
10. Mitochondrial DNA analysis
11. Neanderthal DNA in modern humans
12. Fossilized plant remains
13. Archaeological sites
14. Ancient burial sites
15. Prehistoric animal bones
16. Human migration patterns
17. Climate data from ice cores
18. Ancient human footprints
19. Artifacts from early civilizations
20. Genetic studies of ancient populations
21. Reconstructed ancient environments
22. Historical texts
23. Early human settlement patterns
24. Tools used for fossil excavation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
