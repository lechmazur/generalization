Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that rely on precise temperature control to function effectively or maintain structural integrity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a laboratory incubator
2. a semiconductor fabrication cleanroom
3. a cryogenic storage tank
4. a chocolate tempering machine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a refrigerator
6. a car engine
7. a solar panel
8. a wind turbine
9. a microwave oven
10. a coffee maker
11. a toaster
12. a space heater
13. a thermostat
14. a thermometer
15. a hot water bottle
16. a fireplace
17. a heat lamp
18. a pressure cooker
19. a steam iron
20. a hair dryer
21. a dehumidifier
22. a fan
23. a humidifier
24. a freezer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
