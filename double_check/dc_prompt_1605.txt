Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that temporarily alter their physical form when activated but return to their original state when deactivated

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A memory foam pillow that contours to the shape of a person's head when they lie on it and returns to its original shape when they get up.
2. A spring-loaded door stopper that compresses when stepped on and springs back to its original shape when released.
3. A gel stress ball that deforms when squeezed and returns to its original shape when released.
4. A retractable pen that extends its tip when clicked and retracts it back when clicked again.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A rubber band that stretches when pulled and stays stretched if not released.
6. A piece of clay that can be molded into different shapes but does not return to its original form.
7. A folding chair that collapses for storage but does not automatically return to its open position.
8. A balloon that expands when filled with air but does not return to its original size when deflated.
9. A metal that changes shape when heated but remains in the new shape when cooled.
10. A toy car that transforms into a robot but does not revert back to a car without manual intervention.
11. A piece of paper that can be crumpled but does not automatically smooth out.
12. A sponge that absorbs water and expands but does not return to its original size when dried.
13. A plastic bottle that can be squeezed but does not return to its original shape.
14. A piece of fabric that wrinkles when crumpled but does not automatically unwrinkle.
15. A glass that shatters when dropped and cannot return to its original form.
16. A wooden plank that bends under weight but does not return to its original shape when the weight is removed.
17. A metal spring that compresses when weight is applied but does not return to its original length if overstretched.
18. A candle that melts when lit but does not return to its original shape when cooled.
19. A piece of ice that melts into water and cannot return to its solid form.
20. A rubber tire that deforms when driven over rough terrain but does not return to its original shape.
21. A plastic toy that bends when heated but stays in the new shape when cooled.
22. A metal wire that can be bent into different shapes but does not return to its original form.
23. A piece of chewing gum that can be stretched but does not return to its original shape.
24. A plastic container that deforms under pressure but does not return to its original shape when the pressure is removed.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
