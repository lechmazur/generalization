Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Industrial control systems themed around mythological battles

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hydra-9000 Distributed Control System
2. Titan Supervisory Control Platform
3. Olympus Process Automation Network
4. Phoenix Industrial Control Interface

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Zeus Electric Generator
6. Poseidon Water Treatment Plant
7. Viking Manufacturing Line
8. Hercules Heavy Machinery
9. Automated Battlefield Simulator
10. Ancient Combat Training System
11. Mythological Reference Database
12. Historical Battle Analyzer
13. Dragon's Lair Security System
14. Warrior Spirit Combat Trainer
15. Epic Tales Archive System
16. Legendary Weapons Database
17. Battle Command Center
18. War Games Simulation Platform
19. Combat Operations Network
20. Military Control Interface
21. Ancient Warfare Simulator
22. Strategic Battle Computer
23. Mythical Creatures Database
24. Heroes of Legend Archive

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
