Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that repurpose industrial or utilitarian materials into designs that evoke a sense of warmth, nostalgia, or emotional comfort.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A lamp made from an old factory pulley
2. A coffee table crafted from reclaimed barn wood
3. A chair upholstered with vintage grain sacks
4. A clock made from a repurposed bicycle wheel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern glass and steel skyscraper
6. A plastic water bottle
7. A digital smartwatch
8. A stainless steel kitchen sink
9. A high-tech gaming console
10. A ceramic vase
11. A leather-bound journal
12. A marble statue
13. A silk scarf
14. A wooden cutting board
15. A cast iron skillet
16. A bamboo toothbrush
17. A woolen blanket
18. A porcelain teapot
19. A fiberglass kayak
20. A titanium bicycle frame
21. A granite countertop
22. A carbon fiber tennis racket
23. A velvet armchair
24. A silver necklace

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
