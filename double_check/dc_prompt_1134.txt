Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): technologies or systems that use real-time data monitoring to predict and prevent failures in physical structures or devices

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A system embedded in a wind turbine analyzes vibration and temperature data to predict bearing wear and schedule maintenance before failure.
2. Sensors on a bridge monitor strain, deflection, and environmental factors to anticipate potential structural weaknesses and trigger alerts for inspection.
3. A smart HVAC system in a data center uses real-time temperature, humidity, and airflow data to predict potential cooling failures and adjust operations to prevent overheating.
4. An industrial robot arm utilizes current and voltage sensors to detect motor anomalies and prevent unplanned downtime due to component failure.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weather forecasting system predicting rainfall based on atmospheric pressure and temperature.
6. A stock market analysis tool predicting price fluctuations based on historical data and trading volume.
7. A medical device monitoring heart rate and blood pressure to alert medical professionals of potential emergencies.
8. A car's tire pressure monitoring system alerting the driver when tire pressure is low.
9. A smart home security system detecting motion and triggering an alarm.
10. A traffic management system adjusting traffic light timings based on real-time traffic flow.
11. A social media platform analyzing user engagement to personalize content recommendations.
12. An online advertising platform predicting click-through rates based on user demographics and browsing history.
13. A fitness tracker monitoring steps, heart rate, and sleep patterns to provide personalized health insights.
14. A GPS navigation system providing real-time traffic updates and route optimization.
15. An email spam filter classifying incoming emails based on content and sender information.
16. A voice assistant responding to user queries based on natural language processing.
17. A music streaming service recommending songs based on listening history and user preferences.
18. A video game adjusting difficulty based on player performance.
19. An e-commerce platform recommending products based on purchase history and browsing behavior.
20. A search engine ranking websites based on relevance and authority.
21. A machine learning model predicting customer churn based on usage patterns and demographics.
22. A fraud detection system identifying suspicious transactions based on spending patterns and location data.
23. A self-driving car navigating using real-time sensor data and mapping information.
24. A power grid managing electricity distribution based on real-time energy demand.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
