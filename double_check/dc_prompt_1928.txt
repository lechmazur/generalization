Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional rituals that are made from natural materials and have a specific color associated with their use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. white sage smudge bundle
2. red ochre powder bowl
3. black obsidian ceremonial knife
4. green jade prayer beads

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. silver chalice
6. brass bell
7. wooden cross
8. glass prayer beads
9. ceramic incense holder
10. metal singing bowl
11. plastic prayer wheel
12. synthetic drum
13. steel ritual sword
14. crystal ball
15. painted wooden mask
16. gold offering plate
17. bronze ritual vessel
18. copper meditation bowl
19. silk prayer flags
20. clay ritual pot
21. stone altar
22. bamboo flute
23. leather drum
24. cotton prayer rug

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
