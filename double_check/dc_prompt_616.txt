Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects constructed primarily of redwood that have been continuously inhabited for at least 75 years.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a redwood cabin in the Sierra Nevada mountains
2. a redwood lighthouse on the California coast
3. a redwood farmhouse in Sonoma County
4. a redwood chapel in a historic village

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a redwood picnic table
6. a redwood gazebo in a park
7. a redwood fence around a garden
8. a redwood deck on a modern house
9. a redwood birdhouse
10. a redwood bridge in a forest
11. a redwood bench in a public square
12. a redwood shed in a backyard
13. a redwood treehouse
14. a redwood barn used for storage
15. a redwood sauna by a lake
16. a redwood outhouse in a campground
17. a redwood playhouse for children
18. a redwood mailbox post
19. a redwood signpost at a trailhead
20. a redwood pergola in a vineyard
21. a redwood hot tub enclosure
22. a redwood storage chest
23. a redwood canoe
24. a redwood sculpture in a park

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
