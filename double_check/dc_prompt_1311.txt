Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that incorporate modular components to enhance adaptability, scalability, or efficiency in their design or function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. LEGO building sets
2. Modular shelving units
3. Modular smartphone designs
4. Prefabricated modular homes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Integrated circuit
6. Monolithic architecture
7. Fixed gear bicycle
8. Traditional wooden furniture
9. Single-piece cast iron skillet
10. Non-modular power supply
11. One-piece swimsuit
12. Hardwired electrical system
13. Non-expandable laptop
14. Single-unit air conditioner
15. Fixed seating in a theater
16. Non-adjustable office chair
17. Single-piece car body
18. Traditional brick-and-mortar construction
19. Non-modular kitchen appliance
20. Fixed blade knife
21. Single-piece sculpture
22. Non-expandable storage container
23. Integrated washing machine
24. Fixed lens camera

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
