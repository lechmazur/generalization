Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials or structures that combine two distinct phases or components to enhance functionality, where one phase is embedded within or bonded to the other in a way that creates a synergistic effect.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a composite material used in aircraft wings, consisting of carbon fibers embedded in a polymer matrix
2. a dental implant made from a titanium core coated with a bioactive ceramic layer to promote bone integration
3. a smart fabric with conductive threads woven into a non-conductive textile for wearable electronics
4. a catalytic converter in vehicles, where a ceramic honeycomb structure is coated with precious metal catalysts

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a layered cake with different flavors
6. a hybrid car combining electric and gasoline engines
7. a dual-layer paint system for corrosion protection
8. a sandwich panel used in construction
9. a multi-component alloy with enhanced strength
10. a laminated glass used in car windshields
11. a reinforced concrete structure
12. a bimetallic strip used in thermostats
13. a composite bow made from different materials
14. a multi-layer PCB (Printed Circuit Board)
15. a dual-phase steel used in automotive applications
16. a fiber-reinforced polymer used in sports equipment
17. a multi-material 3D printed object
18. a coaxial cable with different layers for signal transmission
19. a laminated wood beam for structural support
20. a multi-layer coating on eyeglass lenses
21. a hybrid solar cell combining organic and inorganic materials
22. a multi-component drug delivery system
23. a composite material with interpenetrating networks
24. a multi-layer insulation used in spacecraft

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
