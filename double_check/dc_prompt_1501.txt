Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mass-produced items that are commonly used as placeholders when demonstrating how something works

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. lorem ipsum text
2. a red widget
3. John Smith
4. john.doe@email.com

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a prototype circuit board
6. a test tube
7. a blank canvas
8. a practice target
9. a mannequin
10. a cardboard box
11. a sample bottle
12. a template document
13. a mock-up design
14. a blank form
15. a placeholder image
16. a demo account
17. a training dummy
18. a sample product
19. a prop phone
20. a display model
21. a blank notebook
22. a practice pad
23. a staging environment
24. a beta version

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
