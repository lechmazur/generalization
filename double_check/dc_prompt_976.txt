Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Written works that incorporate visual diagrams to convey complex systems or narratives

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A book on human anatomy that includes detailed diagrams of the circulatory system to explain its function and structure.
2. A novel that uses flowcharts to illustrate the complex relationships and interactions between characters throughout the story.
3. A technical manual on electronics that employs circuit diagrams to explain the workings of various electronic devices.
4. A historical text that uses maps and timelines to visually depict the progression of events during a significant period.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A graphic novel that tells its story primarily through illustrations.
6. A children's book with colorful pictures to engage young readers.
7. A textbook on mathematics that includes equations but no diagrams.
8. A scientific article that discusses theories without visual aids.
9. A cookbook with recipes but no diagrams of cooking techniques.
10. A travel guide that includes photographs of landmarks but no maps.
11. A biography that uses text to narrate a person's life without visual timelines.
12. A manual on car maintenance that uses text descriptions but no diagrams of car parts.
13. A novel that describes settings in detail but does not include any visual aids.
14. A history book that discusses events chronologically without using timelines.
15. A technical report on software development that includes code snippets but no flowcharts.
16. An art book that showcases paintings and sculptures but does not explain them with diagrams.
17. A self-help book that uses text to explain concepts without visual aids.
18. A magazine article on architecture that includes photos but no blueprints.
19. A guide to bird watching that lists species but does not include diagrams of bird anatomy.
20. A business report that uses graphs to show data trends but no diagrams to explain business processes.
21. A legal document that outlines laws and regulations without using flowcharts to explain legal processes.
22. A fitness book that describes exercises in text but does not include diagrams of muscle groups.
23. A gardening book that provides planting instructions but no diagrams of plant structures.
24. A music theory book that explains concepts through text and musical notation but no diagrams of musical scales.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
