Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Organisms or cultural artifacts that have adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments through specialized physiological or structural features.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The barrel cactus, with its ability to store water in its thick stem, allowing it to survive in desert conditions.
2. The fennec fox, with its large ears that help dissipate heat and its thick fur that insulates against cold desert nights.
3. The Australian spinifex grass, with its tightly rolled leaves that minimize water loss in arid environments.
4. The traditional Bedouin tent, designed with materials and shapes that provide ventilation and shade in the desert.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A polar bear, adapted to cold environments with its thick fur and layer of blubber.
6. A submarine, designed to withstand the pressure of deep ocean environments.
7. A skyscraper, engineered to withstand high winds and earthquakes.
8. A rainforest orchid, with adaptations for high humidity and frequent rainfall.
9. A snowshoe hare, with its white winter coat for camouflage in snowy environments.
10. A deep-sea anglerfish, with bioluminescent lure to attract prey in the dark ocean depths.
11. A high-altitude mountaineering tent, designed to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.
12. A mangrove tree, with roots that can filter salt from brackish water.
13. A space suit, designed to protect astronauts from the vacuum and temperature extremes of space.
14. A tropical fish, with bright colors for communication and mating in coral reef environments.
15. A penguin, with its streamlined body for swimming in cold ocean waters.
16. A treehouse, built to provide shelter and a unique living experience in forested areas.
17. A camel, known for its ability to go long periods without water, but not specified as an example here.
18. A hydroelectric dam, engineered to harness the power of flowing water.
19. A snowmobile, designed for transportation over snow and ice.
20. A greenhouse, built to create a controlled environment for plant growth.
21. A deep-sea submersible, designed to explore the ocean floor.
22. A solar panel, engineered to convert sunlight into electricity.
23. A wind turbine, designed to harness wind energy.
24. A raincoat, designed to keep the wearer dry in wet conditions.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
