Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific concepts or theories that were first published in German-language papers between 1925-1935 and later became fundamental to their fields

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
2. Pauli Exclusion Principle
3. Schr√∂dinger's Wave Equation
4. Fermi-Dirac Statistics

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Newton's Laws of Motion
6. Einstein's Theory of Relativity
7. Darwin's Theory of Evolution
8. Maxwell's Equations
9. Planck's Quantum Theory
10. Bohr's Model of the Atom
11. Hubble's Law
12. Archimedes' Principle
13. Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
14. Ohm's Law
15. Avogadro's Law
16. Boyle's Law
17. Faraday's Law of Induction
18. Bernoulli's Principle
19. Gauss's Law
20. Hooke's Law
21. Pascal's Law
22. Fibonacci Sequence
23. Mendel's Laws of Inheritance
24. Copernican Heliocentrism

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
