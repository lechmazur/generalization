Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine contrasting sensory experiences in their design or function, such as auditory and visual elements, to create a unified or paradoxical effect.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a music box with a visual display
2. a lamp that changes color based on sound
3. a fountain that plays music synchronized with water patterns
4. a digital picture frame that plays ambient sounds

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a silent film
6. a scented candle
7. a touchscreen tablet
8. a wind chime
9. a kaleidoscope
10. a virtual reality headset
11. a piano
12. a painting
13. a smartphone
14. a radio
15. a book
16. a television
17. a digital clock
18. a sculpture
19. a video game console
20. a projector
21. a smartwatch
22. a camera
23. a microphone
24. a telescope

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
