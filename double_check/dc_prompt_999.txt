Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geometric shapes that are derived from regular polytopes through a process of truncation or expansion.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. truncated icosahedron
2. cuboctahedron
3. rhombicuboctahedron
4. great rhombicosidodecahedron

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. square
6. pentagon
7. hexagon
8. octagon
9. triangle
10. circle
11. cube
12. sphere
13. cylinder
14. cone
15. tetrahedron
16. dodecahedron
17. icosahedron
18. pyramid
19. prism
20. torus
21. ellipsoid
22. parallelogram
23. rhombus
24. trapezoid

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
