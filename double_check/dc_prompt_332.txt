Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to be held in one hand that contain a hidden compartment revealed by a sliding mechanism.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. vintage brass telescope with secret message compartment
2. decorative walking cane with sliding handle storage
3. lipstick case with hidden mirror drawer
4. fountain pen with concealed compartment in barrel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. jewelry box with hidden drawer
6. wall safe behind painting
7. hollowed-out book
8. false-bottom suitcase
9. pocket knife
10. storage ottoman
11. compact mirror
12. mechanical pencil
13. pill bottle
14. secret compartment ring
15. false-bottom can
16. hidden door bookcase
17. storage bench
18. trick picture frame
19. umbrella
20. flashlight
21. toy water gun
22. retractable badge holder
23. combination lock
24. secret drawer desk

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
