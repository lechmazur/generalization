Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or tools that use compressed gas to propel a human body through a fluid medium

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA)
2. Seabob
3. Diver propulsion vehicle (DPV)
4. Oxygen rebreather

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hot air balloon
6. Sailboat
7. Hang glider
8. Parachute
9. Inflatable life vest
10. Submarine
11. Jet ski
12. Surfboard
13. Inflatable boat
14. Snorkel
15. Oxygen tank (without propulsion system)
16. Fins
17. Kayak
18. Paddleboard
19. Rowboat
20. Swimming pool
21. Wetsuit
22. Goggles
23. Ear plugs
24. Nose clip

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
