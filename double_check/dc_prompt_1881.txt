Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that are intentionally placed between two distinct elements to create a sense of transition or connection.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A diplomatic envoy sent to negotiate peace between warring nations.
2. A hallway connecting two separate rooms in a building.
3. A musical interlude bridging two movements in a symphony.
4. A dissolved cross-fade in a film joining two scenes.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bridge over a river.
6. A telephone wire.
7. A train track.
8. A chain link.
9. A computer network cable.
10. A shared wall between apartments.
11. A common ancestor in a family tree.
12. A hyperlink on a webpage.
13. A handshake between two people.
14. A translator facilitating communication.
15. A messenger delivering a letter.
16. A shared interest between friends.
17. A treaty between countries.
18. A road connecting two cities.
19. A flight of stairs.
20. A pipe carrying water.
21. A blood vessel.
22. A nerve impulse.
23. A postal service.
24. A shipping company.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
