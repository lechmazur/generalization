Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Medical procedures or terms that involve listening or sound detection as a primary method of diagnosis or treatment

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. auscultation
2. phonocardiogram
3. tympanometry
4. otoacoustic emissions test

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. blood pressure reading
6. MRI scan
7. ultrasound imaging
8. speech therapy
9. hearing aid fitting
10. cochlear implant
11. vocal cord examination
12. sound therapy
13. white noise machine
14. audiologist consultation
15. ear irrigation
16. throat culture
17. laryngoscopy
18. tinnitus treatment
19. acoustic neuroma surgery
20. balance testing
21. ear drum repair
22. sound wave therapy
23. voice analysis
24. acoustic trauma treatment

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
