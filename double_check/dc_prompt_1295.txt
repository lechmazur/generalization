Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures or designs that incorporate fractal geometry or self-similar patterns at multiple scales.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A building facade composed of repeating triangular modules, each subdivided into smaller, self-similar triangles.
2. A bridge support structure designed with branching elements that mimic the fractal patterns of a tree.
3. A ventilation system with a network of ducts that follow a space-filling curve, such as a Hilbert curve.
4. A decorative screen featuring a Sierpinski triangle pattern.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A geodesic dome
6. A spiral staircase
7. A parabolic arch
8. A honeycomb pattern
9. A tessellated floor
10. A modular building system
11. A cantilever beam
12. A suspension bridge
13. A vaulted ceiling
14. A stained glass window
15. A brick wall
16. A log cabin
17. A thatched roof
18. A yurt
19. A teepee
20. An igloo
21. A skyscraper
22. A stadium
23. A museum
24. A library

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
