Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Elements discovered in the 20th century that are named after a country or region

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Francium
2. Polonium
3. Germanium
4. Americium

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Oxygen
6. Californium
7. Copper
8. Mercury
9. Iron
10. Scandium
11. Helium
12. Uranium
13. Gold
14. Neon
15. Einsteinium
16. Carbon
17. Plutonium
18. Nobelium
19. Sodium
20. Ruthenium
21. Gallium
22. Iridium
23. Hafnium
24. Radium

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
