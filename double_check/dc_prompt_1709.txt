Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Spaces designed to house collections of objects where the primary viewing area is submerged below ground level or water

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Louvre's Islamic Art Gallery in Paris
2. Kimbell Art Museum's sunken courtyard galleries
3. Georgia Aquarium's Ocean Voyager exhibit
4. The Getty Villa's underground antiquities halls

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The British Museum's main gallery
6. The Smithsonian Air and Space Museum
7. Natural History Museum of London
8. A rooftop sculpture garden
9. An open-air archaeological site
10. A lighthouse museum
11. A traditional art gallery
12. A private collection display room
13. A museum's storage facility
14. A public library's rare book room
15. A castle's armor display
16. A botanical garden greenhouse
17. A university's specimen collection
18. A jewelry store display case
19. A natural history diorama
20. A science center exhibition hall
21. A military museum hangar
22. A contemporary art installation space
23. A historical society's main hall
24. A museum's temporary exhibition space

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
