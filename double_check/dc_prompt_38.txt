Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or structures primarily designed for aerial locomotion that unexpectedly resulted in combustion or fire during their first publicly documented attempt at manned flight.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Hindenburg airship
2. The Montgolfier brothers' hot air balloon
3. The Thomas Selfridge and Orville Wright flight
4. The Great Aerodrome by Samuel Langley

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Wright brothers' first successful flight
6. The Spirit of St. Louis
7. The Apollo 11 lunar module
8. The Space Shuttle Challenger
9. The Boeing 747
10. The Concorde
11. The Redstone rocket
12. The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird
13. The Bell X-1
14. The Vostok 1 spacecraft
15. The Zeppelin LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin
16. The Airbus A380
17. The F-16 Fighting Falcon
18. The B-2 Spirit bomber
19. The Sikorsky R-4 helicopter
20. The Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider
21. The Douglas DC-3
22. The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II
23. The V-22 Osprey
24. The SpaceX Falcon 9

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
