Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that are specifically designed to withstand extreme natural disasters

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. tornado shelter
2. seismic isolation bearing
3. hurricane-rated window
4. tsunami sea wall

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. concrete building
6. steel bridge
7. underground bunker
8. life jacket
9. fire extinguisher
10. emergency radio
11. first aid kit
12. water storage tank
13. sandbag
14. storm drain
15. lightning rod
16. flood barrier
17. emergency generator
18. weather vane
19. safety helmet
20. smoke detector
21. emergency flare
22. survival kit
23. weather station
24. emergency shelter

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
