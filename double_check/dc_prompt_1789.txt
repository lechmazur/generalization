Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Optical instruments used for observing distant objects or phenomena, designed with precision-engineered lenses or mirrors.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a refracting telescope
2. a reflecting telescope
3. a binocular
4. a spotting scope

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a microscope
6. a magnifying glass
7. a camera lens
8. a periscope
9. a kaleidoscope
10. a laser pointer
11. a prism
12. a projector
13. a fiber optic cable
14. a pair of eyeglasses
15. a contact lens
16. a rearview mirror
17. a solar panel
18. a night vision goggles
19. a spectroscope
20. a rangefinder
21. a hologram
22. a telescope mount
23. a telescope eyepiece
24. a telescope tripod

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
