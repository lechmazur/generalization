Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that were the first of their kind to be sent into space by humans

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sputnik 1
2. Luna 2
3. Vostok 1
4. Mariner 2

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hubble Space Telescope
6. Voyager 1
7. International Space Station
8. Curiosity Rover
9. Challenger Space Shuttle
10. Galileo Probe
11. New Horizons
12. SpaceX Dragon
13. James Webb Space Telescope
14. Opportunity Rover
15. Huygens Probe
16. Skylab
17. Columbia Space Shuttle
18. Rosetta Probe
19. Kepler Space Telescope
20. Spirit Rover
21. Juno Spacecraft
22. Atlantis Space Shuttle
23. Perseverance Rover
24. Tiangong Space Station

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
