Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for public use that incorporate sustainable materials and have a minimalist aesthetic.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A bus stop shelter constructed with reclaimed wood and featuring a simple slanted roof.
2. A drinking fountain made from recycled stainless steel with a single, push-button activation.
3. A park bench formed from recycled plastic lumber with a sleek, linear design.
4. A bike rack made of bamboo with a minimalist geometric frame.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A solar-powered phone charging station with ornate decorations.
6. A brightly colored playground made from recycled tires.
7. An intricately carved wooden sculpture in a public park.
8. A public restroom facility built with traditional brick and mortar.
9. A wrought iron gate with elaborate scrollwork.
10. A large, inflatable public art installation.
11. A community garden with a variety of plant species.
12. A cobblestone pathway through a public square.
13. A bronze statue of a historical figure.
14. A public library with a grand, classical facade.
15. A streetlight powered by natural gas.
16. A public swimming pool with a complex filtration system.
17. An ornate drinking fountain with multiple spouts.
18. A bus stop shelter made of brightly colored fiberglass.
19. A park bench made of concrete with decorative carvings.
20. A bike rack made of steel with a complex locking mechanism.
21. A public telephone booth made of glass and aluminum.
22. A mailbox made of cast iron with decorative embellishments.
23. A public trash can made of stainless steel with a sensor-activated lid.
24. A crosswalk signal with flashing LED lights and audible alerts.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
