Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient artifacts or structures that were repurposed as waste disposal sites during the 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A section of Hadrian's Wall used as a household dumping ground in the mid-1900s.
2. An abandoned Roman quarry in England filled with construction debris in the 1970s.
3. A crumbling section of the Great Wall of China used by nearby villagers for trash disposal in the late 1980s.
4. A ruined Mayan temple in Central America used as a dumping ground for refuse by locals in the 1960s.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A medieval castle converted into a museum.
6. An ancient Egyptian tomb raided by grave robbers.
7. A Roman amphitheater used for modern concerts.
8. A prehistoric cave used as a shelter by homeless people.
9. A sunken ship used as an artificial reef.
10. A deserted medieval village.
11. An abandoned factory turned into lofts.
12. A disused railway line converted into a walking trail.
13. A landfill built on a former farmland.
14. A modern building demolished and its debris used as landfill.
15. An old growth forest cleared for logging.
16. A river polluted by industrial waste.
17. A mountaintop removed for coal mining.
18. A wetland drained for agriculture.
19. A historic battlefield turned into a national park.
20. An ancient city buried by a volcanic eruption.
21. A medieval church used as a community center.
22. A colonial fort converted into a prison.
23. A Native American burial ground desecrated by looters.
24. A Victorian mansion converted into a hotel.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
