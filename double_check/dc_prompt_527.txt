Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Polyhedra that can be constructed by truncating all vertices of a regular convex polyhedron such that the new faces created at each vertex are regular polygons with the same edge length as the remaining portions of the original faces.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. truncated tetrahedron
2. truncated cube
3. truncated octahedron
4. truncated icosahedron

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. rhombicuboctahedron
6. snub cube
7. great rhombicosidodecahedron
8. truncated dodecahedron with irregular faces
9. cuboctahedron
10. icosidodecahedron
11. tetrahemihexahedron
12. small stellated dodecahedron
13. great dodecahedron
14. compound of five tetrahedra
15. truncated square pyramid
16. truncated triangular prism
17. truncated hexagonal antiprism
18. gyroelongated square bipyramid
19. augmented truncated cube
20. stellated octahedron
21. truncated dodecahedron with unequal edge lengths
22. great truncated cuboctahedron
23. truncated tetrahedron with irregular hexagons
24. partially truncated icosahedron

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
