Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products designed by Marcel Breuer that incorporate cantilevered elements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Wassily Chair
2. Laccio Tables
3. Cesca Chair
4. B35 Chair

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Barcelona Chair
6. Eames Lounge Chair
7. Tulip Table
8. Noguchi Table
9. Aeron Chair
10. Womb Chair
11. Florence Knoll Sofa
12. Eileen Gray Adjustable Table
13. Le Corbusier Chaise Longue
14. Arco Lamp
15. PH Artichoke Lamp
16. Butterfly Chair
17. Nelson Platform Bench
18. Marshmallow Sofa
19. Sacco Chair
20. Brno Chair
21. Diamond Chair
22. Panton Chair
23. Zig Zag Chair
24. Wassily Table

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
