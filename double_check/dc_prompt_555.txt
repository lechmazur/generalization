Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Festivals that incorporate masks and involve a ritualistic cleansing or purification element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Diablada Festival in Bolivia
2. Phi Ta Khon in Thailand
3. Galungan in Bali
4. Tsam Festival in Mongolia

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Rio Carnival
6. Day of the Dead
7. Venice Carnival
8. Holi Festival
9. Songkran
10. Mardi Gras
11. Chinese New Year
12. Diwali
13. Halloween
14. Krampusnacht
15. Beltane Fire Festival
16. Lantern Festival
17. Fasching
18. Thaipusam
19. Burning Man
20. Lohri
21. Timkat
22. Obon Festival
23. Basant Panchami
24. Nowruz

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
