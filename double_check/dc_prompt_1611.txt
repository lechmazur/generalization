Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ceremonial objects that were traditionally dipped in water before being used to mark or anoint a person of power

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Olive branch
2. Feather
3. Scepter
4. Brush

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Crown
6. Throne
7. Ring
8. Amulet
9. Medallion
10. Banner
11. Shield
12. Helmet
13. Staff
14. Orb
15. Chalice
16. Robe
17. Necklace
18. Bracelet
19. Scroll
20. Flag
21. Goblet
22. Horn
23. Drum
24. Mask

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
