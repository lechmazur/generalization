Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): coastal regions known for extreme tidal ranges

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Bay of Fundy in Canada
2. Mont-Saint-Michel in France
3. Ungava Bay in Canada
4. Turnagain Arm in Alaska, USA

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia
6. The Maldives
7. Santorini in Greece
8. The Amazon River
9. The Dead Sea
10. The Nile River
11. The English Channel
12. The Gulf of Mexico
13. The Mediterranean Sea
14. The Pacific Ocean
15. The Atlantic Ocean
16. The Indian Ocean
17. The Red Sea
18. The Caribbean Sea
19. The North Sea
20. The Baltic Sea
21. The Black Sea
22. The Sea of Japan
23. The South China Sea
24. The Bering Sea

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
