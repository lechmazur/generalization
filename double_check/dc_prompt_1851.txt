Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional ceremonies that are colored using natural pigments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Hopi kachina doll painted with mineral pigments
2. A Navajo wedding basket dyed with plant extracts
3. A  Yoruba mask colored with indigo and camwood
4. An Aboriginal didgeridoo decorated with ochre

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A plastic Easter egg
6. A hand-knitted scarf
7. A stainless steel chalice
8. A commercially produced dream catcher
9. A glass Christmas ornament
10. A porcelain teacup
11. A wooden rocking chair
12. A metal wind chime
13. A synthetic wig
14. A store-bought birthday cake
15. A printed greeting card
16. A mass-produced ceramic figurine
17. A plastic toy soldier
18. A rubber duck
19. A silk tapestry
20. A gold ring
21. A leather belt
22. A cotton t-shirt
23. A wool blanket
24. A diamond necklace

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
