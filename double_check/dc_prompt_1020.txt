Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological systems or devices developed in response to major natural disasters or crises, which have since been adapted for broader medical or scientific applications.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Portable ultrasound devices originally designed for disaster zone triage, now common in routine medical diagnostics
2. Water purification tablets developed for tsunami relief efforts, now used in laboratory sterilization
3. Solar-powered blood centrifuges created for earthquake response, now utilized in remote clinics
4. Thermal imaging cameras first deployed for finding survivors in rubble, now used in medical screening

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Penicillin
6. GPS navigation systems
7. Internet communication protocols
8. Weather satellites
9. Emergency alert systems
10. Defibrillators
11. X-ray machines
12. Smoke detectors
13. Water filtration systems
14. Seismographs
15. Hurricane tracking systems
16. Fire retardant materials
17. Emergency radio beacons
18. Radiation detectors
19. Mobile field hospitals
20. Rescue robots
21. Tsunami warning buoys
22. Earthquake resistant buildings
23. Flood control systems
24. Emergency oxygen masks

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
