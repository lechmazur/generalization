Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Household items that were historically dyed or stained black specifically to make them appear more expensive or formal than they actually were

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Victorian-era pine dining chairs
2. 1800s farmhouse mantel clocks
3. Regency-period picture frames
4. Georgian-era wooden bed frames

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. ebony piano keys
6. cast iron cookware
7. obsidian vases
8. onyx coffee tables
9. black marble countertops
10. jet jewelry boxes
11. black lacquered Chinese cabinets
12. wrought iron chandeliers
13. black leather sofas
14. slate fireplace surrounds
15. black walnut bureaus
16. black granite sculptures
17. black velvet curtains
18. black ceramic vases
19. black-painted metal beds
20. black glass mirrors
21. black bamboo screens
22. black porcelain dinnerware
23. black-stained wicker baskets
24. black marble bookends

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
