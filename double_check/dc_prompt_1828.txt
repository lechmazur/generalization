Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made of glass that are used to display or contain other items

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Terrarium
2. Curio cabinet
3. Bell jar
4. Shadow box

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mason jar
6. Fish tank
7. Drinking glass
8. Window pane
9. Mirror
10. Light bulb
11. Glass beads
12. Paperweight
13. Glass eye
14. Test tube
15. Beaker
16. Microscope slide
17. Telescope lens
18. Glass bottle
19. Stained glass window
20. Glass sculpture
21. Christmas ornament
22. Glass doorknob
23. Magnifying glass
24. Hourglass

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
