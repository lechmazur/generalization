Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools or instruments designed for processing organic materials that involve a cutting action and utilize a curved blade or edge.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. sickle
2. scythe
3. pruning hook
4. billhook

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. chainsaw
6. axe
7. hedge trimmer
8. lawn mower
9. chisel
10. hammer
11. shovel
12. rake
13. hoe
14. spade
15. trowel
16. pitchfork
17. garden fork
18. leaf blower
19. mulcher
20. wood chipper
21. drill
22. screwdriver
23. pliers
24. wrench

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
