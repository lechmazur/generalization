Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize biomimicry of serpentine locomotion for navigation or manipulation in challenging environments.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A surgical robot with a flexible, snake-like arm that can navigate through narrow cavities in the body.
2. A search and rescue robot designed to move through rubble and debris using a serpentine gait.
3. A pipe inspection robot that uses undulating movements to propel itself through complex piping systems.
4. A robotic gripper inspired by a snake's constriction abilities, capable of grasping and manipulating delicate objects.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A wheeled robot navigating a maze.
6. A drone equipped with a camera for aerial surveillance.
7. A legged robot traversing uneven terrain.
8. A robotic arm used in manufacturing assembly lines.
9. A self-driving car navigating city streets.
10. A robotic vacuum cleaner.
11. A bio-inspired adhesive based on gecko feet.
12. A prosthetic limb designed for amputees.
13. A robotic fish used for underwater exploration.
14. A swarm of robots coordinating their movements.
15. A robotic exoskeleton for enhancing human strength.
16. A soft robot made of flexible materials.
17. A bio-inspired material that mimics the properties of spider silk.
18. A robot designed for space exploration.
19. A surgical robot with multiple arms and tools.
20. A robot designed for bomb disposal.
21. A robot that mimics the flight of birds.
22. A robot that mimics the movement of insects.
23. A robot designed for agricultural tasks.
24. A robot used for deep sea exploration.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
