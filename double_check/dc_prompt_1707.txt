Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures that were deliberately set on fire as part of documented religious ceremonies before 1900 CE

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The burning of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
2. The Zoroastrian fire altars
3. The Viking ship burial pyres
4. The Celtic Beltane bonfires

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Fire of London
6. The burning of the Library of Alexandria
7. The destruction of Pompeii by volcanic eruption
8. The Chicago Fire of 1871
9. The burning of Joan of Arc
10. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius
11. The burning of witches during the Salem witch trials
12. The firebombing of Dresden
13. The burning of the Reichstag
14. The destruction of the Parthenon
15. The burning of the White House in 1814
16. The fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory
17. The burning of the Bastille
18. The eruption of Krakatoa
19. The burning of Atlanta during the Civil War
20. The fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral in 2019
21. The burning of the Spanish Armada
22. The destruction of the Colosseum
23. The burning of the Hindenburg
24. The fire at Windsor Castle in 1992

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
