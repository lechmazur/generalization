Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures designed primarily for human habitation that incorporate a natural water feature as a central design element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A luxury overwater bungalow in the Maldives with a private plunge pool
2. A house built on stilts over a lake in Switzerland, with a glass floor section for viewing the water below
3. A desert home with a central courtyard featuring a shallow reflecting pool and fountain
4. A canal house in Amsterdam with a rear garden terrace overlooking the waterway

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A beach house
6. A swimming pool
7. A boathouse
8. A dam
9. A lighthouse
10. An aquarium
11. A water park
12. A submarine
13. A cruise ship
14. A houseboat
15. A riverside restaurant
16. A hotel with an ocean view
17. A cabin near a lake
18. A yurt
19. A treehouse
20. An igloo
21. A castle with a moat
22. A farm with a pond
23. A public bathhouse
24. A fountain in a city square

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
