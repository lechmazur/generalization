Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional cultural practices that involve heating liquids for social gatherings

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a ceremonial tea kettle
2. a clay pot for brewing traditional herbal drinks
3. a copper samovar
4. a bamboo steamer for preparing medicinal infusions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a ceremonial drum
6. a woven basket
7. a traditional mask
8. a ceremonial robe
9. a wooden ladle
10. a stone mortar and pestle
11. a ceremonial sword
12. a handwoven rug
13. a decorative vase
14. a ceremonial headdress
15. a traditional flute
16. a clay figurine
17. a ceremonial shield
18. a hand-carved statue
19. a ceremonial fan
20. a traditional musical bow
21. a ceremonial staff
22. a hand-painted scroll
23. a ceremonial gong
24. a traditional incense burner

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
