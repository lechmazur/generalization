Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Research organizations founded before 1940 that were initially funded by a single wealthy individual

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Carnegie Institution of Washington
2. Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research
3. W. K. Kellogg Foundation
4. Russell Sage Foundation

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. National Institutes of Health
6. CERN
7. Max Planck Society
8. Howard Hughes Medical Institute
9. Wellcome Trust
10. Ford Foundation
11. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
12. Chan Zuckerberg Initiative
13. RAND Corporation
14. American Enterprise Institute
15. Brookings Institution
16. Heritage Foundation
17. National Science Foundation
18. The Open Philanthropy Project
19. Salk Institute for Biological Studies
20. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
21. Scripps Research
22. Massachusetts Institute of Technology
23. California Institute of Technology
24. Stanford University

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
