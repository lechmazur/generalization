Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or practices that involve predicting a future event based on cyclical natural phenomena and adjusting behavior accordingly.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Planting crops based on the phases of the moon to optimize growth cycles.
2. Adjusting fishing schedules according to tidal patterns to increase catch rates.
3. Timing the harvest of certain fruits based on seasonal temperature cycles to ensure peak ripeness.
4. Planning outdoor events around predictable weather patterns associated with seasonal changes.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Using historical stock market data to predict future trends.
6. Following a daily routine based on personal productivity cycles.
7. Adjusting sleep schedules according to daylight saving time changes.
8. Planning a vacation around school holiday schedules.
9. Using weather forecasts to decide on clothing choices for the day.
10. Adjusting work schedules based on traffic patterns.
11. Planting a garden based on the recommendations of a local gardening club.
12. Choosing a time to exercise based on personal energy levels throughout the day.
13. Deciding when to travel based on airline ticket prices.
14. Planning a wedding around the availability of a specific venue.
15. Adjusting diet based on seasonal availability of certain foods.
16. Using a calendar to remind oneself of important dates and events.
17. Choosing when to go shopping based on store sale cycles.
18. Deciding when to start a new project based on team availability.
19. Adjusting heating and cooling settings based on daily temperature fluctuations.
20. Planning a move based on the rental market trends in a city.
21. Deciding when to plant a garden based on the last expected frost date.
22. Choosing when to take a break based on work stress levels.
23. Adjusting study schedules based on exam dates.
24. Planning a trip based on the best time to view wildlife migrations.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
