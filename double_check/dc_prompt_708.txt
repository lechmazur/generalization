Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical events or locations that became significant due to societal rejection or neglect

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Stonewall Inn in New York City
2. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City
3. The Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama
4. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The signing of the Declaration of Independence
6. The construction of the Great Wall of China
7. The moon landing in 1969
8. The fall of the Berlin Wall
9. The invention of the printing press
10. The Renaissance period in Europe
11. The Industrial Revolution
12. The discovery of penicillin
13. The establishment of the United Nations
14. The French Revolution
15. The American Civil War
16. The Wright brothers' first flight
17. The coronation of Queen Elizabeth II
18. The Battle of Waterloo
19. The sinking of the Titanic
20. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
21. The Boston Tea Party
22. The D-Day invasion during World War II
23. The launch of Sputnik
24. The end of apartheid in South Africa

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
