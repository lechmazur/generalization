Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional transportation methods used by indigenous peoples in extreme cold environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. dog sleds
2. snowshoes
3. toboggans
4. umiaks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. horse-drawn carriages
6. canoes
7. kayaks
8. bicycles
9. skis
10. snowmobiles
11. trains
12. airplanes
13. hot air balloons
14. submarines
15. rickshaws
16. camels
17. elephants
18. ox carts
19. ferries
20. gondolas
21. trams
22. hovercrafts
23. helicopters
24. zeppelins

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
