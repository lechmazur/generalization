Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that were first discovered or observed indirectly through their effects on light or other electromagnetic radiation before being directly detected or understood.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Neptune
2. Helium
3. Pulsars
4. Black Holes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Pluto
6. Uranus
7. Ceres
8. Eris
9. Makemake
10. Haumea
11. Quasars
12. Exoplanets
13. Dark Matter
14. Dark Energy
15. Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
16. Neutrinos
17. Gravitational Waves
18. Supernovae
19. Neutron Stars
20. White Dwarfs
21. Red Giants
22. Brown Dwarfs
23. Proxima Centauri b
24. TRAPPIST-1e

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
