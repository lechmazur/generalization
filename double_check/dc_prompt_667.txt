Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional festivals that prominently feature a specific type of fermented beverage as a central element of celebration

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Oktoberfest in Munich
2. Beaujolais Nouveau Day in Lyon
3. Belgian Beer Weekend in Brussels
4. Sake Matsuri in Niigata

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Chinese New Year
6. Diwali
7. Thanksgiving
8. Christmas Market
9. Carnival in Rio
10. St. Patrick's Day Parade
11. Songkran Water Festival
12. La Tomatina
13. Holi Festival
14. Day of the Dead
15. Mardi Gras
16. Moon Festival
17. Easter Celebration
18. Venice Carnival
19. Running of the Bulls
20. Lantern Festival
21. Cherry Blossom Festival
22. Winter Solstice
23. Harvest Festival
24. New Year's Eve

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
