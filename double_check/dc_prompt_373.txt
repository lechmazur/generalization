Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that are created through a subtractive process using a granular material and requiring specialized tools.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a marble sculpture
2. a sandcastle
3. a carved wooden figurine
4. a glass engraving

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a clay pot
6. a metal sculpture
7. a 3D-printed object
8. a knitted scarf
9. a painted canvas
10. a molded plastic toy
11. a cast bronze statue
12. a woven basket
13. a ceramic vase
14. a forged sword
15. a stitched quilt
16. a blown glass ornament
17. a carved ice sculpture
18. a molded concrete block
19. a laser-cut metal design
20. a pressed flower arrangement
21. a cast iron skillet
22. a hand-sewn doll
23. a molded wax candle
24. a printed photograph

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
