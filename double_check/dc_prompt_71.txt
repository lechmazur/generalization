Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovative techniques in nature that involve group coordination for a common goal

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ant colonies building bridges with their bodies to cross gaps
2. honeybees performing a waggle dance to communicate food locations
3. schools of fish forming synchronized patterns to evade predators
4. flocks of birds flying in V-formations to conserve energy during migration

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a single spider spinning a web
6. a lone wolf hunting prey
7. a tree growing towards sunlight
8. a chameleon changing its color for camouflage
9. a beaver building a dam alone
10. a butterfly migrating solo
11. a plant releasing seeds into the wind
12. a single bird building a nest
13. a snake shedding its skin
14. a solitary octopus using tools
15. a single dolphin using echolocation
16. a cactus storing water in the desert
17. a single firefly emitting light
18. a lone penguin huddling for warmth
19. a single bat using sonar to navigate
20. a plant growing thorns for protection
21. a single crab molting its shell
22. a solitary turtle laying eggs
23. a single frog catching insects with its tongue
24. a lone kangaroo carrying its joey

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
