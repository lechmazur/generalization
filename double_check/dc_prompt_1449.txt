Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Unfinished creative works that were later completed by someone other than the original creator and became widely recognized masterpieces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Unfinished Symphony by Franz Schubert, completed by others after his death
2. The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens, finished by various authors posthumously
3. Mozart's Requiem, completed by Franz Xaver Süssmayr and others
4. Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 10, completed by Deryck Cooke

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci
6. Beethoven's Symphony No. 9
7. Shakespeare's Hamlet
8. Van Gogh's Starry Night
9. J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings
10. Pablo Picasso's Guernica
11. George Orwell's 1984
12. Michelangelo's David
13. Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice
14. F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby
15. Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg Concertos
16. Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express
17. Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers
18. Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
19. Claude Monet's Water Lilies series
20. Herman Melville's Moby-Dick
21. Ludwig van Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata
22. Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven
23. Salvador Dalí's The Persistence of Memory
24. Emily Dickinson's collected poems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
