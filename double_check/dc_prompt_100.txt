Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): architectural or theoretical frameworks that emerged in the mid-20th century as responses to global homogenization, emphasizing local context, complexity, and non-linear systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Metabolism (architecture)
2. Tropical Architecture
3. Critical Regionalism
4. Arcology

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. International Style
6. Modernism (architecture)
7. Deconstructivism
8. Postmodern architecture
9. Brutalism (architecture)
10. Blobitecture
11. Sustainable architecture
12. Vernacular architecture
13. Organic architecture
14. Art Nouveau
15. Arts and Crafts movement
16. Bauhaus
17. parametric design
18. Biomimicry (architecture)
19. High-tech architecture
20. Green building
21. Passive house
22. Feng shui
23. Vaastu Shastra
24. Landscape urbanism

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
