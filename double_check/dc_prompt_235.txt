Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices that incorporate mechanical interposition to measure or dispense precise quantities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Syringe pump
2. Positive displacement pipette
3. Rotary vane pump
4. Turnstile counter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bathroom scale
6. Thermometer
7. Spectrophotometer
8. Pressure gauge
9. Flow meter
10. Light meter
11. Sound level meter
12. pH meter
13. Stopwatch
14. Ruler
15. Caliper
16. Micrometer
17. Protractor
18. Balance scale
19. Graduated cylinder
20. Beaker
21. Erlenmeyer flask
22. Volumetric flask
23. Burette
24. Pipette (air displacement)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
