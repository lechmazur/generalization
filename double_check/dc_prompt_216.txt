Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): industrial equipment used for automated assembly and packaging of consumer goods

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Robotic arm used for assembling electronic devices
2. Automated conveyor system for packaging food products
3. Palletizing robot for stacking consumer goods onto pallets
4. High-speed bottling line for packaging beverages

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Heavy-duty forklift used in warehouse operations
6. 3D printer for prototyping consumer products
7. Industrial mixer for blending chemicals
8. Automated guided vehicle for material transport in factories
9. Lathe machine for metalworking
10. Commercial dishwasher for cleaning restaurant dishes
11. Industrial air compressor for powering pneumatic tools
12. Automated teller machine for banking services
13. Industrial sewing machine for garment manufacturing
14. Commercial coffee maker for cafes
15. Automated car wash system
16. Industrial vacuum cleaner for cleaning large facilities
17. Automated lawn mower for landscaping
18. Industrial water purifier for processing plant use
19. Automated ticket vending machine for public transport
20. Commercial ice cream maker for restaurants
21. Industrial shredder for recycling paper
22. Automated parking system for managing vehicles
23. Industrial furnace for heat treatment of metals
24. Commercial bread slicer for bakeries

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
