Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical artifacts or documents that were created by a single individual and later became foundational to a widely adopted system or field of study.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton
2. The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin
3. The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx
4. The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Declaration of Independence
6. The Magna Carta
7. The Rosetta Stone
8. The Code of Hammurabi
9. The U.S. Constitution
10. The Dead Sea Scrolls
11. The Gutenberg Bible
12. The Bayeux Tapestry
13. The Epic of Gilgamesh
14. The Book of Kells
15. The Sistine Chapel ceiling
16. The Colosseum
17. The Eiffel Tower
18. The Great Wall of China
19. The Taj Mahal
20. The Parthenon
21. The Sphinx
22. The Terracotta Army
23. The Statue of Liberty
24. The Pyramids of Giza

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
