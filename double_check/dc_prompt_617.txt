Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Kinetic sculptures incorporating primary colored, flat metal shapes connected by wire or rod, and balanced using a mobile-like structure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A sculpture featuring red, blue, and yellow triangles suspended by thin wires, balanced to rotate freely in the wind.
2. A mobile with circular and square metal shapes in primary colors, connected by rods and arranged in a cascading pattern.
3. A kinetic artwork with rectangular and oval metal pieces painted in red, yellow, and blue, linked by thin rods and suspended from a central axis.
4. A balanced structure with flat, geometric metal shapes in primary colors, connected by wires and designed to move harmoniously when touched.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A wooden carving of a bird with painted feathers.
6. A ceramic vase with intricate floral patterns.
7. A marble statue of a human figure.
8. A glass chandelier with crystal pendants.
9. A fabric tapestry depicting a landscape.
10. A bronze sculpture of a horse in motion.
11. A stone monument with engraved text.
12. A plastic model of a futuristic city.
13. A clay pot with abstract carvings.
14. A neon light installation spelling out a word.
15. A wooden puzzle with interlocking pieces.
16. A paper origami crane.
17. A metal wind chime with hollow tubes.
18. A painted canvas with geometric shapes.
19. A wireframe model of a human head.
20. A kinetic sculpture made of recycled materials.
21. A glass sculpture with swirling colors.
22. A wooden mobile with natural wood tones.
23. A metal abstract sculpture with no moving parts.
24. A kinetic sculpture with pastel-colored shapes.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
