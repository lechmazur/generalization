Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made primarily of lead alloys used for both functional and decorative purposes from the 16th to 19th centuries.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. pewter tankard from colonial America
2. decorative lead garden statue from Versailles
3. Victorian pewter candlestick holder
4. 18th century pewter serving platter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. bronze Renaissance sculpture
6. silver Georgian tea service
7. cast iron cooking pot
8. brass door knocker
9. copper weathervane
10. tin soldier toy
11. steel sword hilt
12. gold snuff box
13. modern aluminum sculpture
14. zinc roof ornament
15. bronze church bell
16. wrought iron gate
17. sterling silver cutlery
18. brass candlestick
19. copper cooking pan
20. iron fireplace tools
21. nickel-plated picture frame
22. bronze door handle
23. silver jewelry box
24. steel cooking utensils

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
