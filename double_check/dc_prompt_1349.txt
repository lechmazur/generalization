Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or cultural artifacts that involve layered structures or stratified formations, either physically or conceptually, and are influenced by geological or historical processes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Grand Canyon rock formations
2. Ancient Roman archaeological site
3. Tree rings in a sequoia trunk
4. Venetian glass beads

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Russian nesting dolls
6. Stack of pancakes
7. Wedding cake
8. Deck of cards
9. Sandwich
10. Book pages
11. Plywood
12. Lasagna
13. Onion
14. Paint layers
15. Ice cream sundae
16. Filing cabinet
17. Parking garage
18. Bunk bed
19. Apartment building
20. Clothing layers
21. Baklava pastry
22. Computer hard drive
23. Atmosphere layers
24. Ocean depths

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
