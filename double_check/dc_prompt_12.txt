Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): processes or systems in nature that involve the transformation of a single element through multiple distinct stages, each mediated by different organisms or environmental factors

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the nitrogen cycle, where nitrogen is transformed from atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, and back to atmospheric nitrogen through processes like nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification
2. the carbon cycle, where carbon moves through the atmosphere, plants, animals, soil, and oceans via photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and combustion
3. the life cycle of a butterfly, where an egg transforms into a caterpillar, then a pupa, and finally an adult butterfly
4. the water cycle, where water evaporates, condenses into clouds, precipitates as rain or snow, and flows through rivers and groundwater before evaporating again

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a food chain in an ecosystem
6. the process of photosynthesis in plants
7. the formation of sedimentary rock
8. the life cycle of a frog
9. the decomposition of organic matter by bacteria
10. the process of pollination by bees
11. the formation of fossil fuels
12. the process of cellular respiration
13. the migration patterns of birds
14. the formation of a rainbow
15. the process of erosion by wind and water
16. the life cycle of a star
17. the process of seed germination
18. the formation of a hurricane
19. the process of digestion in animals
20. the formation of a coral reef
21. the process of weathering of rocks
22. the life cycle of a salmon
23. the process of fermentation by yeast
24. the formation of a glacier

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
