Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Moments in history when a single person's decision to cross a physical boundary triggered widespread social or political transformation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, 1955
2. Tank Man standing before tanks in Tiananmen Square, 1989
3. James Meredith walking onto University of Mississippi campus, 1962
4. Elizabeth Eckford attempting to enter Little Rock Central High, 1957

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington
6. The Boston Tea Party
7. Gandhi's Salt March
8. The Fall of the Berlin Wall
9. Nelson Mandela's release from prison
10. The Storming of the Bastille
11. The Montgomery Bus Boycott
12. Cesar Chavez's farm workers strike
13. The Selma to Montgomery March
14. Susan B. Anthony voting illegally
15. The Stonewall Riots
16. The signing of the Declaration of Independence
17. Women's Suffrage Parade of 1913
18. The first sit-in at Woolworth's lunch counter
19. Malcolm X's speech at the Oxford Union
20. The Prague Spring
21. The Iranian Revolution
22. The French Revolution
23. The American Revolution
24. The Russian Revolution

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
