Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to enhance human physical capabilities through wearable technology

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Exoskeleton suit
2. Smart running shoes
3. Augmented reality glasses
4. Wearable robotic arm

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphone
6. Electric bicycle
7. Fitness tracker
8. Virtual reality headset
9. Smartwatch
10. Drone
11. Bluetooth headphones
12. Smart home assistant
13. Electric scooter
14. Tablet
15. Smart thermostat
16. Wireless charging pad
17. 3D printer
18. Smart refrigerator
19. Electric car
20. Smart light bulb
21. Portable speaker
22. Smart TV
23. Home security camera
24. Digital camera

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
