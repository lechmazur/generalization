Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative fabric elements specifically incorporated into academic regalia to signify an earned degree or honor.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. velvet tam
2. honor cord
3. doctoral hood
4. stole of gratitude

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a graduation cap
6. a diploma
7. a class ring
8. a tassel
9. a graduation gown
10. a mortarboard
11. a commencement program
12. a graduation announcement
13. a yearbook
14. a graduation invitation
15. a graduation speech
16. a graduation ceremony ticket
17. a graduation photo
18. a graduation cake
19. a graduation party
20. a class schedule
21. a student ID card
22. a library card
23. a parking permit
24. a transcript

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
