Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices that automatically adjust environmental conditions based on learned user preferences

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A smart thermostat that learns and adjusts the home temperature based on the occupants' daily routines and preferences.
2. An intelligent lighting system that adapts the light intensity and color temperature according to the user's mood and time of day.
3. A smart window shade that automatically adjusts its position based on the user's preferred light levels and privacy needs throughout the day.
4. An adaptive sound system that modifies the audio settings and volume based on the user's listening habits and the ambient noise in the environment.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A manual thermostat that requires users to set the temperature themselves.
6. A standard light switch that does not adjust lighting based on user preferences.
7. A weather station that collects data but does not adjust environmental conditions.
8. A programmable coffee maker that brews at set times but does not learn from user behavior.
9. A remote-controlled ceiling fan that users must adjust manually.
10. A basic air conditioner with fixed settings that users must change manually.
11. A humidity sensor that monitors but does not control the environment.
12. A traditional alarm clock that does not adapt to user sleep patterns.
13. A manual window blind that users must adjust themselves.
14. A non-smart speaker that does not adjust sound based on user preferences.
15. A simple heater with a dial that users must set manually.
16. A regular fan that does not learn or adjust based on user behavior.
17. A standard air purifier with fixed settings that users must change manually.
18. A basic sprinkler system that operates on a timer but does not learn from user behavior.
19. A traditional humidifier that users must adjust manually.
20. A non-smart dehumidifier with fixed settings that users must change manually.
21. A regular smoke detector that does not adjust based on user preferences.
22. A manual irrigation system that users must set and adjust themselves.
23. A standard security camera that does not adapt to user behavior.
24. A basic motion sensor that activates lights but does not learn from user preferences.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
