Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Accessories or clothing items that have been historically used to conceal weapons or surveillance equipment by intelligence agencies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a shoe with a hidden compartment
2. a belt buckle with a concealed blade
3. a hat with a hidden camera
4. a coat with a secret pocket for documents

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a scarf
6. a wristwatch
7. a pair of sunglasses
8. a leather jacket
9. a pair of gloves
10. a necklace
11. a pair of earrings
12. a baseball cap
13. a backpack
14. a wallet
15. a tie
16. a ring
17. a pair of boots
18. a belt
19. a trench coat
20. a handbag
21. a pair of socks
22. a t-shirt
23. a pair of jeans
24. a hoodie

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
