Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic works inspired by literary stream of consciousness techniques.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. James Joyce's "Ulysses" inspired painting series by an artist capturing the internal monologue of characters.
2. A film montage using rapid cuts and voice-overs to mimic the stream of consciousness narrative style from Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway."
3. A dance performance choreographed to reflect the disjointed thoughts and emotions from William Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury."
4. A series of abstract sculptures inspired by the inner thoughts and reflections in Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time."

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting depicting a scene from a classic novel.
6. A film adaptation of a famous book.
7. A sculpture inspired by a historical event.
8. A dance performance based on a traditional folk tale.
9. A photograph series capturing urban landscapes.
10. A musical composition inspired by nature.
11. A theatrical production of a Shakespearean play.
12. A graphic novel adaptation of a popular story.
13. A series of portraits of famous authors.
14. An installation art piece about environmental issues.
15. A documentary film about a historical figure.
16. A ballet performance inspired by a fairy tale.
17. A mural depicting a community's history.
18. A series of photographs inspired by a travelogue.
19. A musical inspired by a real-life event.
20. A painting series inspired by mythological stories.
21. A film about the life of a famous artist.
22. A dance piece reflecting cultural traditions.
23. A sculpture garden inspired by geometric shapes.
24. A theatrical production of a contemporary play.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
