Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional tools used by indigenous peoples for food preparation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Metate and mano (grinding stone)
2. Coolam (clay pot)
3. Mortero (mortar and pestle)
4. Digging stick

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Microwave oven
6. Blender
7. Food processor
8. Electric stove
9. Gas grill
10. Refrigerator
11. Knife (modern steel)
12. Fork
13. Spoon
14. Cutting board (plastic)
15. Whisk
16. Spatula (metal)
17. Measuring cups and spoons
18. Mixing bowls (stainless steel)
19. Pressure cooker
20. Air fryer
21. Slow cooker
22. Cast iron skillet
23. Dutch oven
24. Baking sheet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
