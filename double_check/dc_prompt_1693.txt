Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Underwater geological formations that have been used as natural fish aggregation devices by commercial fishing operations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Seamount
2. Underwater ridge
3. Submarine canyon
4. Guyot

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Coral reef
6. Artificial reef
7. Fish farm
8. Floating fish aggregating device (FAD)
9. Estuary
10. Lagoon
11. Salt marsh
12. Mangrove forest
13. Deep-sea vent
14. Continental shelf
15. Atoll
16. Hydrothermal vent
17. Ocean trench
18. Barrier island
19. Intertidal zone
20. Pelagic zone
21. Marine reserve
22. Underwater volcano
23. Sea grass bed
24. Brackish water lagoon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
