Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to be held in one hand and used to manipulate or interact with hair.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. hairbrush
2. comb
3. hair clip
4. hair straightener

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. shampoo bottle
6. hair dryer
7. curling iron
8. hair gel
9. hair mousse
10. hair spray
11. shower cap
12. towel
13. mirror
14. hair dye
15. scissors
16. razor
17. electric shaver
18. hair band
19. headband
20. hair net
21. barber cape
22. hair extensions
23. wig
24. hair curler

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
