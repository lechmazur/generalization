Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Medical devices that convert one type of sensory input into electrical signals that directly stimulate a different sensory system in the human body

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cochlear implant
2. Visual prosthesis for stimulating the visual cortex
3. Tongue display unit for the visually impaired
4. Vibrotactile sensory substitution device for balance

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hearing aid
6. Pacemaker
7. Insulin pump
8. Artificial heart valve
9. Contact lens
10. Crutch
11. Prosthetic leg
12. Dental implant
13. EEG machine
14. MRI machine
15. X-ray machine
16. Ultrasound machine
17. Blood pressure monitor
18. Thermometer
19. Stethoscope
20. Defibrillator
21. TENS unit
22. Biofeedback device
23. Pulse oximeter
24. Artificial skin

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
