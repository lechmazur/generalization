Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): rivers in Iceland with names ending in "á" that are longer than 20 kilometers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hvítá
2. Jökulsá
3. Ölfusá
4. Þjórsá

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Thames
6. Skaftá
7. Mississippi
8. Nile
9. Rangá
10. Amazon
11. Laxá
12. Danube
13. Seine
14. Volga
15. Grímsá
16. Rhine
17. Yangtze
18. Mekong
19. Tungnaá
20. Colorado
21. Yukon
22. Brúará
23. Niger
24. Murray

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
