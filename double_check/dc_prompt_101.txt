Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine elements of folklore or mythology with a specific geographic location, resulting in a unique cultural artifact or legend.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Jersey Devil of the Pine Barrens
2. The Loch Ness Monster of the Scottish Highlands
3. The Mothman of Point Pleasant
4. The White Lady of Balete Drive

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Zeus
6. The Great Wall of China
7. Unicorns
8. Mount Olympus
9. Dragons
10. The Grand Canyon
11. Leprechauns
12. Stonehenge
13. Mermaids
14. The Amazon Rainforest
15. Thor's Hammer
16. The Pyramids
17. Phoenix
18. Easter Island
19. Centaurs
20. Niagara Falls
21. Pegasus
22. The Eiffel Tower
23. Griffins
24. Mount Everest

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
