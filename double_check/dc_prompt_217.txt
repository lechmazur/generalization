Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Japanese sports cars from the 1990s with distinctive pop-up headlights

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mazda RX-7 FD
2. Toyota Supra MK IV
3. Nissan 300ZX Z32
4. Honda NSX NA1

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ford Mustang GT
6. Chevrolet Corvette C4
7. Porsche 911 Turbo
8. BMW M3 E30
9. Ferrari F40
10. Lamborghini Diablo
11. Dodge Viper RT/10
12. Mazda Miata NA
13. Toyota Celica GT-Four
14. Nissan Skyline R32
15. Subaru Impreza WRX STI
16. Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution III
17. Honda Civic Type R
18. Acura Integra Type R
19. Lexus SC300
20. Volkswagen Golf GTI
21. Audi Quattro
22. Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16
23. Alfa Romeo Spider
24. Lotus Esprit

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
