Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that were originally developed for practical purposes but became primarily associated with traditional festivals or celebrations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a lantern
2. a drum
3. a mask
4. a kite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wedding ring
6. a Christmas tree
7. a menorah
8. a pi√±ata
9. a fireworks display
10. a parade float
11. a birthday cake
12. a Halloween costume
13. a Valentine's Day card
14. a Easter egg
15. a Maypole
16. a jack-o'-lantern
17. a New Year's resolution
18. a Thanksgiving turkey
19. a Mardi Gras bead
20. a Hanukkah dreidel
21. a Diwali lamp
22. a Chinese dragon
23. a carnival mask
24. a harvest wreath

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
