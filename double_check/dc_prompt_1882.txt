Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Optical devices used for surveillance during the Cold War

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Spy satellite camera
2. Periscope
3. Reconnaissance drone camera
4. Binoculars with night vision

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Walkie-talkie
6. Radio transmitter
7. Encrypted typewriter
8. Codebook
9. Submarine sonar
10. Stealth aircraft
11. Listening device
12. Microphone
13. Telegraph machine
14. Radar system
15. Encrypted phone
16. Spy camera pen
17. Satellite dish
18. Laser microphone
19. Wiretap
20. Bug detector
21. Signal jammer
22. Decoding machine
23. Spy plane
24. Encrypted radio

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
