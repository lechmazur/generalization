Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures designed to manage water flow in riparian zones

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Levee along the Mississippi River
2. Canal lock system in the Panama Canal
3. Floodgate in the Netherlands' Delta Works
4. Check dam in a small stream in Arizona

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Irrigation system in a farm field
6. Water treatment plant
7. Reservoir dam
8. Stormwater drain in an urban area
9. Bridge over a river
10. Seawall along a coastline
11. Water fountain in a city park
12. Submarine
13. Swimming pool
14. Boat
15. Water tower
16. Fire hydrant
17. Sprinkler system
18. Water wheel
19. Aqueduct
20. Well
21. Water pump
22. Desalination plant
23. Water turbine
24. Rainwater harvesting system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
