Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or artificial bodies of water that are isolated from larger water systems and have unique ecosystems or properties due to their isolation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Dead Sea
2. Mono Lake
3. Devil's Hole
4. Socotra Island's coastal lagoons

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Amazon River
6. Lake Superior
7. The Pacific Ocean
8. The Nile River
9. The Great Barrier Reef
10. The Mississippi River
11. Lake Baikal
12. The Gulf of Mexico
13. The Yangtze River
14. The Mediterranean Sea
15. The Danube River
16. The Indian Ocean
17. The Colorado River
18. The Atlantic Ocean
19. The Ganges River
20. The Arctic Ocean
21. The Mekong River
22. The Caspian Sea
23. The Rhine River
24. The Southern Ocean

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
