Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures built specifically as customs houses in port cities that were decommissioned between 1985 and 2005 and subsequently converted into art galleries or museums.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Old Customs House in Sydney, Australia
2. The Customs House in Belfast, Northern Ireland
3. The Port of Liverpool Building in Liverpool, England
4. The Old Customs House in Dublin, Ireland

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Louvre Museum in Paris, France
6. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain
7. The Tate Modern in London, England
8. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, USA
9. The British Museum in London, England
10. The National Gallery in Washington, D.C., USA
11. The Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia
12. The Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain
13. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy
14. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Netherlands
15. The Art Institute of Chicago in Chicago, USA
16. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City, USA
17. The Vatican Museums in Vatican City
18. The Acropolis Museum in Athens, Greece
19. The National Museum of China in Beijing, China
20. The Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, France
21. The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., USA
22. The Getty Center in Los Angeles, USA
23. The National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan
24. The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, USA

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
