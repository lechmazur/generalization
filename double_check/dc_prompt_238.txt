Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional lighting methods used by indigenous peoples that utilize animal fats as fuel

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Seal oil lamp
2. Whale blubber candle
3. Yak butter lamp
4. Caribou fat torch

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Electric light bulb
6. Solar-powered lantern
7. Wood-burning torch
8. Gasoline lantern
9. Olive oil lamp
10. Paraffin wax candle
11. LED flashlight
12. Natural gas lamp
13. Coal oil lamp
14. Biogas lamp
15. Propane torch
16. Incandescent bulb
17. Wind-up lantern
18. Solar garden light
19. Battery-powered lamp
20. Alcohol burner
21. Charcoal brazier
22. Neon light
23. Fluorescent tube
24. Bioluminescent algae lamp

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
