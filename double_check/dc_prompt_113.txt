Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artificial systems that replicate natural processes through controlled experimentation and precise manipulation of organic materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Building a synthetic cell with a minimal genome to study fundamental life processes.
2. Creating artificial photosynthesis systems using engineered proteins and light-absorbing materials.
3. Developing a lab-grown organ, such as a liver or kidney, using bioprinting and tissue engineering techniques.
4. Constructing an artificial enzyme with enhanced catalytic properties for specific chemical reactions.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Observing the behavior of ants in a natural ant colony.
6. Studying the growth of plants in a greenhouse.
7. Analyzing the DNA sequence of a wild animal.
8. Developing a computer simulation of weather patterns.
9. Building a robot that mimics the movement of a cheetah.
10. Creating a virtual reality environment of a rainforest.
11. Designing a prosthetic limb that replicates the function of a human arm.
12. Developing a new type of plastic that is biodegradable.
13. Creating a genetically modified crop that is resistant to pests.
14. Using CRISPR technology to edit the genes of a human embryo.
15. Developing a new drug that targets a specific protein in the body.
16. Creating a 3D model of a protein molecule.
17. Studying the effects of pollution on a natural ecosystem.
18. Developing a new type of solar panel that mimics the process of photosynthesis.
19. Creating a self-healing material that mimics the properties of human skin.
20. Building a machine learning algorithm that can identify patterns in biological data.
21. Developing a new type of fertilizer that enhances plant growth.
22. Creating a biofuel from algae.
23. Using bacteria to clean up oil spills.
24. Developing a new type of antibiotic.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
