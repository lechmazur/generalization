Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that represent the intersection of art and science through meticulous craftsmanship and detailed observation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical sketches
2. Faberg√© eggs
3. Astrolabe
4. Botanical illustrations by Maria Sibylla Merian

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a smartphone
6. a digital camera
7. a modern art sculpture
8. a scientific calculator
9. a space shuttle
10. a classical music composition
11. a painting by Jackson Pollock
12. a novel by Isaac Asimov
13. a mathematical theorem
14. a piece of abstract art
15. a computer algorithm
16. a skyscraper
17. a virtual reality headset
18. a symphony orchestra performance
19. a modern dance performance
20. a video game
21. a scientific journal article
22. a fashion runway show
23. a culinary dish
24. a television documentary

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
