Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific discoveries made in secret government facilities that were later revealed to have major civilian applications

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The development of the internet, initially a secret project by the U.S. Department of Defense, which later transformed global communication and commerce.
2. The creation of GPS technology, originally developed by the U.S. military for navigation purposes, now widely used in civilian applications such as navigation systems in cars and smartphones.
3. The invention of the atomic clock, first developed in secret by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards, now essential for global timekeeping and telecommunications.
4. The discovery of synthetic rubber, initially researched in secret by the U.S. government during World War II, which later became crucial for the automotive and manufacturing industries.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The discovery of penicillin, which revolutionized medicine and was developed in a university laboratory.
6. The invention of the steam engine, which transformed industry and transportation, developed by private inventors.
7. The development of the polio vaccine, a major medical breakthrough, researched in academic and private institutions.
8. The creation of the World Wide Web, developed at CERN, a publicly funded European research organization.
9. The discovery of X-rays, which transformed medical diagnostics, made in a university laboratory.
10. The invention of the telephone, which revolutionized communication, developed by private inventors.
11. The development of the airplane, which transformed travel, developed by private inventors.
12. The discovery of DNA's structure, a fundamental breakthrough in biology, made in a university laboratory.
13. The invention of the transistor, which revolutionized electronics, developed in a corporate research lab.
14. The development of the laser, which has numerous applications, researched in academic and private institutions.
15. The discovery of the electron, a fundamental particle, made in a university laboratory.
16. The invention of the electric battery, which transformed energy storage, developed by private inventors.
17. The development of the MRI scanner, which revolutionized medical imaging, researched in academic and private institutions.
18. The discovery of radioactivity, which led to numerous applications, made in a university laboratory.
19. The invention of the printing press, which transformed information dissemination, developed by private inventors.
20. The development of the pacemaker, which revolutionized cardiac care, researched in academic and private institutions.
21. The discovery of the Higgs boson, a fundamental particle, made at a publicly funded research facility.
22. The invention of the refrigerator, which transformed food storage, developed by private inventors.
23. The development of the artificial heart, which revolutionized cardiac care, researched in academic and private institutions.
24. The discovery of the neutron, a fundamental particle, made in a university laboratory.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
