Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Submerged human-made structures intentionally placed in saltwater environments for artistic or ecological purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Underwater sculpture park in Grenada
2. Artificial reef made from sunken ships
3. Submerged art installations in the Maldives
4. Underwater museum in Cancun

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a coral reef
6. a sunken treasure chest
7. a natural underwater cave
8. a shipwreck from a historical battle
9. a submerged ancient city
10. a floating art installation
11. a lighthouse
12. a coastal sculpture garden
13. a marine sanctuary
14. a submerged pipeline
15. a natural rock formation
16. a beachside art exhibit
17. a sunken airplane
18. a tidal pool
19. a submerged archaeological site
20. a floating dock
21. a coastal boardwalk
22. a natural lagoon
23. a submerged buoy
24. a marine research station

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
