Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures that rely on wave propagation to detect, transmit, or mitigate phenomena, where the waves are either mechanical or electromagnetic in nature.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A bat using echolocation to navigate
2. An ultrasound machine used for medical imaging
3. A radio telescope receiving signals from distant galaxies
4. A noise-cancelling headphone using destructive interference

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A dog barking
6. A tuning fork
7. A plucked guitar string
8. A ripple in a pond
9. Heat radiating from a fire
10. Light reflecting off a mirror
11. A prism separating light
12. A magnifying glass focusing light
13. A camera lens
14. Fiber optic cable
15. A lightning strike
16. A transformer
17. An electric motor
18. A pendulum swinging
19. A slinky spring oscillating
20. A seismograph measuring ground motion
21. A thermometer measuring temperature
22. A barometer measuring air pressure
23. A wind turbine generating electricity
24. A water wheel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
