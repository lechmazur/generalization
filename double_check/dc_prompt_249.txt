Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that display intricate patterns altered by environmental exposure over time

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a weathered tree stump with visible growth rings
2. oxidized copper roofing with patina streaks
3. eroded limestone formations in caves
4. rust patterns on abandoned metal structures

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a zebra's stripes
6. a peacock's feathers
7. a Persian carpet design
8. a snowflake
9. a fingerprint
10. a spider web
11. a honeycomb
12. a leopard's spots
13. a butterfly wing
14. a turtle shell
15. a snakeskin
16. a pinecone
17. a seashell
18. a leaf's veins
19. a crystal formation
20. a nautilus shell
21. a sand dune ripple
22. a coral reef
23. a giraffe's coat
24. a mandala design

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
