Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that originated as tools or methods for efficiency but later became symbolic or cultural icons in unrelated contexts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The stopwatch
2. The red carpet
3. The trophy
4. The white flag

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A hammer
6. A wrench
7. A smartphone
8. A laptop
9. A pen
10. A paperclip
11. A stapler
12. A calculator
13. A ruler
14. A compass
15. A microscope
16. A telescope
17. A camera
18. A typewriter
19. A sewing machine
20. A bicycle
21. A car
22. A train
23. A ship
24. An airplane

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
