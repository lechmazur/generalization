Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical training regimens historically documented as used by elite warriors of pre-gunpowder eras.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Roman legionaries' daily marches with full gear
2. Spartan hoplites' endurance drills in the Agoge
3. Mongol horse archers' mounted archery practice
4. Samurai swordsmanship training with bokken

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. modern CrossFit workouts
6. yoga for flexibility
7. marathon running
8. weightlifting for bodybuilding
9. swimming laps in a pool
10. boxing sparring sessions
11. martial arts katas
12. calisthenics routines
13. pilates for core strength
14. cycling on stationary bikes
15. high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
16. rock climbing exercises
17. parkour training
18. kettlebell workouts
19. Zumba dance fitness
20. rowing machine exercises
21. tai chi for relaxation
22. aerobic dance classes
23. functional fitness training
24. pole vaulting practice

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
