Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical events that led to significant changes in building materials or construction techniques in urban areas

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Great Fire of London (1666) leading to the widespread adoption of brick and stone construction over timber.
2. The Industrial Revolution introducing iron and steel frameworks for skyscrapers in the 19th century.
3. The invention of reinforced concrete in the late 19th century revolutionizing urban building design.
4. The post-World War II housing boom popularizing prefabricated construction techniques in urban areas.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the printing press.
6. The development of the steam engine.
7. The discovery of penicillin.
8. The construction of the Eiffel Tower.
9. The introduction of the assembly line by Henry Ford.
10. The invention of the light bulb.
11. The creation of the internet.
12. The Apollo moon landing.
13. The fall of the Berlin Wall.
14. The invention of the telephone.
15. The development of the airplane.
16. The discovery of electricity.
17. The construction of the Panama Canal.
18. The invention of the wheel.
19. The signing of the Magna Carta.
20. The invention of the compass.
21. The discovery of DNA structure.
22. The invention of the camera.
23. The development of the automobile.
24. The invention of the telescope.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
