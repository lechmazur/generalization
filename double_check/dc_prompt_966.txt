Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures who played a pivotal role in unifying fragmented political entities into a single nation-state during the 19th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Otto von Bismarck
2. Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour
3. Giuseppe Garibaldi
4. Klemens von Metternich

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Charlemagne
6. Napoleon Bonaparte
7. George Washington
8. Mahatma Gandhi
9. Nelson Mandela
10. Winston Churchill
11. Julius Caesar
12. Alexander the Great
13. Genghis Khan
14. Simon Bolivar
15. Thomas Jefferson
16. Benjamin Franklin
17. Queen Victoria
18. Elizabeth I
19. Peter the Great
20. Karl Marx
21. Adolf Hitler
22. Joseph Stalin
23. Mao Zedong
24. Ho Chi Minh

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
