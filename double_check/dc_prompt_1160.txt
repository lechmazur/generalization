Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or artifacts that serve both a practical and symbolic function within a specific cultural or ritualistic context.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. prayer beads
2. wedding rings
3. ceremonial drums
4. sacred masks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. decorative vase
6. silver spoon
7. wall clock
8. wooden chair
9. gold necklace
10. ceramic plate
11. bronze statue
12. leather wallet
13. glass bottle
14. metal key
15. paper fan
16. silk scarf
17. stone sculpture
18. copper bell
19. ivory comb
20. bamboo flute
21. crystal pendant
22. brass compass
23. jade bracelet
24. porcelain doll

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
