Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects worn as personal adornments that feature engraved symbols or inscriptions from ancient alphabets

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A bronze Roman ring with Latin text around the band
2. An Egyptian scarab pendant with hieroglyphic inscriptions
3. A Phoenician gold bracelet with carved letters
4. A Sumerian cylinder seal necklace with cuneiform writing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A plain gold wedding band
6. A diamond tennis bracelet
7. A Celtic knot pendant
8. A pearl choker necklace
9. A carved jade bangle
10. A silver charm bracelet
11. A modern engraved locket
12. A beaded anklet
13. A cameo brooch
14. A turquoise statement necklace
15. An ancient pottery fragment with writing
16. A stone tablet with hieroglyphs
17. A decorative hair pin
18. A modern morse code bracelet
19. An art deco watch
20. A tribal bone necklace
21. A Roman coin pendant
22. A medieval crown
23. A crystal pendant
24. An amber talisman

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
