Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or practices that combine minimalism with functionality, often using natural materials and simple designs to achieve their purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a wooden stool with clean lines and no ornamentation
2. a ceramic mug with a simple, ergonomic handle
3. a linen tote bag with a single pocket
4. a bamboo cutting board with a smooth, unadorned surface

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a velvet armchair with intricate embroidery
6. a stainless steel blender with multiple speed settings
7. a crystal chandelier with ornate detailing
8. a leather-bound journal with gold leaf accents
9. a marble countertop with a polished finish
10. a plastic water bottle with a colorful design
11. a synthetic fiber rug with a bold geometric pattern
12. a glass vase with intricate floral engravings
13. a metal sculpture with abstract shapes
14. a polyester jacket with multiple zippers and pockets
15. a porcelain teapot with hand-painted motifs
16. a vinyl record player with a retro design
17. a neon sign with glowing letters
18. a leather sofa with tufted cushions
19. a plastic storage bin with a snap-on lid
20. a silk scarf with a vibrant paisley print
21. a copper kettle with a polished, reflective surface
22. a ceramic figurine with detailed facial features
23. a wooden rocking chair with carved armrests
24. a glass coffee table with a chrome base

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
