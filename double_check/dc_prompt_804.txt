Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical events that significantly altered the political landscape of a region and are named after a specific individual or group.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Norman Conquest
2. The Meiji Restoration
3. The Bolshevik Revolution
4. The Reagan Revolution

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Industrial Revolution
6. The French Revolution
7. The American Civil War
8. The Cold War
9. The Treaty of Versailles
10. The Renaissance
11. The Enlightenment
12. The Great Depression
13. The Cuban Missile Crisis
14. The Berlin Wall
15. The Space Race
16. The Black Death
17. The Protestant Reformation
18. The Manhattan Project
19. The Vietnam War
20. The Gulf War
21. The Arab Spring
22. The Opium Wars
23. The Partition of India
24. The Fall of Constantinople

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
