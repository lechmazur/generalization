Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Computational systems that generate unique outputs by modeling natural phenomena and weather patterns

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A computer program that simulates ocean currents to predict fish migration patterns
2. An AI system that generates art based on fractal patterns found in nature
3. A software that models cloud formation to create realistic weather forecasts
4. A simulation tool that uses wind patterns to optimize the design of wind turbines

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A calculator app for basic arithmetic operations
6. A video game that simulates a fictional universe
7. A text editor for writing and editing documents
8. A music streaming service that recommends songs based on user preferences
9. A virtual reality game set in a fantasy world
10. A language translation app
11. A social media platform for sharing photos and videos
12. A fitness tracker that monitors heart rate and steps
13. A budgeting app for managing personal finances
14. A navigation app that provides driving directions
15. A digital assistant that sets reminders and alarms
16. A photo editing software with filters and effects
17. A recipe app that suggests meals based on ingredients
18. A podcast app that curates episodes based on interests
19. A news aggregator that compiles articles from various sources
20. A stock trading platform for buying and selling shares
21. A meditation app with guided sessions
22. A movie streaming service with personalized recommendations
23. A digital library for borrowing e-books
24. A travel booking site for flights and hotels

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
