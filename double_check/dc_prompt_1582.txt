Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring minerals that were first discovered in the 19th century and are named after living people who were not geologists or mineralogists

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Rosasite
2. Wavellite
3. Smithsonite
4. Witherite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Quartz
6. Diamond
7. Gold
8. Silver
9. Copper
10. Emerald
11. Ruby
12. Sapphire
13. Topaz
14. Amethyst
15. Garnet
16. Opal
17. Tourmaline
18. Beryl
19. Zircon
20. Malachite
21. Azurite
22. Fluorite
23. Pyrite
24. Calcite

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
