Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artifacts or practices involving covert communication or signaling disguised within seemingly innocuous activities or objects.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A quilt pattern used on the Underground Railroad
2. A sailor's love spoon with carved symbols
3. A fan language system in Victorian society
4. A gardener's flower arrangement code

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A secret handshake
6. An invisible ink pen
7. A decoder ring
8. A radio transmitter
9. A smoke signal
10. A treasure map
11. A coded message
12. A signal mirror
13. A carrier pigeon
14. A secret knock
15. A cipher wheel
16. A signal flag
17. A message in a bottle
18. A semaphore system
19. A drum signal
20. A whistled language
21. A microdot
22. A dead drop location
23. A code book
24. A signal lamp

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
