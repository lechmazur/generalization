Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things exhibiting a layered structure where each layer serves a distinct protective or supportive function for the layers beneath it.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a human skull
2. a medieval castle
3. a computer hard drive
4. a bee hive

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a layered cake
6. a sedimentary rock formation
7. a book with multiple chapters
8. a stack of papers
9. a multi-tiered wedding cake
10. a layered hairstyle
11. a lasagna
12. a geological strata
13. a multi-story building
14. a layered fabric
15. a stack of pancakes
16. a multi-level parking garage
17. a layered paint job on a car
18. a multi-tiered fountain
19. a layered salad
20. a stack of CDs
21. a multi-layer circuit board
22. a layered cloud formation
23. a multi-level shopping mall
24. a layered art piece

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
