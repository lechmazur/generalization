Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that emit light as a result of extreme gravitational forces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Accretion disk around a black hole
2. Quasar
3. Blazar
4. Active galactic nucleus

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Light bulb
6. Firefly
7. Sun
8. LED
9. Neon sign
10. Flashlight
11. Lava
12. Lightning
13. Phosphorescence
14. Fluorescent light
15. Incandescent light
16. Star
17. Comet
18. Aurora
19. Fire
20. Laser
21. Chemical reaction
22. Bioluminescence
23. Electroluminescence
24. Radiation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
