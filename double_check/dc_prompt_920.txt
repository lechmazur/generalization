Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or individuals that have experienced significant wear or change over time but continue to serve their original purpose or role.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A pair of well-worn leather boots still used for hiking
2. An old, faded family quilt still used for warmth
3. A vintage car still driven daily
4. A weathered wooden bench still used in a park

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A new pair of sneakers
6. A modern smartphone
7. A freshly painted house
8. A brand new bicycle
9. A restored antique clock
10. A refurbished laptop
11. A newly planted tree
12. A recently published book
13. A newly constructed bridge
14. A freshly baked loaf of bread
15. A newly released movie
16. A brand new set of kitchen knives
17. A newly opened restaurant
18. A freshly cut bouquet of flowers
19. A newly designed website
20. A recently invented gadget
21. A newly released video game
22. A freshly brewed cup of coffee
23. A newly composed song
24. A brand new car

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
