Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Philosophical concepts that have been central to political scandals involving prominent leaders.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Watergate scandal, involving President Nixon, highlighted the concept of utilitarianism, where the perceived greater good (national security) was used to justify illegal actions (political espionage).
2. The Profumo Affair, which shook the British government in the 1960s, involved questions of deception and the social contract, as a minister's lies and risky behavior undermined public trust and the implicit agreement between government and citizens.
3. The Iran-Contra affair during the Reagan administration raised issues of executive power and the limits of presidential authority, sparking debate about the balance of powers and the nature of republicanism.
4. The impeachment trial of President Clinton centered on perjury and obstruction of justice, raising questions about the nature of truth, morality, and the rule of law in a democratic society.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Campaign finance violations
6. Lobbying scandals
7. Insider trading
8. Bribery of public officials
9. Nepotism in government appointments
10. Gerrymandering for political advantage
11. Misuse of government funds for personal gain
12. Plagiarism in political speeches
13. Tax evasion by political figures
14. Conflicts of interest in government contracts
15. Cronyism in awarding government positions
16. Influence peddling by lobbyists
17. Abuse of power by law enforcement agencies
18. Election fraud and voter suppression
19. Foreign interference in elections
20. Spread of misinformation and propaganda
21. Cybersecurity breaches and data leaks
22. Sexual harassment allegations against politicians
23. Cover-ups of environmental disasters
24. Mismanagement of public health crises

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
