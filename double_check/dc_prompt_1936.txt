Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): innovations that were initially developed in secrecy by government agencies during wartime and later had significant civilian applications

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. GPS technology
2. penicillin mass production
3. radar systems
4. the internet (ARPANET)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. steam engine
6. printing press
7. light bulb
8. telephone
9. airplane
10. vaccines
11. nuclear power plants
12. satellite television
13. electric car
14. microwave oven
15. solar panels
16. robotics
17. 3D printing
18. artificial intelligence
19. blockchain technology
20. virtual reality
21. quantum computing
22. autonomous vehicles
23. smartphones
24. renewable energy systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
