Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or locations that evoke a sense of awe and transcendence through their vastness or beauty, often inspiring artistic or philosophical reflection.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Grand Canyon
2. The Northern Lights
3. Mount Everest
4. The Great Barrier Reef

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a city skyline
6. a painting of a sunset
7. a historical monument
8. a bustling market
9. a famous sculpture
10. a concert hall
11. a botanical garden
12. a national museum
13. a famous novel
14. a popular beach resort
15. a renowned university
16. a celebrated film
17. a gourmet restaurant
18. a luxury cruise ship
19. a famous bridge
20. a historic battlefield
21. a renowned opera house
22. a famous sports stadium
23. a celebrated fashion show
24. a popular amusement park

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
