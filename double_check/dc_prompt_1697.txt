Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Competitive sports or dances that originated in coastal fishing villages and maintain active local competitions today

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sailability
2. Coastal Rowing
3. Joutes Nautiques
4. Fish Carrying Race

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Surfing
6. Sailing
7. Kitesurfing
8. Windsurfing
9. Canoe polo
10. Dragon boat racing
11. Outrigger canoe racing
12. Swimming
13. Diving
14. Snorkeling
15. Fishing
16. Beach volleyball
17. Beach soccer
18. Sandcastle building competitions
19. Stone skimming
20. Rowing
21. Kayaking
22. Triathlon
23. Open water swimming
24. Aquathlon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
