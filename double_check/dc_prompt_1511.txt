Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific or technological breakthroughs that were initially dismissed as hoaxes by major newspapers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. When Wilhelm Roentgen discovered X-rays in 1895, many newspapers initially dismissed his findings as a hoax.
2. The Wright brothers' first powered flight in 1903 was initially reported by some newspapers as a hoax.
3. When Barry Marshall and Robin Warren proposed that bacteria caused stomach ulcers in the 1980s, many newspapers dismissed their findings as a hoax.
4. The discovery of the ozone hole over Antarctica in the 1980s was initially dismissed by some newspapers as a hoax.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The initial skepticism about the existence of black holes in the early 20th century.
6. The controversy surrounding the discovery of cold fusion in 1989.
7. The public's initial disbelief in the possibility of human flight before the Wright brothers' success.
8. The skepticism surrounding the first successful heart transplant by Christiaan Barnard in 1967.
9. The initial dismissal of the theory of continental drift proposed by Alfred Wegener in the early 20th century.
10. The controversy over the discovery of the Higgs boson particle in 2012.
11. The initial skepticism about the possibility of cloning mammals before Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996.
12. The public's initial disbelief in the possibility of landing on the moon before the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.
13. The controversy surrounding the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953.
14. The initial skepticism about the possibility of in vitro fertilization before the birth of Louise Brown in 1978.
15. The controversy over the discovery of the exoplanet 51 Pegasi b in 1995.
16. The initial skepticism about the possibility of creating artificial intelligence before the development of Deep Blue in 1997.
17. The public's initial disbelief in the possibility of creating a nuclear chain reaction before the first atomic bomb was detonated in 1945.
18. The controversy surrounding the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964.
19. The initial skepticism about the possibility of creating a vaccine for polio before the Salk vaccine was developed in 1955.
20. The controversy over the discovery of the neutrino particle in 1956.
21. The initial skepticism about the possibility of creating a laser before the first working laser was demonstrated in 1960.
22. The public's initial disbelief in the possibility of creating a computer network before the development of ARPANET in 1969.
23. The controversy surrounding the discovery of the quark particle in 1964.
24. The initial skepticism about the possibility of creating a genetically modified organism before the first GMO was created in 1973.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
