Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or scientific innovations that emerged from the deliberate use of toxic or hazardous materials in their creation or development.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Radium-based luminous paint used in watch dials
2. Mercury used in early thermometers and barometers
3. Lead-based pigments in Renaissance paintings
4. Asbestos used in fireproof theater curtains

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a solar panel
6. a wind turbine
7. a watercolor painting
8. a clay sculpture
9. a wooden violin
10. a glass vase
11. a bronze statue
12. a marble sculpture
13. a digital camera
14. a graphite pencil
15. a ceramic mug
16. a plastic toy
17. a paper origami
18. a cotton canvas
19. a steel bridge
20. a rubber tire
21. a silk scarf
22. a concrete building
23. a wool sweater
24. a bamboo flute

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
