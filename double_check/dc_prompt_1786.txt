Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to suppress or muffle sound through layered materials or structures.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. acoustic foam panels
2. soundproof curtains
3. noise-cancelling headphones
4. automotive sound deadening mats

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a megaphone
6. a loudspeaker
7. a microphone
8. a guitar amplifier
9. a whistle
10. a drum set
11. a piano
12. a radio
13. a television
14. a telephone
15. a walkie-talkie
16. a saxophone
17. a trumpet
18. a violin
19. a flute
20. a clarinet
21. a harmonica
22. a tambourine
23. a cymbal
24. a kazoo

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
