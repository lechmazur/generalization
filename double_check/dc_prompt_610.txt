Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that have been intentionally altered to commemorate a specific, verifiable historical event that occurred before the year 1900.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A musket ball retrieved from the Battle of Gettysburg and engraved with the date and location.
2. A piece of the Berlin Wall with graffiti added after its fall in 1989, commemorating the division of Germany.
3. A dress worn by Queen Victoria modified with black mourning fabric after the death of Prince Albert in 1861.
4. A tree planted in 1876 in a Philadelphia park to commemorate the Centennial Exposition.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A commemorative coin minted in 2000 for the Olympics.
6. A photograph of a historical event.
7. A historical building preserved in its original state.
8. A diary written during a historical event.
9. A piece of pottery from ancient Greece.
10. A naturally formed rock resembling a famous person.
11. A painting depicting a historical event.
12. A replica of a historical artifact.
13. A book about a historical event.
14. A street named after a historical figure.
15. A statue of a historical figure.
16. A historical document.
17. A piece of furniture owned by a historical figure.
18. A building constructed in 1899.
19. A newspaper article reporting on a historical event.
20. A song written about a historical event.
21. A movie about a historical event.
22. A play about a historical event.
23. A poem about a historical event.
24. A commemorative plate from the 1950s.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
