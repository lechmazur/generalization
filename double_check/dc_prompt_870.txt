Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or entities that represent a fundamental shift in understanding or practice within their respective fields, leading to new paradigms or methodologies.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The introduction of quantum mechanics in physics
2. The development of the theory of evolution by natural selection in biology
3. The shift to object-oriented programming in computer science
4. The adoption of the heliocentric model in astronomy

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the printing press
6. The discovery of penicillin
7. The establishment of the internet
8. The creation of the steam engine
9. The formulation of the Pythagorean theorem
10. The development of the microscope
11. The invention of the telephone
12. The discovery of DNA structure
13. The creation of the assembly line
14. The invention of the airplane
15. The development of the polio vaccine
16. The creation of the World Wide Web
17. The invention of the electric light bulb
18. The discovery of the electron
19. The development of the transistor
20. The invention of the compass
21. The discovery of gravity
22. The creation of the first computer
23. The invention of the telescope
24. The development of the theory of relativity

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
