Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Astronomical objects or features that have been named after pioneering women engineers or mathematicians

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. 106 Dione
2. 281 Lucretia
3. 3277 Aaronson
4. 7000 Curie

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mercury
6. Venus
7. Mars
8. Jupiter
9. Saturn
10. Uranus
11. Neptune
12. Pluto
13. Halley's Comet
14. The Sun
15. The Moon
16. Andromeda Galaxy
17. Orion Nebula
18. Black Hole
19. Supernova
20. Asteroid Belt
21. Kuiper Belt
22. Oort Cloud
23. Milky Way
24. Quasar

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
