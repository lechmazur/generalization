Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products discontinued by their manufacturer within one year of their initial release due to unforeseen safety hazards.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Dell Latitude 5285 laptop battery packs
2. Mattel Rock 'n Play Sleeper
3. Samsung Galaxy Note 7
4. Peloton Tread+

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Google Glass
6. Microsoft Zune
7. Coca-Cola New Coke
8. Apple Newton
9. Nokia N-Gage
10. Amazon Fire Phone
11. Sega Dreamcast
12. BlackBerry PlayBook
13. HD DVD players
14. Windows Vista
15. Sony Betamax
16. Facebook Phone
17. Palm Pre
18. Nintendo Virtual Boy
19. Polaroid Polavision
20. DeLorean DMC-12
21. WebTV
22. Philips CD-i
23. Microsoft Kin
24. Ouya Gaming Console

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
