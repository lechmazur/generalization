Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate a flexible, segmented structure primarily for controlled manipulation of another object.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chain whip
2. Bicycle chain
3. Watch band with adjustable links
4. Articulated grabber tool

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Rope
6. Slinky
7. Caterpillar track
8. Zipper
9. Folding chair
10. Umbrella
11. Telescoping ladder
12. Spring
13. Rubber band
14. Hose
15. Knitted scarf
16. Hairbrush
17. Bellows
18. Fan
19. Venetian blinds
20. Comb
21. Chopsticks
22. Tweezers
23. Pliers
24. Scissors

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
