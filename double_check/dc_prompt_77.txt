Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that serve as both a tool for protection and a medium for data storage or transmission

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A medieval knight's shield with a secret compartment for carrying messages.
2. A specially modified walking stick containing a hidden blade and a small, encrypted flash drive.
3. A hollowed-out book containing a pistol and a microfilm of sensitive documents.
4. A smartphone case with a built-in taser and encrypted storage.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A padlock
6. A security camera
7. A firewall
8. A USB drive
9. A hard drive
10. A cloud server
11. A sword
12. A gun
13. Pepper spray
14. A bulletproof vest
15. A safe
16. A vault
17. A diary
18. A letter
19. A photograph
20. A briefcase
21. A backpack
22. A wallet
23. A purse
24. A locked box

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
