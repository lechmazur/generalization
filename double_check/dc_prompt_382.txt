Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects containing a concealed mechanism that activates a surprising or unexpected sensory effect.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A seemingly ordinary book that, when opened, emits a pleasant fragrance.
2. A decorative vase that, when touched, plays a soft melody.
3. A picture frame that, when tilted, projects a hidden image onto the wall.
4. A coffee mug that, when filled with hot liquid, changes its exterior color pattern.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A remote-controlled car
6. A smartphone with touch screen
7. A flashlight that turns on with a button
8. A wind-up toy
9. A musical instrument
10. A door with a lock
11. A television remote
12. A car alarm system
13. A motion sensor light
14. A pressure cooker
15. A blender with multiple speed settings
16. A digital thermometer
17. A smoke detector
18. A vending machine
19. A camera with a flash
20. A laptop with a touchpad
21. A sprinkler system
22. A garage door opener
23. A wristwatch with an alarm
24. A game console controller

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
