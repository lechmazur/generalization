Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or artifacts that were used to preserve or transmit cultural or historical knowledge but are now obsolete or in ruins

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The clay tablets of the ancient Sumerians used for cuneiform writing
2. The birch bark scrolls used by the Ojibwe for recording songs and stories
3. The knotted strings of the Inca quipu used for record keeping
4. The wax tablets used in ancient Rome for writing and education

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern digital encyclopedia
6. A smartphone used for storing family photos
7. A current newspaper
8. A contemporary history textbook
9. A museum exhibit on modern technology
10. A podcast discussing current events
11. A social media platform used for sharing cultural stories
12. A modern library with digital archives
13. A television documentary on recent history
14. A blog about contemporary cultural practices
15. A current art installation exploring modern themes
16. A streaming service offering educational content
17. A virtual reality experience of a modern city
18. A digital music platform preserving contemporary songs
19. A website dedicated to modern folklore
20. An app for learning current languages
21. A modern sculpture representing today's society
22. A video game that teaches about present-day culture
23. A current fashion magazine
24. A live performance of a new play

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
