Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena and man-made structures that involve the movement or storage of liquids in confined spaces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a dam
2. a water tower
3. a submarine ballast tank
4. a hydraulic press

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a river
6. a waterfall
7. a swimming pool
8. a bathtub
9. a rain barrel
10. a water slide
11. a fountain
12. a canal
13. a reservoir
14. a water pump
15. a water filter
16. a water bottle
17. a fish tank
18. a sprinkler system
19. a water wheel
20. a storm drain
21. a water heater
22. a water softener
23. a water meter
24. a water pipe

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
