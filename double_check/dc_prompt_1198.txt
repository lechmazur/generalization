Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine two distinct, seemingly unrelated qualities or functions into a single entity, creating a unique or unexpected duality.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a clock that also functions as a coffee maker
2. a backpack with built-in solar panels to charge devices
3. a lamp that doubles as a plant holder
4. a jacket with integrated heating elements and a music player

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bicycle
6. a blender
7. a camera
8. a refrigerator
9. a pair of scissors
10. a bookshelf
11. a flashlight
12. a toaster
13. a wristwatch
14. a calculator
15. a stapler
16. a watering can
17. a pair of headphones
18. a frying pan
19. a pencil
20. a mirror
21. a suitcase
22. a toothbrush
23. a keychain
24. a candle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
