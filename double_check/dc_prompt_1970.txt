Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems designed to monitor and mitigate environmental hazards in enclosed industrial spaces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A network of air quality sensors linked to an automated ventilation system in a chemical processing plant.
2. A thermal imaging camera system designed to detect overheating equipment and trigger alarms in a data center.
3. A gas detection system with automated shut-off valves for hazardous gas lines in a semiconductor fabrication facility.
4. A real-time radiation monitoring system with personnel dosimeters in a nuclear power plant control room.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weather monitoring station.
6. A fire sprinkler system in an office building.
7. A carbon monoxide detector in a home.
8. A tsunami early warning system.
9. An earthquake early warning system.
10. A security camera system in a retail store.
11. A building management system for climate control.
12. A traffic management system for a city.
13. A flood control system for a river.
14. A water purification system for a municipality.
15. An air traffic control system.
16. A GPS tracking system for vehicles.
17. A patient monitoring system in a hospital.
18. A smoke detector in a hotel room.
19. A burglar alarm system for a house.
20. A radiation monitoring badge worn by a medical technician.
21. A handheld gas detector used by a firefighter.
22. A noise monitoring system near an airport.
23. A water leak detection system in a basement.
24. An automated irrigation system for a farm.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
