Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices that utilize a spring-loaded mechanism to deliver a precise, measured dose of a substance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. insulin pen
2. asthma inhaler
3. epinephrine auto-injector
4. nasal spray pump

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. ballpoint pen
6. mechanical pencil
7. pocket watch
8. jack-in-the-box toy
9. wind-up clock
10. retractable tape measure
11. accordion
12. spring-loaded mousetrap
13. pop-up toaster
14. spring door closer
15. car suspension system
16. spring-loaded stapler
17. spring-loaded clothespin
18. spring-loaded pogo stick
19. spring-loaded toy gun
20. spring-loaded nutcracker
21. spring-loaded gate latch
22. spring-loaded window shade
23. spring-loaded hinge
24. spring-loaded doorstop

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
