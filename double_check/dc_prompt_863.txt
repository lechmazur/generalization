Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Books that were initially rejected by multiple publishers before becoming bestsellers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter
2. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling
3. The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank
4. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald
6. To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
7. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger
8. 1984 by George Orwell
9. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
10. The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
11. War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy
12. The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown
13. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins
14. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson
15. The Fault in Our Stars by John Green
16. Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James
17. The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho
18. Life of Pi by Yann Martel
19. The Road by Cormac McCarthy
20. The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini
21. Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn
22. The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold
23. The Shining by Stephen King
24. Bridget Jones's Diary by Helen Fielding

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
