Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical systems designed to precisely control the position and orientation of a suspended load using cables or ropes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Skycam system used in sports broadcasting
2. Construction crane with a cable-based hoisting mechanism
3. Elevator system using cables for vertical movement
4. Robotic cable-driven parallel manipulator

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a hydraulic lift
6. a drone with propellers
7. a conveyor belt system
8. a robotic arm with joints
9. a pulley system for opening curtains
10. a monorail train
11. a forklift
12. a zip line
13. a funicular railway
14. a hovercraft
15. a wind turbine
16. a roller coaster
17. a ski lift
18. a cable car
19. a drawbridge
20. a pendulum clock
21. a suspension bridge
22. a catapult
23. a parachute
24. a sailboat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
