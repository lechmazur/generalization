Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artificial lakes created in the 20th century that are now major tourist destinations despite being originally built for industrial or agricultural purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lake Mead
2. Lake Powell
3. Lake Nasser
4. Lake Volta

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lake Tahoe
6. Crater Lake
7. Lake Victoria
8. Lake Titicaca
9. Lake Baikal
10. Lake Superior
11. Loch Ness
12. Lake Como
13. Lake Geneva
14. Lake Michigan
15. Lake Ontario
16. Lake Huron
17. Lake Erie
18. Lake Tanganyika
19. Lake Malawi
20. Lake Garda
21. Lake Lucerne
22. Lake Bled
23. Lake Balaton
24. Lake Titicaca

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
