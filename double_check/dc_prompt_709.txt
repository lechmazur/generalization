Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that fundamentally altered human perception of time and space

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The invention of the steam locomotive
2. The development of the telegraph
3. The creation of the airplane
4. The launch of the first satellite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the printing press
6. The discovery of electricity
7. The development of the internet
8. The creation of the smartphone
9. The invention of the automobile
10. The development of nuclear power
11. The creation of the personal computer
12. The invention of the camera
13. The development of GPS technology
14. The creation of social media platforms
15. The invention of the radio
16. The development of the television
17. The creation of virtual reality
18. The invention of the bicycle
19. The development of the steam engine
20. The creation of the elevator
21. The invention of the refrigerator
22. The development of the combustion engine
23. The creation of the microwave oven
24. The invention of the sewing machine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
