Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects traditionally made with iridescent materials that served as symbols of power in pre-modern civilizations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a ceremonial headdress adorned with iridescent feathers
2. a scepter inlaid with opalescent gemstones
3. a shield decorated with mother-of-pearl inlays
4. a crown embedded with shimmering abalone shell fragments

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a golden chalice
6. a marble statue
7. a bronze sword
8. a wooden throne
9. a jade necklace
10. a clay pot
11. a silver coin
12. a stone tablet
13. a leather belt
14. a glass mirror
15. a woven tapestry
16. a ceramic vase
17. a steel helmet
18. a parchment scroll
19. a wooden mask
20. a copper bracelet
21. a bone carving
22. a silk robe
23. a crystal goblet
24. a feather fan

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
