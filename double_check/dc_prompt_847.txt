Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Art installations that require audience participation to complete the experience

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Yayoi Kusama's "Obliteration Room" where visitors place colored dots on white surfaces
2. Marina AbramoviÄ‡'s "The Artist is Present" where visitors sit silently across from the artist
3. Felix Gonzalez-Torres's "Untitled (Portrait of Ross in L.A.)" where visitors take candy from a pile
4. Rirkrit Tiravanija's "Untitled (Free)" where visitors share meals cooked by the artist

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Mona Lisa at the Louvre
6. Michelangelo's David statue
7. A street performer doing magic tricks
8. An interactive museum touch screen
9. A children's playground sculpture
10. A public fountain
11. A gallery audio guide
12. A virtual reality art exhibition
13. A musical concert
14. A theater performance
15. A photography exhibition
16. A sculpture garden
17. A museum docent tour
18. An art demonstration
19. A graffiti wall
20. A light show projection
21. A kinetic sculpture
22. A video art installation
23. A sound art piece
24. A holographic display

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
