Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Underwater training facilities that teach traditional pearl diving techniques while preserving cultural heritage

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ama diver training program in a simulated ocean environment focusing on breath-holding and sustainable harvesting practices.
2. A submerged replica of a historic pearling village used to educate visitors on the cultural significance of pearl diving in the Persian Gulf.
3. An underwater facility in French Polynesia that teaches Polynesian free-diving methods for collecting oysters and maintaining the lagoon ecosystem.
4. A controlled environment replicating the conditions of the Sulu Sea, where trainees learn Badjao diving techniques and traditional boat building.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Scuba diving certification course
6. Underwater welding school
7. Marine biology research laboratory
8. Museum exhibit on pearl diving history
9. Free-diving competition
10. Underwater photography workshop
11. Commercial pearl farm
12. Documentary film about pearl divers
13. Abalone harvesting cooperative
14. Underwater escape training for pilots
15. Synchronized swimming practice
16. Offshore oil rig training simulator
17. Coral reef restoration project
18. Book on the history of jewelry making
19. Underwater archaeology expedition
20. Snorkeling tour of a tropical lagoon
21. Oyster farming workshop
22. Maritime museum showcasing traditional boats
23. Cultural center celebrating coastal traditions
24. Aquarium with a pearl oyster exhibit

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
