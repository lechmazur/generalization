Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or events that occur at the boundary between two distinct environments or states, where the transition is marked by a significant change in conditions or properties.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the shoreline where ocean meets land
2. the event horizon of a black hole
3. the interface between fresh and saltwater in an estuary
4. the melting point of ice

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a mountain peak
6. a river flowing through a valley
7. a forest ecosystem
8. a desert oasis
9. a city skyline
10. a coral reef
11. a volcanic eruption
12. a thunderstorm
13. a rainbow
14. a waterfall
15. a glacier
16. a sand dune
17. a canyon
18. a tidal wave
19. a lightning bolt
20. a geyser
21. a hurricane
22. a tornado
23. a sunrise
24. a sunset

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
