Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient artifacts that were deliberately submerged in water as part of religious or cultural ceremonies before being rediscovered in modern times

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Antikythera Mechanism, found off the coast of Greece, was part of a shipwreck believed to be a ritual offering to the sea gods.
2. The Nemi Ships, discovered in Lake Nemi, Italy, were thought to be offerings to the goddess Diana.
3. The Votive Boat of Fiumicino, found submerged near the ancient port of Claudius, was likely a ceremonial offering to Neptune.
4. The Dover Bronze Age Boat, discovered in the UK, was believed to have been intentionally sunk as part of a ritual.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ancient pottery found in a dry cave in Peru.
6. A Viking sword discovered in a burial mound in Norway.
7. Egyptian artifacts found in the desert sands near the pyramids.
8. A Roman mosaic uncovered in a villa in Pompeii.
9. Prehistoric tools found in a cave in France.
10. A Celtic coin hoard discovered in a field in England.
11. Ancient Chinese bronzes found in a tomb in Xi'an.
12. A Maya stela found in a jungle in Guatemala.
13. Ancient Greek statues found in a temple in Athens.
14. A medieval manuscript discovered in a monastery in Ireland.
15. Ancient jewelry found in a royal tomb in Egypt.
16. A shipwreck from the 18th century found off the coast of Florida.
17. A Neolithic settlement discovered underwater in the Mediterranean.
18. Ancient rock art found in a canyon in Australia.
19. A Byzantine icon found in a church in Constantinople.
20. Ancient Incan artifacts found in a mountain pass in Peru.
21. A Roman amphora found in a shipwreck in the Black Sea.
22. Ancient tools found in a riverbed in Africa.
23. A medieval castle discovered in ruins in Scotland.
24. Ancient pottery found in an archaeological dig in Israel.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
