Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations or individuals whose names or contributions are commonly mispronounced or misunderstood despite their widespread recognition.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Nikola Tesla
2. Marie Curie
3. Wi-Fi
4. Quinoa

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Albert Einstein
6. Isaac Newton
7. Thomas Edison
8. Charles Darwin
9. Galileo Galilei
10. Leonardo da Vinci
11. Internet
12. Smartphone
13. Computer
14. Television
15. Radio
16. Electricity
17. Automobile
18. Airplane
19. Telephone
20. Light bulb
21. Steam engine
22. Printing press
23. Penicillin
24. Vaccination

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
