Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Territorial markers used by both animals and human cultures that rely on scent or chemical signals to communicate boundaries

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. urine sprayed by tigers along forest paths
2. pheromone trails left by ants to mark colony boundaries
3. scent glands used by wolves to mark pack territories
4. musk deer secretions used to mark Asian tribal hunting grounds

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. barbed wire fencing
6. stone wall boundaries
7. painted property lines
8. guard towers
9. warning signs
10. border checkpoints
11. flag markers
12. bird songs
13. visual displays by peacocks
14. graffiti tags
15. hedge rows
16. moats
17. electric fences
18. security cameras
19. motion sensors
20. guard dogs
21. tribal tattoos
22. cairns
23. tree blazes
24. GPS coordinates

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
