Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that incorporate celestial imagery into functional design for navigation or measurement purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. astrolabe
2. nocturnal navigation device
3. sextant
4. star compass

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. constellation tattoo
6. moon phase watch face
7. star-shaped ceiling light
8. sundial garden ornament
9. galaxy print bedding
10. star map poster
11. planetary mobile
12. zodiac jewelry
13. celestial globe decoration
14. star-themed wind chimes
15. moon and stars wallpaper
16. astronomical clock tower
17. star-shaped cookie cutter
18. planet-themed coasters
19. moon phase calendar
20. star chart software
21. constellation projection lamp
22. solar system model
23. star-shaped door knocker
24. moon phase garden stake

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
