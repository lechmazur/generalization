Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Literary works that feature a character named Lollia or a variant spelling (Lolly, Lollie, etc.) as a significant character, not just a passing mention.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner
2. Lollie Bliss and the Pirate Queen by Margaret Stuart Barry
3. Miss Lolly's Secret Garden by Elizabeth Mansfield
4. The Adventures of Lollia Paulina by Sarah May

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov
6. The Dollmaker by Harriette Arnow
7. Little Women by Louisa May Alcott
8. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath
9. The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett
10. Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll
11. Emma by Jane Austen
12. The Color Purple by Alice Walker
13. Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte
14. The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton
15. Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf
16. Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert
17. The Awakening by Kate Chopin
18. Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier
19. The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman
20. Beloved by Toni Morrison
21. The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck
22. The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel Spark
23. The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton
24. The Portrait of a Lady by Henry James

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
