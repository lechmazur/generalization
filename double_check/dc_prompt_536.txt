Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Metal alloys named after people that are primarily used for bearings

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Babbitt metal
2. Frary metal
3. Hoyt metal
4. Rose's metal

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bessemer steel
6. Hadfield steel
7. Reynolds aluminum
8. Monel metal
9. bronze
10. brass
11. pewter
12. sterling silver
13. Wood's metal
14. Nichrome
15. tungsten carbide
16. cast iron
17. stainless steel
18. German silver
19. white gold
20. Duralumin
21. Vitallium
22. Alnico
23. Stellite
24. Hastelloy

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
