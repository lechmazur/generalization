Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Sacred groves that have been continuously maintained by indigenous communities for over 500 years and still serve their original religious function

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove, Nigeria
2. Ficus Sacred Grove, India
3. Kayas of the Mijikenda, Kenya
4. Hawaiian Sacred Groves, Hawaii

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge, England
6. Angkor Wat, Cambodia
7. Mount Olympus, Greece
8. Uluru, Australia
9. Amazon Rainforest, South America
10. Great Barrier Reef, Australia
11. Vatican City, Italy
12. Mecca, Saudi Arabia
13. Jerusalem, Israel
14. Mount Fuji, Japan
15. Chichen Itza, Mexico
16. Petra, Jordan
17. Yellowstone National Park, USA
18. Banff National Park, Canada
19. Gal√°pagos Islands, Ecuador
20. Serengeti National Park, Tanzania
21. Grand Canyon, USA
22. Great Wall of China, China
23. Machu Picchu, Peru
24. Notre-Dame Cathedral, France

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
