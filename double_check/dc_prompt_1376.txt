Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional characters who were once human but had their consciousness transferred into an artificial vessel while retaining their original personality and memories

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a scientist who uploaded their mind into a robotic body to continue their research after a terminal illness
2. a soldier whose consciousness was transferred into a combat drone to continue serving after a fatal injury
3. a musician who preserved their mind in a holographic form to perform eternally after their physical death
4. a detective whose brain was copied into an AI system to solve crimes beyond their natural lifespan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a cyborg with enhanced limbs but a fully organic brain
6. a clone created from the DNA of a deceased individual
7. a robot programmed with the personality traits of a historical figure
8. a virtual assistant modeled after a famous celebrity's voice and mannerisms
9. a human who underwent genetic modification to extend their lifespan
10. a ghost haunting a machine due to unfinished business
11. a human brain preserved in a jar and connected to a computer
12. a hologram of a deceased person created from old recordings
13. a human who uses a neural interface to control a robot remotely
14. a sentient AI that believes it was once human but has no actual memories
15. a human who uploaded their memories to a computer but did not retain consciousness
16. a robot designed to mimic human emotions without a human origin
17. a human who transferred their consciousness into an animal body
18. a digital avatar created to represent a living human in a virtual world
19. a human who uses a brain-computer interface to enhance their cognitive abilities
20. a robot that inherited the memories of its creator after their death
21. a human who became a digital entity but lost their original personality
22. a human who uploaded their consciousness into a virtual reality simulation
23. a robot that gained sentience after being exposed to human emotions
24. a human who transferred their consciousness into a plant-based organism

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
