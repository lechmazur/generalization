Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Celestial structures named after mythological figures or deities that are larger than a galaxy but smaller than a universe.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall
2. Sloan Great Wall
3. Perseus-Pisces Supercluster
4. Shapley Supercluster

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Milky Way
6. Andromeda Galaxy
7. Orion Nebula
8. Virgo Cluster
9. Centaurus A
10. Triangulum Galaxy
11. Messier 87
12. Sombrero Galaxy
13. Large Magellanic Cloud
14. Small Magellanic Cloud
15. Black Eye Galaxy
16. Whirlpool Galaxy
17. Pinwheel Galaxy
18. Cartwheel Galaxy
19. Coma Cluster
20. Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster
21. Virgo Supercluster
22. Local Group
23. Leo I Group
24. Ursa Major Cluster

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
