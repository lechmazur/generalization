Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena that result in the creation of a new, distinct entity from a previously existing structure or organism.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis
2. a volcanic island forming from an underwater eruption
3. a seed germinating into a new plant
4. a star forming from a collapsing nebula

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a river carving a canyon
6. a tree shedding its leaves
7. a glacier melting into water
8. a rock eroding into sand
9. a cloud forming in the sky
10. a rainbow appearing after rain
11. a lightning strike during a storm
12. a snowflake crystallizing in the atmosphere
13. a wave crashing on the shore
14. a geyser erupting
15. a tornado forming from a thunderstorm
16. a solar eclipse occurring
17. a meteor shower in the night sky
18. a coral reef growing over time
19. a stalactite forming in a cave
20. a sand dune shifting in the desert
21. a waterfall cascading down a cliff
22. a fog bank rolling in over a valley
23. a comet passing through the solar system
24. a thunderclap during a storm

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
