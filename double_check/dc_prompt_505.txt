Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Depictions of confections in 20th-century Pop Art that include visible bite marks.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Andy Warhol's "Bite into Candy" featuring a bitten chocolate bar
2. Roy Lichtenstein's "Sweet Bite" showing a bitten lollipop
3. Claes Oldenburg's "Bitten Ice Cream" sculpture of a partially eaten ice cream cone
4. Tom Wesselmann's "Mouthful of Candy" depicting a bitten gummy bear

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Andy Warhol's "Campbell's Soup Cans"
6. Roy Lichtenstein's "Whaam!"
7. Claes Oldenburg's "Giant Three-Way Plug"
8. Tom Wesselmann's "Still Life #35"
9. A photograph of a bitten apple
10. A painting of a whole candy bar
11. A sculpture of a bitten sandwich
12. A drawing of a bitten cookie
13. A 19th-century painting of a dessert
14. A modern art piece featuring a bitten fruit
15. A pop art depiction of a whole lollipop
16. A graphic design of a bitten pizza
17. A photograph of a bitten doughnut
18. A painting of a bitten piece of bread
19. A sculpture of a whole ice cream cone
20. A pop art image of a bitten burger
21. A 21st-century artwork of a bitten cake
22. A drawing of a bitten croissant
23. A pop art piece of a whole chocolate bar
24. A painting of a bitten baguette

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
