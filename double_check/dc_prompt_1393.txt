Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Digital platforms that allow users to collapse and expand nested hierarchical content while maintaining a consistent visual header structure

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A website with collapsible sections for different product categories, where each category header remains visible when expanded or collapsed.
2. An educational platform where course modules can be expanded to show lessons, and each module's title stays constant in appearance.
3. A project management tool that allows users to collapse and expand tasks under different project phases, with phase headers maintaining a uniform look.
4. A documentation site where sections can be toggled to show or hide detailed information, with section titles consistently styled.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A blog with a sidebar that can be hidden or shown.
6. A mobile app with swipeable tabs for different sections.
7. A website with a dropdown menu for navigation.
8. An e-commerce site with filters that can be applied to narrow down product listings.
9. A social media platform where users can pin posts to the top of their profile.
10. A news app that allows users to save articles for later reading.
11. A video streaming service with a search function to find content.
12. A fitness app that tracks and displays user progress over time.
13. A music app with a playlist feature that users can customize.
14. A travel booking site with a calendar to select dates for flights or hotels.
15. An online forum where users can reply to threads and create new ones.
16. A weather app that provides forecasts and alerts for different locations.
17. A productivity app with a timer for managing work sessions.
18. A language learning app with interactive lessons and quizzes.
19. A photo editing app with tools to enhance and manipulate images.
20. A financial app that allows users to track their expenses and budget.
21. A gaming platform where users can join multiplayer sessions.
22. A recipe app that provides step-by-step cooking instructions.
23. A virtual reality app that offers immersive experiences.
24. A podcast app that organizes episodes into seasons and series.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
