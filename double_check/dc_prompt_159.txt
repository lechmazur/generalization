Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Platforms or systems that use automated detection of irregular patterns to prevent misuse while allowing high-volume legitimate activity

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A credit card company's system flags purchases drastically different from a user's typical spending habits and location.
2. A social media platform automatically suspends accounts exhibiting bot-like behavior, such as posting identical content hundreds of times per minute.
3. A stock exchange's algorithm halts trading on a stock experiencing an unusually rapid price surge or decline.
4. An online gaming platform identifies and bans players using unauthorized third-party software to cheat.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A security guard checking IDs at a building entrance.
6. A spam filter in an email inbox.
7. A speed camera issuing tickets for exceeding the speed limit.
8. A fingerprint scanner for building access.
9. A metal detector at an airport.
10. A doctor diagnosing a patient based on symptoms.
11. A teacher grading student essays for plagiarism.
12. A librarian organizing books by genre.
13. A store's inventory management system tracking stock levels.
14. A traffic light controlling the flow of vehicles.
15. A smoke detector triggering an alarm.
16. A spell checker identifying misspelled words.
17. A weather forecast predicting rain.
18. A search engine indexing websites.
19. A GPS device navigating a route.
20. A thermostat regulating room temperature.
21. A washing machine automatically adjusting water levels.
22. A camera with facial recognition software.
23. A website using CAPTCHA to verify human users.
24. A firewall blocking unauthorized network traffic.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
