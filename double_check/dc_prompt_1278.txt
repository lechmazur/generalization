Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Visual representations of data that use geometric shapes to encode quantitative information for comparison or analysis.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A bar chart showing monthly sales figures for a company.
2. A pie chart illustrating the distribution of different age groups in a population.
3. A scatter plot displaying the correlation between two variables, such as height and weight.
4. An area chart visualizing the change in market share of different companies over time.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A photograph of a natural landscape.
6. A hand-drawn sketch of a person.
7. A digital painting of a still life.
8. A 3D model of a building.
9. An infographic explaining the water cycle.
10. A flow chart outlining a process.
11. A network diagram showing relationships between entities.
12. A mind map for brainstorming ideas.
13. A table listing data in rows and columns.
14. A text-based description of statistical findings.
15. A musical score.
16. A map showing geographical locations.
17. A blueprint for a mechanical device.
18. A chemical formula.
19. A mathematical equation.
20. A heat map showing website click activity.
21. A tree diagram illustrating hierarchical relationships.
22. A Venn diagram showing set relationships.
23. A timeline of historical events.
24. A box plot showing the distribution of data.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
