Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring minerals or crystals that display a repeating triangular pattern visible to the naked eye

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Quartz
2. Calcite
3. Fluorite
4. Pyrite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hexagonal snowflake
6. Diamond
7. Graphite
8. Amethyst
9. Obsidian
10. Granite
11. Basalt
12. Sandstone
13. Marble
14. Limestone
15. Schist
16. Gneiss
17. Slate
18. Shale
19. Coal
20. Pumice
21. Halite
22. Gypsum
23. Talc
24. Mica

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
