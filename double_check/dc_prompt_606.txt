Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures built primarily for viewing or experiencing a specific natural geological formation in the United States.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Grand View Point Overlook at Canyonlands National Park
2. Tunnel View in Yosemite National Park
3. Multnomah Falls Lodge and viewing platform
4. Observation Tower at Niagara Falls State Park

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mount Rushmore National Memorial
6. Golden Gate Bridge
7. Empire State Building
8. Gateway Arch National Park
9. Statue of Liberty
10. Hoover Dam
11. Cloud Gate (The Bean)
12. Space Needle
13. Disneyland
14. Yellowstone National Park
15. Grand Canyon National Park
16. Acadia National Park
17. Zion National Park
18. A hiking trail
19. A campsite
20. A visitor center
21. A museum
22. A restaurant with a view
23. A scenic overlook of a city
24. A bridge over a river

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
