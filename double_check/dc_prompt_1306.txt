Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): phenomena or concepts that describe the interaction or influence between two or more entities, where the relationship is governed by a measurable force or principle, and the entities can be separated by a definable distance or boundary.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon
2. Electrostatic force between two charged particles
3. Magnetic interaction between two magnets
4. Pressure difference across a semipermeable membrane

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Symbiotic relationship between two organisms
6. A conversation between two people
7. Economic trade between two countries
8. A bridge connecting two islands
9. A family bond
10. Cause and effect
11. A chemical reaction
12. Heat transfer through conduction
13. Light traveling through a prism
14. A supply chain
15. The internet
16. A neural network
17. A food web
18. A domino effect
19. Cultural diffusion
20. Friendship
21. Competition between businesses
22. A predator-prey relationship
23. The water cycle
24. A computer network

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
