Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring purple objects that get their color from the presence of iodine

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. kelp
2. sea snail shells
3. certain sponges
4. some species of seaweed

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. lavender
6. amethyst
7. eggplant
8. purple cabbage
9. grape juice
10. purple sweet potato
11. violet flowers
12. purple corn
13. acai berries
14. purple carrots
15. purple asparagus
16. purple cauliflower
17. purple sea urchin
18. purple starfish
19. purple coral
20. purple anemone
21. purple quartz
22. purple fluorite
23. purple sea glass
24. purple jellyfish

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
