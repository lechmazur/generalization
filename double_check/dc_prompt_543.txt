Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographic locations that served as capitals of multiple empires but are not currently national capitals.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ravenna
2. Chang'an
3. Persepolis
4. Ctesiphon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Rome
6. Istanbul
7. Beijing
8. Tehran
9. Baghdad
10. Alexandria
11. Athens
12. Delhi
13. Moscow
14. Vienna
15. London
16. Madrid
17. Lisbon
18. Cairo
19. Memphis
20. Kyoto
21. Nanjing
22. Cusco
23. Angkor
24. Carthage

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
