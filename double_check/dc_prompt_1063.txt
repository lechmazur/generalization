Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that combine rhythmic patterns with geometric symmetry in their structure or function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A nautilus shell
2. A sunflower head
3. A crystal lattice
4. A musical canon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A spider web
6. A honeycomb
7. A snowflake
8. A ripple in water
9. A pinecone
10. A fern leaf
11. A Roman mosaic
12. A kaleidoscope pattern
13. A metronome
14. A heartbeat
15. A pendulum
16. A tide
17. A spiral staircase
18. A fingerprint
19. A zebra's stripes
20. A cheetah's spots
21. A tree's rings
22. A DNA molecule
23. A quartz watch
24. A slinky

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
