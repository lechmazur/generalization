Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or human-made objects that exhibit a layered or stratified structure, where each layer has distinct properties or functions, and the overall form is dependent on the interaction of these layers.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. an onion
2. the Earth's atmosphere
3. a multi-layered cake
4. a semiconductor chip

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a tree trunk
6. a river delta
7. a honeycomb
8. a spider web
9. a coral reef
10. a snowflake
11. a sand dune
12. a cloud formation
13. a mountain range
14. a glacier
15. a sedimentary rock
16. a beehive
17. a bird's nest
18. a waterfall
19. a volcano
20. a canyon
21. a stalactite
22. a stalagmite
23. a geode
24. a crystal

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
