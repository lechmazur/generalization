Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices used in industrial settings to monitor and control the flow of liquids

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Rotameter
2. Magnetic flow meter
3. Control valve
4. Orifice plate

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Thermometer
6. Pressure gauge
7. Level sensor
8. Pipeline
9. Pump
10. Valve actuator
11. Storage tank
12. Water meter (residential)
13. Gas meter (residential)
14. Hydrometer
15. Viscometer
16. Spectrophotometer
17. pH meter
18. Conveyor belt
19. Industrial robot
20. PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
21. SCADA system
22. Turbine flow meter (for gases)
23. Hose nozzle
24. Faucet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
