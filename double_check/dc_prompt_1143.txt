Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that involve the transformation of stored energy into a usable form through a controlled process.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Internal combustion engine
2. Fireworks
3. Alkaline battery
4. Jack-in-the-box

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Solar panel
6. Wind turbine
7. Hydroelectric dam
8. Geothermal power plant
9. Light bulb
10. Electric motor
11. Loudspeaker
12. Microphone
13. Transformer
14. Capacitor
15. Inductor
16. Resistor
17. Nuclear reactor
18. Combustion of wood
19. Digestion of food
20. Photosynthesis
21. Lightning strike
22. Static electricity
23. Radio waves
24. Sound waves

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
