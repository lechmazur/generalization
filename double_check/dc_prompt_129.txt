Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that transition from a state of potential or chaos to a structured or functional form through external influence or internal reorganization.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a seed growing into a tree after being planted and watered
2. a jigsaw puzzle being assembled into a complete picture
3. a computer program compiling from source code into an executable application
4. a cloud of gas collapsing under gravity to form a star

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a rock eroding over time
6. a candle burning down
7. a river flowing downstream
8. a snowman melting in the sun
9. a car engine running
10. a clock ticking
11. a book being read
12. a light bulb turning on
13. a tree shedding its leaves
14. a cake being baked
15. a balloon deflating
16. a battery charging
17. a flower blooming
18. a fire spreading
19. a glass breaking
20. a computer booting up
21. a snowflake forming
22. a sandcastle being built
23. a star exploding into a supernova
24. a magnet attracting metal

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
