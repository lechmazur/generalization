Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Elements or concepts that were discovered, developed, or popularized in the early 20th century and have had a lasting impact on their respective fields.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. General Relativity
2. Antibiotics
3. Quantum Mechanics
4. Blood Typing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The internet
6. Personal computer
7. Nuclear weapons
8. Space travel
9. Television
10. The automobile
11. The airplane
12. The assembly line
13. Psychoanalysis
14. Modernism (in art)
15. Jazz music
16. The Great Depression
17. World War I
18. World War II
19. The Cold War
20. The Civil Rights Movement
21. The women's suffrage movement
22. The telephone
23. The radio
24. Motion pictures

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
