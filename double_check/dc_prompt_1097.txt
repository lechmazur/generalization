Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artistic or architectural works that reinterpret ancient structures or styles through modernist or avant-garde perspectives

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye
2. Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum Bilbao
3. Zaha Hadid's MAXXI Museum
4. Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum Berlin

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gothic cathedrals
6. Roman aqueducts
7. Baroque palaces
8. Neoclassical government buildings
9. Art Deco skyscrapers
10. Renaissance paintings
11. Victorian houses
12. Ancient Greek temples
13. Medieval castles
14. Traditional Japanese pagodas
15. Egyptian pyramids
16. Byzantine mosaics
17. Romanesque churches
18. Art Nouveau furniture
19. Colonial American architecture
20. Aztec pyramids
21. Islamic minarets
22. Rococo interiors
23. Pre-Columbian sculptures
24. Gothic Revival architecture

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
