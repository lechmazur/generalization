Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Crystalline solids with a Mohs hardness between 5 and 6 that are primarily composed of silicate minerals.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. jadeite
2. enstatite
3. rhodonite
4. nephrite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. diamond
6. quartz
7. talc
8. gypsum
9. calcite
10. topaz
11. corundum
12. fluorite
13. halite
14. galena
15. pyrite
16. malachite
17. azurite
18. garnet
19. beryl
20. magnetite
21. hematite
22. apatite
23. sphalerite
24. aragonite

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
