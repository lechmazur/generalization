Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or events that occurred in the year 1816 and had significant global impacts on climate, culture, or human history.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia
2. The Year Without a Summer
3. Widespread crop failures and famine in Europe and North America
4. The creation of the poem "Darkness" by Lord Byron

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The eruption of Krakatoa in 1883
6. The Little Ice Age
7. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s
8. The invention of the steam engine
9. The French Revolution
10. The Industrial Revolution
11. The discovery of penicillin
12. The Great Famine of Ireland in the 1840s
13. The publication of "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley
14. The Napoleonic Wars
15. The Louisiana Purchase
16. The War of 1812
17. The invention of the telegraph
18. The California Gold Rush
19. The eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79
20. The Black Death in the 14th century
21. The Renaissance
22. The fall of the Roman Empire
23. The invention of the printing press
24. The American Civil War

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
