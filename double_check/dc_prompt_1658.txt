Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional musical instruments that require circular breathing techniques to produce continuous sound

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. didgeridoo
2. zurna
3. suling
4. nadaswaram

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. trumpet
6. clarinet
7. oboe
8. bagpipes
9. harmonica
10. accordion
11. pan flute
12. saxophone
13. bassoon
14. flute
15. piccolo
16. recorder
17. organ
18. melodica
19. shofar
20. conch shell
21. ocarina
22. shakuhachi
23. alphorn
24. vuvuzela

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
