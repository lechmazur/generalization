Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that have been largely replaced by digital or electronic alternatives but are still used in niche applications due to specific advantages

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Vinyl records
2. Film cameras
3. Mechanical watches
4. Typewriters

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphones
6. LED televisions
7. Electric cars
8. Streaming services
9. Digital cameras
10. Smartwatches
11. Bluetooth speakers
12. eBooks
13. Online banking
14. Cloud storage
15. Video conferencing software
16. Smart home devices
17. 3D printers
18. Virtual reality headsets
19. Digital music players
20. Wireless earbuds
21. Online streaming platforms
22. Digital photo frames
23. Smart thermostats
24. Electric scooters

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
