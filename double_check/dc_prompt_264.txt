Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects smaller than 10 cm that were used as communication devices by non-human entities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Pheromone-emitting gland of an ant
2. Vocal sac of a frog
3. Electrical organ of an electric fish
4. Stridulatory organ of a cricket

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cell phone
6. Walkie-talkie
7. Radio transmitter
8. Telegraph
9. Semaphore flag
10. Smoke signal
11. Morse code device
12. Carrier pigeon
13. Postal service
14. Email
15. Instant messaging app
16. Social media platform
17. Video conferencing software
18. Ham radio
19. Satellite phone
20. Two-way radio
21. Intercom system
22. Public address system
23. Sign language
24. Braille

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
