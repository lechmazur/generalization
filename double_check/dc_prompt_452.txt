Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to create a visual illusion of three-dimensionality on a two-dimensional surface using specific geometric patterns and color contrasts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. An autostereogram depicting a shark
2. A sidewalk chalk drawing that appears to open a chasm in the ground
3. A lenticular print showing a rotating globe
4. An anamorphic skull painted on a table top

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A photograph of a mountain range
6. A holographic sticker
7. A bas-relief sculpture
8. A pop-up book
9. A shadow puppet
10. A trompe-l'Å“il mural of a window
11. A CGI rendering of a spaceship
12. A diorama of a forest scene
13. A forced perspective photograph
14. A painting using atmospheric perspective
15. A virtual reality headset
16. A 3D movie
17. A clay model of a human head
18. An origami crane
19. A kaleidoscope
20. A marble bust
21. A zoetrope
22. A flip book
23. A thaumatrope
24. A mirage

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
