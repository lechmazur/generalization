Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Nuclear power plants that experienced partial core meltdowns while operating at less than 5% of their maximum power output

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Three Mile Island Unit 2
2. Lucens reactor
3. SL-1
4. BORAX-I

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
6. Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant
7. Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station
8. Saint-Laurent Nuclear Power Plant
9. Boiling water reactor
10. Pressurized water reactor
11. CANDU reactor
12. Nuclear fission
13. Nuclear fusion
14. Uranium-235
15. Plutonium-239
16. Control rods
17. Moderator
18. Nuclear chain reaction
19. Radioactive decay
20. Nuclear waste
21. International Atomic Energy Agency
22. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
23. K-19
24. Kursk submarine disaster

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
