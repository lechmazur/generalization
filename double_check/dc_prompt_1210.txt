Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or systems that integrate multiple sensory inputs to create a unified perception or output

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. virtual reality headset
2. human brain
3. autonomous vehicle navigation system
4. robotic surgical system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. telescope
6. microphone
7. thermometer
8. compass
9. radio receiver
10. security camera
11. smoke detector
12. digital camera
13. barometer
14. seismograph
15. radar gun
16. heart rate monitor
17. motion sensor
18. pH meter
19. light meter
20. sonar device
21. wind vane
22. geiger counter
23. spectroscope
24. metal detector

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
