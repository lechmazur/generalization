Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical structures built primarily for defensive purposes using local stone materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hadrian's Wall
2. the Great Wall of China
3. the Tower of London
4. the Fortress of Carcassonne

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the Eiffel Tower
6. the Colosseum
7. the Statue of Liberty
8. the Sydney Opera House
9. the Pyramids of Giza
10. the Taj Mahal
11. the Leaning Tower of Pisa
12. the Golden Gate Bridge
13. the Burj Khalifa
14. the Empire State Building
15. the Parthenon
16. the Lincoln Memorial
17. the Brandenburg Gate
18. the Sagrada Familia
19. the Kremlin
20. the White House
21. the Palace of Versailles
22. the Acropolis
23. the CN Tower
24. the Gateway Arch

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
