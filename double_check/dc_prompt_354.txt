Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical locations that served as prominent settings for fictional depictions of clandestine societies or organizations in published works of fiction.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
2. The Louvre Museum
3. The Overlook Hotel
4. The Great Pyramid of Giza

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Central Park
6. The White House
7. Mount Everest
8. The Eiffel Tower
9. Times Square
10. The Amazon Rainforest
11. The Colosseum
12. The Grand Canyon
13. The Sydney Opera House
14. The Statue of Liberty
15. The Sahara Desert
16. The Great Wall of China
17. The Taj Mahal
18. The Leaning Tower of Pisa
19. The Burj Khalifa
20. The Vatican City
21. The Golden Gate Bridge
22. The Tower of London
23. The Kremlin
24. The Hollywood Sign

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
