Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mythological creatures associated with world-ending events in different cultures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fenrir
2. JÃ¶rmungandr
3. Surtr
4. Quetzalcoatl

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Medusa
6. Minotaur
7. Kraken
8. Chimera
9. Griffin
10. Hydra
11. Phoenix
12. Unicorn
13. Dragon
14. Mermaid
15. Gorgon
16. Yeti
17. Bigfoot
18. Loch Ness Monster
19. Fairy
20. Elf
21. Centaur
22. Satyr
23. Werewolf
24. Vampire

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
