Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Military units that were recruited exclusively from religious or ethnic minorities and given special privileges within their empire's power structure

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Janissary Corps of the Ottoman Empire
2. Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Empire
3. Sikh Khalsa Army under Ranjit Singh
4. Mamluks of the Ayyubid Dynasty

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Roman Legion
6. Mongol Horse Archers
7. Swiss Guard
8. Knights Templar
9. Samurai Warriors
10. Persian Immortals
11. Gurkha Rifles
12. French Foreign Legion
13. Teutonic Knights
14. Ming Dynasty Imperial Guard
15. Spartan Warriors
16. Prussian Guard
17. Cossack Cavalry
18. Saxon Huscarls
19. Ethiopian Imperial Guard
20. Rajput Warriors
21. Norse Vikings
22. Zulu Impis
23. British Royal Guards
24. Spanish Conquistadors

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
