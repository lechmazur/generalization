Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): mechanical devices or systems that use precise, repeatable movements to achieve a specific, often singular function

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. 3D printer
2. sewing machine
3. automatic watch movement
4. CD player laser assembly

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. smartphone
6. electric guitar
7. microwave oven
8. vacuum cleaner
9. refrigerator
10. television
11. laptop
12. blender
13. washing machine
14. air conditioner
15. electric fan
16. toaster
17. coffee maker
18. hair dryer
19. dishwasher
20. radio
21. electric kettle
22. flashlight
23. electric toothbrush
24. digital camera

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
