Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Golden-brown microscopic organisms that form protective shells or cases made primarily of silica

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. diatom
2. pennate diatom
3. centric diatom
4. marine diatom

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. radiolarian
6. foraminifera
7. coccolithophore
8. siliceous sponge
9. coral polyp
10. algae
11. plankton
12. seaweed
13. phytoplankton
14. zooplankton
15. cyanobacteria
16. kelp
17. amoeba
18. paramecium
19. euglena
20. dinoflagellate
21. green algae
22. red algae
23. brown algae
24. spirogyra

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
