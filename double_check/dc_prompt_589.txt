Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Manufactured objects designed to contain a specific smaller object, but found empty and discarded.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A discarded blister pack for allergy medication
2. An empty Altoids tin lying on the sidewalk
3. A crumpled plastic Easter egg found in the grass weeks after the holiday
4. A cardboard toilet paper tube

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A deflated balloon
6. A worn-out shoe
7. An empty bird's nest
8. A hollowed-out log
9. A discarded candy wrapper
10. A used tea bag
11. An empty coffee cup
12. A cracked eggshell
13. A bare tree branch
14. A dry riverbed
15. An empty picture frame
16. A vacant parking space
17. A deserted house
18. An empty wallet
19. A discarded envelope
20. A used matchstick
21. A burnt-out candle
22. An empty bottle of wine
23. A discarded banana peel
24. A rusty tin can

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
