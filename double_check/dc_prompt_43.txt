Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to create controlled, directional flow of a specific granular material using gravity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. hourglass
2. salt shaker
3. grain silo chute
4. sugar dispenser

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. water slide
6. conveyor belt
7. escalator
8. coffee filter
9. rain gutter
10. water fountain
11. pipe
12. funnel
13. sieve
14. colander
15. flour sifter
16. sand castle mold
17. cement mixer
18. ball mill
19. rock tumbler
20. grain elevator
21. pepper grinder
22. sand timer
23. coal chute
24. grain scoop

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
