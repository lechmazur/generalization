Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Paintings depicting flowing, tattered fabric rendered in a Symbolist or Art Nouveau style.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gustav Klimt's "The Three Ages of Woman" (1905)
2. Carlos Schwabe's "The Wave" (1907)
3. Fernand Khnopff's "I Lock My Door Upon Myself" (1891)
4. Jean Delville's "The Angel of Splendor" (1894)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Botticelli's "Birth of Venus" (1485)
6. Alphonse Mucha's "The Seasons" poster series
7. William Blake's "The Ancient of Days" (1794)
8. John William Waterhouse's "The Lady of Shalott" (1888)
9. Gustav Klimt's "The Kiss" (1907)
10. Aubrey Beardsley's "The Peacock Skirt" (1894)
11. El Greco's "The Burial of the Count of Orgaz" (1586)
12. Théophile Steinlen's "Chat Noir" poster (1896)
13. William Morris's textile designs
14. René Lalique's jewelry designs
15. Dante Gabriel Rossetti's "Proserpine" (1874)
16. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's cabaret posters
17. Odilon Redon's "The Cyclops" (1914)
18. Jan van Eyck's "Arnolfini Portrait" (1434)
19. Edward Burne-Jones's "The Golden Stairs" (1880)
20. Georges Seurat's "A Sunday Afternoon" (1884)
21. Edvard Munch's "The Scream" (1893)
22. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes's murals
23. Gustav Moreau's "Jupiter and Semele" (1895)
24. Max Klinger's "The Glove" series (1881)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
