Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments traditionally made with a single piece of wood that have been adapted to use metal strings.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. violin
2. cello
3. double bass
4. viola

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. guitar
6. harp
7. piano
8. banjo
9. mandolin
10. ukulele
11. lute
12. sitar
13. dulcimer
14. lyre
15. zither
16. balalaika
17. bouzouki
18. koto
19. erhu
20. sarangi
21. rebab
22. oud
23. charango
24. hurdy-gurdy

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
