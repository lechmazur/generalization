Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical or computational concepts that were first visualized through traditional cultural practices before being formally defined

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Quipu knot patterns used by Inca civilization for recording numerical data
2. Celtic knot designs demonstrating concepts of infinity and interconnectedness
3. African sand drawings from Angola demonstrating graph theory principles
4. Native American beadwork patterns showing symmetry groups

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic numerals
6. Babylonian base-60 number system
7. Greek geometric proofs
8. Chinese counting rods
9. Mayan calendar calculations
10. Islamic geometric patterns
11. Roman numeral system
12. Japanese temple geometry
13. Aboriginal dot paintings
14. Persian mathematical manuscripts
15. Indian vedic mathematics
16. Polynesian navigation charts
17. African fractal architecture
18. Aztec codex calculations
19. Medieval European abacus
20. Chinese magic squares
21. Native American calendar wheels
22. Mesopotamian clay tablets
23. Viking rune calculations
24. Arabic algorithmic notation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
