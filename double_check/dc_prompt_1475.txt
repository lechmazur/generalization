Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or environments that continue to function autonomously despite being surrounded by actively hostile conditions that would normally prevent their operation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystem
2. A self-sustaining space probe operating in the vacuum of space
3. A desert oasis with its own micro-ecosystem
4. A geothermal power plant in an active volcanic region

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A solar-powered calculator
6. A wind turbine in a windy area
7. A greenhouse in a temperate climate
8. A submarine operating underwater
9. A satellite in Earth's orbit
10. A coal-fired power plant
11. A car driving through a rainstorm
12. A lighthouse on a rocky coast
13. A smartphone with a protective case
14. A nuclear reactor in a controlled environment
15. A ship navigating through calm seas
16. A refrigerator in a kitchen
17. A windmill in a rural area
18. A solar panel on a sunny rooftop
19. A train traveling through a tunnel
20. A drone flying in clear skies
21. A bridge over a river
22. A dam generating hydroelectric power
23. A plane flying at cruising altitude
24. A computer in an air-conditioned office

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
