Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or inventions that were created through a combination of deliberate planning and accidental discovery, resulting in a significant historical or cultural impact

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Penicillin
2. Microwave oven
3. Post-it Notes
4. Velcro

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Light bulb
6. Telephone
7. Printing press
8. Steam engine
9. Airplane
10. Television
11. Computer
12. Internet
13. Smartphone
14. Electric car
15. Refrigerator
16. Washing machine
17. Camera
18. Radio
19. Typewriter
20. Calculator
21. GPS
22. 3D printer
23. Drone
24. Solar panel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
