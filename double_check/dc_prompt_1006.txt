Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or materials that combine a metallic element with a non-metallic or artistic component to serve a functional or aesthetic purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A decorative wrought iron gate with intricate glass inlays
2. A stainless steel pen with a wooden grip
3. A bronze sculpture with embedded gemstones
4. A copper kitchen utensil with a ceramic handle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A silver necklace
6. A wooden sculpture
7. A plastic toy car
8. A gold ring
9. A ceramic vase
10. A leather wallet
11. A glass paperweight
12. A cotton t-shirt
13. A rubber ball
14. A silk scarf
15. A wool sweater
16. A paper notebook
17. A nylon backpack
18. A denim jacket
19. A polyester dress
20. A linen tablecloth
21. A velvet cushion
22. A bamboo cutting board
23. A porcelain teacup
24. A canvas painting

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
