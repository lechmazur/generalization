Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): 20th-century American composers who incorporated folk music into their orchestral works

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Aaron Copland
2. Roy Harris
3. Henry Cowell
4. Charles Ives

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Leonard Bernstein
6. George Gershwin
7. Béla Bartók
8. Ralph Vaughan Williams
9. John Cage
10. Samuel Barber
11. Percy Grainger
12. Gustav Holst
13. Igor Stravinsky
14. Elliott Carter
15. Philip Glass
16. Steve Reich
17. Morton Feldman
18. Roger Sessions
19. Milton Babbitt
20. Amy Beach
21. Charles Griffes
22. Walter Piston
23. William Grant Still
24. Howard Hanson

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
