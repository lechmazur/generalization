Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that utilize a slow, consistent, and regulated release of stored resources to maintain a specific function over an extended period.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Osmotic pump for drug delivery
2. Hourglass
3. Incense stick
4. Drip irrigation system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A battery
6. A fuel tank
7. A water reservoir
8. A capacitor
9. A spring
10. A glacier
11. A volcano
12. A geyser
13. A river
14. A dam
15. A balloon
16. A tire
17. A fire extinguisher
18. A can of compressed air
19. A grain silo
20. An hourglass filled with sand but blocked
21. A loaded crossbow
22. A roll of toilet paper
23. A bag of chips
24. A bottle of wine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
