Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations in the early 20th century that significantly influenced fashion design and are named after their creators.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fortuny pleats
2. Poiret belly-dancer silhouette
3. Chanel suit
4. Vionnet bias cut

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Art Deco architecture
6. Cubism
7. T-shirt
8. Zipper
9. Synthetic dyes
10. Flapper dresses
11. A-line skirt
12. Pencil skirt
13. Little black dress
14. Trench coat
15. Rayon
16. Nylon
17. Bakelite jewelry
18. Cloche hat
19. Mary Janes
20. Oxford shoes
21. Surrealism
22. Bauhaus
23. Ready-to-wear clothing
24. Mass production of clothing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
