Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for focused illumination in specialized cultural or scientific settings

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. surgical headlight
2. planetarium projector
3. microscope illuminator
4. forensic photography UV light

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. desk lamp
6. streetlight
7. flashlight
8. headlamp (for camping)
9. spotlight (theater)
10. candle
11. oil lamp
12. ceiling fan with light
13. lava lamp
14. Christmas lights
15. camera flash
16. lighthouse beacon
17. traffic light
18. neon sign
19. firefly
20. sun
21. moon
22. stars
23. laser pointer
24. optical fiber

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
