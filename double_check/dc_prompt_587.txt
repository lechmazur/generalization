Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize a central, immutable reference point to coordinate dynamic, distributed components.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. GPS satellite system
2. Blockchain ledger
3. Domain Name System (DNS)
4. Network Time Protocol (NTP)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a local area network (LAN)
6. a peer-to-peer file sharing network
7. a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
8. a social media platform
9. a cloud storage service
10. a distributed database
11. a mesh network
12. a content delivery network (CDN)
13. a virtual private network (VPN)
14. a smart home system
15. a microservices architecture
16. a load balancing system
17. a server cluster
18. a video conferencing tool
19. a wireless sensor network
20. a collaborative editing tool
21. a streaming service
22. a search engine
23. a virtual reality environment
24. a multiplayer online game

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
