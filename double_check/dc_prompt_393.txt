Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize predictive modeling based on probabilistic estimations of future states to optimize real-time decision-making.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a traffic management system that predicts congestion and adjusts signal timings in real-time
2. a stock trading algorithm that forecasts market trends to execute optimal trades
3. a healthcare system that predicts patient deterioration and recommends interventions
4. a supply chain optimization tool that anticipates demand fluctuations and adjusts inventory levels

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a weather forecasting app
6. a recommendation system for streaming services
7. a fraud detection algorithm in banking
8. a self-driving car navigation system
9. a predictive maintenance tool for industrial machinery
10. a customer churn prediction model
11. a spam filter for email systems
12. a credit scoring system
13. a personalized advertising platform
14. a disease outbreak prediction model
15. a sports analytics tool for player performance
16. a voice recognition system
17. a facial recognition security system
18. a language translation app
19. a sentiment analysis tool for social media
20. a route optimization app for delivery services
21. a crop yield prediction system for agriculture
22. a real-time language processing chatbot
23. a dynamic pricing system for e-commerce
24. a risk assessment tool for insurance companies

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
