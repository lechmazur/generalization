Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices that utilize a differential gear to apportion power or motion between two outputs.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Rear axle of a Toyota Camry
2. Spider gear assembly in a John Deere tractor
3. Center differential in a Subaru WRX STI
4. Transfer case in a Jeep Wrangler 4x4

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bicycle chain drive
6. Manual transmission gearbox
7. Belt-driven pulley system
8. Rack and pinion steering
9. Hydraulic power steering pump
10. Timing belt assembly
11. Windshield wiper motor
12. Automatic transmission torque converter
13. Electric window motor
14. Planetary gear set
15. CV joint
16. Limited slip clutch pack
17. Camshaft drive mechanism
18. Power take-off shaft
19. Alternator pulley system
20. Starter motor drive
21. Drum brake mechanism
22. Throttle body assembly
23. Distributor drive gear
24. Crankshaft assembly

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
