Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that rely on precise alignment or synchronization of multiple components to function effectively.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a mechanical watch
2. a phased array radar system
3. a high-speed printing press
4. a ballet performance

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bicycle chain
6. a network of computers
7. a solar panel array
8. a musical ensemble
9. a conveyor belt system
10. a series of interconnected gears
11. a fleet of drones
12. a set of traffic lights
13. a group of synchronized swimmers
14. a row of dominoes
15. a series of pulleys
16. a set of wind turbines
17. a collection of satellites
18. a group of dancers
19. a set of interlocking Lego pieces
20. a series of conveyor belts
21. a network of roads
22. a set of interconnected pipes
23. a group of synchronized clocks
24. a series of linked chains

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
