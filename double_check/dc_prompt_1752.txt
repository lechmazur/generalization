Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Spaces designed for contemplation that incorporate natural elements and minimalist aesthetics

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A secluded, open-air pavilion with a smooth stone floor, surrounded by a bamboo grove, featuring a single bonsai tree
2. A sun-drenched room with white walls, a single window overlooking a rock garden, and a low wooden platform for seated meditation
3. A minimalist concrete courtyard with a shallow reflecting pool, pebbles arranged in a circular pattern, and a single, strategically placed flowering succulent
4. A simple wooden cabin in a forest clearing, with large windows offering views of the surrounding trees, furnished with a single woven mat and a small, rustic table

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A brightly colored playroom with large windows
6. A bustling urban rooftop garden with colorful flowers and seating areas
7. An ornate Victorian conservatory filled with exotic plants
8. A rustic log cabin with a fireplace and taxidermied animals on the walls
9. A modern art gallery with large abstract paintings
10. A home library with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and comfortable armchairs
11. A dark, enclosed sensory deprivation tank
12. A brightly lit yoga studio with mirrors and exercise equipment
13. A traditional Japanese tea room with tatami mats and intricate scrollwork
14. A minimalist bedroom with a platform bed and a single piece of abstract art
15. A greenhouse filled with a variety of tropical plants
16. A public park with a large pond and walking paths
17. A botanical garden with labeled plants and educational displays
18. A church sanctuary with stained glass windows and religious iconography
19. A mountaintop retreat with panoramic views and luxurious amenities
20. A desert landscape with cacti and rock formations
21. A beach with white sand and clear blue water
22. A waterfall cascading down a rocky cliff
23. A forest trail winding through dense trees
24. A field of wildflowers swaying in the breeze

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
