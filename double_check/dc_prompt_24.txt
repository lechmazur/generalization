Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or practices developed in the 15th to 16th centuries that were influenced by religious or spiritual beliefs and aimed to enhance safety or ritualistic experience.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hamsa amulets worn for protection from the evil eye.
2. Elaborate reliquaries designed to house sacred relics and enhance veneration.
3. The printing press used to disseminate religious texts like the Bible, increasing access to spiritual teachings.
4. Apothecary gardens cultivated by monastic orders for medicinal purposes and spiritual contemplation.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Telescope
6. Flush toilet
7. Matchlock musket
8. Caravel ship
9. Oil painting on canvas
10. Perspective in art
11. Sonnet form in poetry
12. Madrigal music
13. Globe
14. Compass
15. Astrolabe
16. Crossbow
17. Plate armor
18. Spinning wheel
19. Printing press used for scientific texts
20. Herbal remedies developed through secular observation
21. Fortified castles
22. Cathedrals built for displaying wealth and power
23. Secular portraiture
24. Opera

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
