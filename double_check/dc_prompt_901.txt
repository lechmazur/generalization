Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical constructs named after mythical or legendary places or figures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Euclidean geometry
2. Gaussian distribution
3. Hamiltonian path
4. Pythagorean theorem

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Newton's laws of motion
6. Leibniz notation
7. Archimedean spiral
8. Fourier transform
9. Laplace transform
10. Boolean algebra
11. Cartesian coordinates
12. Euler's formula
13. Galois theory
14. Hilbert space
15. Kronecker delta
16. Lagrange multiplier
17. Mandelbrot set
18. Poisson distribution
19. Riemann zeta function
20. Shannon entropy
21. Turing machine
22. Venn diagram
23. Weierstrass function
24. Young tableau

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
