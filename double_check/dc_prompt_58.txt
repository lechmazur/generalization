Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Microscopic images of crystalline structures found in naturally occurring evaporite deposits.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a hexagonal crystal lattice with visible halite formations
2. a dendritic pattern of gypsum crystals under polarized light
3. a cubic arrangement of sylvite crystals with distinct cleavage planes
4. a fibrous cluster of anhydrite crystals with striated surfaces

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a photograph of a snowflake under a microscope
6. a scanning electron microscope image of a butterfly wing
7. a close-up of a quartz geode
8. a microscopic view of a human hair strand
9. a magnified image of a pollen grain
10. a thin section of a volcanic rock under a microscope
11. a microscopic image of a diatom
12. a close-up of a saltwater droplet drying on a glass slide
13. a microscopic view of a sand grain
14. a magnified image of a metal alloy structure
15. a microscopic photograph of a plant cell
16. a close-up of a soap bubble film
17. a microscopic image of a blood cell
18. a magnified view of a spider silk thread
19. a microscopic photograph of a bacterial colony
20. a close-up of a mineral inclusion in a gemstone
21. a microscopic image of a fossilized bone
22. a magnified view of a leaf stomata
23. a microscopic photograph of a coral skeleton
24. a close-up of a synthetic polymer structure

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
