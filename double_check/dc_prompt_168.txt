Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring cyclic processes that simultaneously create and destroy the same material

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The water cycle
2. The carbon cycle
3. The nitrogen cycle
4. The phosphorus cycle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The life cycle of a butterfly
6. The process of photosynthesis
7. The rock cycle
8. The process of cellular respiration
9. The lunar cycle
10. The process of decomposition
11. The seasonal cycle
12. The process of erosion
13. The day-night cycle
14. The process of volcanic activity
15. The annual migration of animals
16. The process of ocean currents
17. The growth cycle of plants
18. The process of tectonic plate movement
19. The menstrual cycle
20. The process of glacier formation and melting
21. The circadian rhythm
22. The process of star formation and death
23. The annual cycle of temperature
24. The process of coral reef growth and erosion

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
