Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Survival techniques that originated from traditional winter activities and were later adopted by military forces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Igloo construction techniques used by Inuit for shelter, later adapted by military for Arctic survival training
2. Snowshoeing, originally used by indigenous peoples for winter travel, later adopted by military for mobility in snowy conditions
3. Ice fishing methods developed by traditional communities, later utilized by military for food sourcing in cold climates
4. Use of animal furs for warmth, a practice from indigenous winter survival, later integrated into military cold weather gear

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Parachuting techniques developed for military operations
6. Fire-starting methods used by survivalists in various climates
7. Raft building skills taught in survival courses
8. Compass navigation techniques used by hikers and military personnel
9. Desert survival strategies focusing on water conservation
10. Jungle survival techniques involving shelter construction from foliage
11. Urban survival skills for navigating cityscapes during emergencies
12. First aid techniques developed for battlefield injuries
13. Knot-tying skills used in sailing and mountaineering
14. Signaling methods for rescue operations in remote areas
15. Water purification methods used in various survival scenarios
16. Tracking skills used by hunters and military scouts
17. Camouflage techniques developed for military concealment
18. Booby trap detection and disarmament skills taught to military personnel
19. Edible plant identification used in wilderness survival
20. Map reading skills essential for navigation in military operations
21. Hand-to-hand combat techniques developed for military use
22. Radio communication protocols used by military and emergency services
23. Survival swimming techniques taught to military divers
24. Escape and evasion strategies used by military personnel in hostile territories

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
