Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts that integrate social interaction with structured knowledge representation in digital environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Collaborative ontology development platforms
2. Social semantic wikis
3. Folksonomy-based knowledge organization systems
4. Community-driven taxonomies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Database management systems
6. Social media platforms
7. Online forums
8. Digital libraries
9. Content management systems
10. Email clients
11. Search engines
12. Knowledge graphs
13. XML schemas
14. Chat applications
15. Document sharing platforms
16. Mind mapping software
17. Project management tools
18. Virtual learning environments
19. Cloud storage services
20. Metadata repositories
21. Digital asset management systems
22. Version control systems
23. Enterprise resource planning systems
24. Business intelligence tools

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
