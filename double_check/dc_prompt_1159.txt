Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that incorporate both natural and artificial elements in their design or function, where the natural element is essential to the artificial component's purpose or aesthetic.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a bioluminescent lamp powered by living algae
2. a wooden chair with a live moss cushion
3. a water filtration system using natural reed beds
4. a ceramic vase with embedded seeds that sprout into plants

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a plastic water bottle
6. a metal wrench
7. a glass window
8. a rubber tire
9. a cotton T-shirt
10. a concrete sidewalk
11. a synthetic leather jacket
12. a stainless steel spoon
13. a nylon rope
14. a polyester curtain
15. a paper notebook
16. a wooden table
17. a brick wall
18. a silk scarf
19. a plastic flower
20. a glass marble
21. a metal keychain
22. a rubber ball
23. a ceramic mug
24. a cardboard box

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
