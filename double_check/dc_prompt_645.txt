Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Folkloric entities that serve as both protectors and antagonists within their narratives, often associated with nature or the supernatural.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a forest spirit that guards sacred groves but curses trespassers
2. a river nymph who aids fishermen but drowns those who disrespect her waters
3. a mountain troll that protects travelers but punishes those who exploit the land
4. a shapeshifting wolf that defends villages but hunts those who break ancient pacts

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a vampire that preys on humans but protects its own kind
6. a ghost that haunts a house but helps its former family
7. a dragon that hoards treasure but spares those who offer gifts
8. a witch who curses intruders but heals those who seek her aid
9. a guardian angel that protects its charge but punishes wrongdoers
10. a demon that grants wishes but demands a heavy price
11. a siren that lures sailors but spares those who resist her song
12. a phoenix that destroys with fire but brings renewal
13. a golem that defends its creator but turns on those who misuse it
14. a banshee whose wail foretells death but warns the innocent
15. a trickster god who causes chaos but rewards cleverness
16. a mermaid who saves drowning sailors but curses those who betray her
17. a werewolf that hunts humans but protects its pack
18. a fairy that grants blessings but curses those who break promises
19. a chimera that terrorizes villages but spares those who offer tribute
20. a leprechaun who grants wishes but tricks the greedy
21. a basilisk that petrifies intruders but spares those who avoid its gaze
22. a unicorn that heals the pure but attacks the corrupt
23. a kraken that sinks ships but spares those who honor the sea
24. a thunderbird that brings storms but protects sacred lands

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
