Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures that were deliberately hidden or sealed away by their creators specifically to prevent others from studying or replicating their design

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the Antikythera mechanism
2. the Voynich manuscript
3. the Terracotta Army's weapons
4. the Baghdad Battery

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a time capsule
6. a buried treasure chest
7. a secret diary
8. a hidden bunker
9. a locked safe
10. a forgotten library
11. a sealed tomb
12. a classified document
13. a sunken shipwreck
14. a lost city
15. a hidden map
16. a secret recipe
17. a concealed weapon
18. a buried artifact
19. a forgotten invention
20. a sealed letter
21. a hidden compartment
22. a secret laboratory
23. a lost manuscript
24. a concealed treasure map

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
