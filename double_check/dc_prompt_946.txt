Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological systems that utilize distributed ledger technology to enhance transparency and security in supply chain management.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a blockchain-based system for tracking the origin of organic produce
2. a decentralized ledger for verifying the authenticity of luxury goods
3. a distributed ledger platform for monitoring pharmaceutical supply chains
4. a blockchain solution for ensuring ethical sourcing of conflict-free minerals

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a centralized inventory management software
6. a traditional barcode tracking system
7. a cloud-based CRM platform
8. a manual paper-based record-keeping system
9. a GPS tracking system for fleet management
10. a machine learning algorithm for demand forecasting
11. a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagging system
12. a digital payment gateway for e-commerce
13. a cybersecurity tool for protecting financial transactions
14. a smart contract platform for real estate transactions
15. a peer-to-peer file-sharing network
16. a cryptocurrency wallet application
17. a blockchain-based voting system
18. a decentralized social media platform
19. a digital identity verification system
20. a supply chain analytics dashboard
21. a warehouse management system
22. a blockchain-based art authentication platform
23. a distributed computing network for scientific research
24. a blockchain-based energy trading platform

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
