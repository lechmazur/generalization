Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments traditionally played by women in specific indigenous cultures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. tingsha cymbals in Tibet
2. kisanji thumb piano in Zimbabwe
3. qeej bamboo pipes among Hmong people
4. sarangi fiddle in Nepal

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. djembe drum
6. classical piano
7. electric guitar
8. Celtic harp
9. tambourine
10. didgeridoo
11. Native American flute
12. African talking drum
13. sitar
14. bagpipes
15. steel drums
16. accordion
17. pan pipes
18. balalaika
19. mandolin
20. ukulele
21. bongos
22. shakuhachi
23. dulcimer
24. ocarina

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
