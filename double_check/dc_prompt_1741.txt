Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Public monuments completed in the 20th century that depict historical figures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mount Rushmore National Memorial
2. Lincoln Memorial
3. Statue of Liberty
4. Christ the Redeemer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Washington Monument
6. Arc de Triomphe
7. Vietnam Veterans Memorial
8. Gateway Arch
9. Eiffel Tower
10. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
11. The Motherland Calls
12. Nelson's Column
13. Brandenburg Gate
14. Palace of Versailles
15. Taj Mahal
16. Statue of David
17. The Thinker
18. Venus de Milo
19. Great Sphinx of Giza
20. Moai Statues
21. Terracotta Army
22. The Little Mermaid
23. World War II Memorial
24. Korean War Veterans Memorial

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
