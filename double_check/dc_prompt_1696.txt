Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or human-made structures that create a sustained, visible vortex pattern in liquid without external power sources

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Whirlpool in a river
2. Dust devil over a dry lake bed
3. Vortex created by a draining bathtub
4. Maelstrom in the ocean

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Tornado
6. Hurricane
7. Electric fan creating a vortex in water
8. Water swirling in a blender
9. Smoke ring from a chimney
10. Spiral galaxy
11. Vortex created by a stirring spoon
12. Vortex in a wind tunnel
13. Vortex created by a jet engine
14. Swirling leaves in a gust of wind
15. Vortex in a laboratory experiment with pumps
16. Vortex created by a helicopter rotor
17. Vortex in a washing machine
18. Vortex created by a water fountain
19. Vortex in a stirred cup of coffee
20. Vortex created by a vacuum cleaner
21. Vortex in a stirred pot of soup
22. Vortex created by a ceiling fan
23. Vortex in a swimming pool with jets
24. Vortex created by a propeller in water

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
