Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Medieval European literary works first published posthumously

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight
2. The Canterbury Tales
3. Le Morte d'Arthur
4. The Divine Comedy

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Beowulf
6. The Song of Roland
7. The Decameron
8. The Book of Margery Kempe
9. The Romance of the Rose
10. The Lais of Marie de France
11. The Pearl Poet
12. The Travels of Sir John Mandeville
13. The Vision of Piers Plowman
14. The Consolation of Philosophy
15. The Canterbury Tales (published during Chaucer's lifetime)
16. The Divine Comedy (published during Dante's lifetime)
17. The Decameron (published during Boccaccio's lifetime)
18. The Book of the City of Ladies
19. The Canterbury Tales (modern adaptation)
20. The Song of the Nibelungs
21. The Saga of the Volsungs
22. The Poetic Edda
23. The Prose Edda
24. The Canterbury Tales (abridged version)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
