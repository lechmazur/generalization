Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used to announce or record one's presence that were commonly found in Victorian-era gentlemen's clubs and luxury travel accommodations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a brass nameplate
2. a leather-bound guestbook
3. a silver calling card tray
4. a monogrammed stationery set

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a pocket watch
6. a walking cane
7. a top hat
8. a cigar case
9. a whiskey decanter
10. a chess set
11. a fireplace poker
12. a velvet armchair
13. a chandelier
14. a gramophone
15. a leather suitcase
16. a steamer trunk
17. a ship's bell
18. a compass
19. a telescope
20. a map of the British Empire
21. a quill pen
22. a wax seal stamp
23. a framed portrait
24. a grandfather clock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
