Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Methods of cultural exchange facilitated by historical trade routes that significantly influenced music genres.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The spread of Arabic maqam scales along the Silk Road influencing Central Asian musical traditions
2. Portuguese fado's development through maritime spice trade routes connecting to African and Asian rhythms
3. The fusion of Spanish flamenco with Moorish musical elements via Mediterranean trade networks
4. The evolution of Gamelan through Indian Ocean trade routes connecting Indonesian and South Asian musical traditions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the piano in Italy
6. African drums used in tribal ceremonies
7. Classical Greek musical notation systems
8. Traditional Chinese erhu construction techniques
9. Viking drinking songs and chants
10. Native American flute crafting methods
11. Medieval European church hymns
12. Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo traditions
13. Japanese court music compositions
14. Celtic folk song preservation
15. Russian ballet music development
16. Aztec ceremonial instruments
17. Persian classical music theory
18. Indian classical raga structure
19. West African griot storytelling
20. Polynesian vocal harmonies
21. Mongolian throat singing techniques
22. Ancient Egyptian musical hieroglyphs
23. Inuit drum dance traditions
24. Korean palace music ceremonies

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
