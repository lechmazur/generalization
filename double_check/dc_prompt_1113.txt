Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): rituals or ceremonies that blend ancient traditions with modern minimalism, emphasizing symbolic gestures over elaborate displays

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A tea ceremony performed in an empty white room with just one ceramic cup
2. A wedding where couples exchange recycled metal rings while standing in silence
3. A coming-of-age celebration using only water and a single candle
4. A house blessing ritual using only salt and natural light

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional Native American powwow
6. A Catholic mass with full choir and incense
7. A Tibetan sand mandala creation
8. A Japanese cherry blossom festival
9. A modern art gallery opening
10. A corporate team building exercise
11. A graduation ceremony
12. An elaborate Hindu wedding
13. A Chinese New Year parade
14. A Scandinavian midsummer celebration
15. A meditation retreat
16. A baptism ceremony
17. An Olympic opening ceremony
18. A military funeral
19. A bar mitzvah celebration
20. A harvest moon festival
21. A modern dance performance
22. A presidential inauguration
23. A traditional African naming ceremony
24. A Zen garden dedication

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
