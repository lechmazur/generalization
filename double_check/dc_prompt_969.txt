Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations designed to enhance human interaction with natural environments through sensory feedback mechanisms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A haptic glove that simulates different tree bark textures for forest research
2. A bioacoustic headset that amplifies and identifies bird calls in real-time
3. A thermal feedback device that helps track animal movements in darkness
4. A vibrotactile belt that communicates underwater current directions to divers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional compass
6. A pair of binoculars
7. A wildlife camera trap
8. A handheld GPS device
9. A weather station
10. A metal detector
11. A seismograph
12. An underwater camera
13. A drone with camera
14. A satellite tracking collar
15. A soil moisture meter
16. A wind speed indicator
17. A water quality tester
18. An altimeter watch
19. A trail mapping app
20. A plant identification scanner
21. A UV index meter
22. A fish finder device
23. A geological sampling tool
24. A night vision scope

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
