Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or man-made objects that combine two distinct, seemingly unrelated elements or concepts in their name or form, creating a unique or unexpected identity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Thunderbird
2. Butterfly
3. Pineapple
4. Firefly

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Hybrid car
6. Multitool
7. Combination lock
8. Amphibian vehicle
9. Smartphone
10. Swiss Army knife
11. Convertible car
12. Transformer toy
13. Blender
14. Microwave oven
15. Laptop
16. Tablet
17. Smartwatch
18. E-reader
19. Headphones
20. Drone
21. 3D printer
22. Virtual reality headset
23. Augmented reality glasses
24. Wearable fitness tracker

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
