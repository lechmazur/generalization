Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or systems that involve solving complex problems through simplification or abstraction

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. flowcharts
2. mathematical models
3. decision trees
4. mind mapping

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. calculators
6. microscopes
7. dictionaries
8. instruction manuals
9. road signs
10. compasses
11. rulers
12. checklists
13. spreadsheets
14. calendars
15. blueprints
16. weather forecasts
17. clocks
18. thermometers
19. scales
20. maps
21. diagrams
22. indexes
23. outlines
24. summaries

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
