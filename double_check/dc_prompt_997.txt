Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical journeys that significantly influenced the development of a scientific theory or philosophy

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Darwin's voyage on the HMS Beagle
2. Alexander von Humboldt's Latin American expedition
3. Alfred Russel Wallace's Malay Archipelago exploration
4. Ibn Battuta's journey through Asia and Africa

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Marco Polo's travels to China
6. Lewis and Clark expedition
7. Christopher Columbus's voyages
8. Magellan's circumnavigation
9. Neil Armstrong's moon landing
10. Amelia Earhart's final flight
11. Roald Amundsen's South Pole expedition
12. Edmund Hillary's Mount Everest climb
13. Vasco da Gama's route to India
14. James Cook's Pacific voyages
15. Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki expedition
16. Zheng He's maritime expeditions
17. Ernest Shackleton's Antarctic journey
18. Ibn Fadlan's journey to the Volga Bulgars
19. Robert Peary's Arctic expedition
20. Bartolomeu Dias's Cape of Good Hope voyage
21. John Franklin's Northwest Passage expedition
22. David Livingstone's African explorations
23. Yuri Gagarin's space flight
24. Sir Francis Drake's circumnavigation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
