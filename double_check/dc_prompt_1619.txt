Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient religious sites that were deliberately flooded or submerged to prevent their desecration by invading forces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the ancient city of Saeftinghe, submerged to protect its sacred sites from Viking raids
2. the temple complex of Mahabalipuram, partially flooded to shield it from invading armies
3. the submerged ruins of Yonaguni, believed to have been intentionally flooded to preserve its spiritual significance
4. the sacred springs of Bath, England, which were deliberately flooded to prevent their desecration during Roman invasions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the Parthenon in Athens
6. the Great Pyramid of Giza
7. Stonehenge in England
8. the Colosseum in Rome
9. Machu Picchu in Peru
10. Angkor Wat in Cambodia
11. the Temple of Karnak in Egypt
12. the Acropolis in Greece
13. the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul
14. the Borobudur Temple in Indonesia
15. the Shwedagon Pagoda in Myanmar
16. the Temple of Artemis in Turkey
17. the Temple of Heaven in China
18. the Meenakshi Temple in India
19. the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem
20. the Temple of Poseidon in Greece
21. the Temple of Apollo in Delphi
22. the Temple of Luxor in Egypt
23. the Temple of Hera in Italy
24. the Temple of Zeus in Greece

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
