Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional handcrafted textiles that incorporate symbolic patterns representing cultural or spiritual beliefs.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Navajo weaving incorporating geometric patterns representing the four cardinal directions and spiritual deities.
2. An Andean textile featuring stylized depictions of condors and other animals, symbolizing connection to the natural world and ancestral spirits.
3. An Indonesian batik cloth with intricate floral motifs representing life, growth, and the interconnectedness of all beings.
4. A Hmong tapestry embroidered with stylized figures and symbols representing clan history, migration stories, and spiritual beliefs.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A machine-made Persian rug with traditional patterns.
6. A tie-dye t-shirt with a spiral pattern.
7. A crocheted blanket with a geometric design.
8. A hand-knitted sweater with a cable knit pattern.
9. A printed scarf with paisley motifs.
10. A mass-produced tapestry depicting a historical scene.
11. A quilt made with scraps of fabric in a patchwork design.
12. An embroidered pillowcase with floral patterns.
13. A woven basket with a decorative border.
14. A macrame wall hanging with knotted patterns.
15. A piece of lace with intricate floral designs.
16. A digitally printed fabric with abstract patterns.
17. A hand-painted silk scarf with a landscape design.
18. A beaded necklace with a geometric pattern.
19. A leather belt with embossed designs.
20. A ceramic tile with a hand-painted floral motif.
21. A wooden carving with intricate patterns.
22. A metal sculpture with decorative elements.
23. A stained glass window with geometric shapes.
24. A piece of calligraphy with decorative flourishes.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
