Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for precise measurement or calibration that rely on a fixed physical constant.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Krypton-86 lamp
2. Triple point cell
3. Josephson voltage standard
4. Cesium atomic clock

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ruler
6. Thermometer
7. Balance scale
8. Graduated cylinder
9. Beaker
10. Stopwatch
11. Protractor
12. Compass
13. Calipers
14. Micrometer
15. Speedometer
16. Odometer
17. Barometer
18. Hydrometer
19. Voltmeter
20. Ammeter
21. Ohmmeter
22. Light meter
23. Sound level meter
24. pH meter

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
