Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine a physical or symbolic spiral structure with a functional or cultural significance tied to storytelling or communication.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the spiral staircase in a lighthouse
2. the spiral structure of a conch shell used as a horn
3. the spiral-bound notebook used for writing stories
4. the spiral galaxy depicted in a mythological tale

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a straight road
6. a flat piece of paper
7. a digital clock
8. a rectangular book
9. a linear timeline
10. a square painting
11. a flat map
12. a straight ladder
13. a rectangular window
14. a flat screen TV
15. a straight river
16. a rectangular table
17. a flat mirror
18. a straight line of text
19. a flat canvas
20. a straight path
21. a rectangular photograph
22. a flat board game
23. a straight beam of light
24. a flat smartphone screen

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
