Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Media personalities or public figures who gained fame through an unconventional aesthetic that deliberately mixed high and low cultural elements in their personal presentation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Lady Gaga
2. Andy Warhol
3. RuPaul
4. David Bowie

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Madonna
6. Salvador Dali
7. Marilyn Monroe
8. Elvis Presley
9. Prince
10. Pablo Picasso
11. Michael Jackson
12. Grace Jones
13. Oscar Wilde
14. Freddie Mercury
15. Marcel Duchamp
16. Boy George
17. Jean-Michel Basquiat
18. Elton John
19. Keith Haring
20. Vivienne Westwood
21. John Waters
22. Annie Lennox
23. Jeff Koons
24. Leigh Bowery

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
