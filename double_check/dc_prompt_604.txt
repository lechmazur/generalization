Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or depictions of objects that feature a prominent, flexible, elongated appendage used for grasping, manipulating, or interacting with the environment, where the appendage is clearly distinct from the main body and not primarily used for locomotion.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. an octopus
2. an elephant
3. a chameleon
4. a monkey

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a snake
6. a giraffe
7. a kangaroo
8. a jellyfish
9. a starfish
10. a centipede
11. a caterpillar
12. a worm
13. a sea anemone
14. a squid
15. a seahorse
16. a praying mantis
17. a scorpion
18. a spider
19. a grasshopper
20. an ant
21. a lobster
22. a crab
23. a sea cucumber
24. a millipede

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
