Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical systems designed for managing the efficient allocation and utilization of a finite resource within a defined spatial area.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Irrigation canals and reservoirs network for agricultural land
2. A smart grid for electricity distribution in a city
3. Traffic management system with adaptive signal control for a metropolitan area
4. Natural gas pipeline network with compressor stations and storage facilities

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A library cataloging system
6. A database for managing customer information
7. A social media platform
8. A search engine algorithm
9. A supply chain management software
10. A project management tool
11. An online learning platform
12. A financial trading platform
13. A hospital patient management system
14. An air traffic control system
15. A railway scheduling system
16. A shipping logistics platform
17. A warehouse inventory management system
18. A manufacturing execution system
19. A customer relationship management (CRM) system
20. An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system
21. A content management system (CMS)
22. A version control system (e.g., Git)
23. A cloud computing platform
24. A cybersecurity system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
