Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures designed to physically adapt to changing environmental conditions using integrated sensor and actuator systems.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a building facade that adjusts its shading elements based on real-time sunlight intensity
2. a bridge with sensors that modify its structural tension in response to wind speed and load
3. a roof system that changes its shape to optimize rainwater collection during storms
4. a pavilion with walls that expand or contract to regulate internal temperature based on weather conditions

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a solar panel array
6. a wind turbine
7. a smart thermostat
8. a retractable stadium roof
9. a self-cleaning glass window
10. a geothermal heating system
11. a motion-activated lighting system
12. a water filtration system
13. a green wall with automated irrigation
14. a smart home security system
15. a weather station
16. a flood barrier
17. a ventilation system with manual controls
18. a traditional brick wall
19. a static concrete bridge
20. a fixed glass skylight
21. a passive solar heating design
22. a manual window blind
23. a standard air conditioning unit
24. a non-adjustable steel beam

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
