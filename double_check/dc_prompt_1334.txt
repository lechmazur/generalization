Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical systems or devices that incorporate both repetitive motion and adaptive adjustments to maintain functionality under varying conditions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. windshield wipers
2. sewing machine
3. automatic transmission
4. grandfather clock

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. bicycle chain
6. pendulum
7. rocking chair
8. metronome
9. ceiling fan
10. manual gearbox
11. water wheel
12. conveyor belt
13. spinning wheel
14. carousel
15. piston engine
16. wind turbine
17. mechanical calculator
18. music box
19. typewriter
20. analog watch
21. printing press
22. steam engine
23. hydraulic pump
24. potter's wheel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
