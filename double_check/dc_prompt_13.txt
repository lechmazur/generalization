Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural festivals or events that originated as a response to a specific historical crisis or disaster and have persisted as an annual tradition.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The ÅŒtsu Matsuri in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, a vibrant festival with a history rooted in appeasing the gods after a devastating plague in the 17th century.
2. The Festival of the Redeemer in Venice, Italy, a celebration initially held to give thanks for the end of a devastating plague in 1576.
3. The Bon Festival in Japan, a Buddhist tradition that evolved to incorporate elements of ancestor worship and remembrance, particularly after widespread famine and epidemics in the 9th century.
4. The Flower Festival in Panchimalco, El Salvador, a vibrant display of intricate floral carpets originally created as a plea for divine intervention during a period of intense seismic activity in the 19th century.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Oktoberfest
6. Carnival in Rio de Janeiro
7. Dia de los Muertos
8. Chinese New Year
9. Holi
10. Thanksgiving
11. Christmas
12. Hanukkah
13. Diwali
14. Ramadan
15. St. Patrick's Day
16. Bastille Day
17. Cinco de Mayo
18. Songkran
19. Burning Man
20. Lollapalooza
21. Coachella
22. Comic-Con
23. The Notting Hill Carnival
24. Mardi Gras in New Orleans

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
