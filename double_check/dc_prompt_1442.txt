Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Emergency response systems that rely on circular gathering spaces as central coordination points

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Pentagon's Center Court emergency operations hub
2. Houston's NRG Center hurricane shelter command post
3. Chicago's Millennium Park emergency gathering plaza
4. Seattle Center's disaster coordination amphitheater

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. FEMA mobile command unit
6. Hospital emergency room
7. Fire station dispatch center
8. Police precinct headquarters
9. Red Cross supply warehouse
10. Emergency broadcast station
11. Coast Guard rescue station
12. Underground bunker complex
13. Rooftop helipad
14. Emergency evacuation route
15. City hall crisis center
16. 911 call center
17. Emergency shelter school gymnasium
18. Military base command post
19. Disaster relief staging area
20. Emergency vehicle depot
21. Search and rescue base camp
22. Emergency communications tower
23. Temporary field hospital
24. Emergency operations trailer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
