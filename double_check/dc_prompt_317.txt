Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices incorporating a reciprocating linear motion converted into rotary motion via a crank and connecting rod mechanism.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Steam locomotive
2. Internal combustion engine
3. Reciprocating saw
4. Hand-cranked pencil sharpener

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Wind turbine
6. Hydraulic press
7. Electric fan
8. Jet engine
9. Water wheel
10. Gearbox
11. Windmill
12. Electric motor
13. Propeller
14. Conveyor belt
15. Escalator
16. Elevator
17. Wind-up toy
18. Solar panel
19. Hydroelectric dam
20. Flywheel
21. Steam turbine
22. Clock pendulum
23. Electric generator
24. Wind sock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
