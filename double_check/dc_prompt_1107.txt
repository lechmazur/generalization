Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geometric patterns or structures in nature, art, or architecture that repeat infinitely without gaps or overlaps, often inspired by mathematical principles or natural forms.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The intricate design of a honeycomb
2. The repeating pattern of a Penrose tiling
3. The structure of a diatom's shell
4. The tessellation art of M.C. Escher

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The spiral pattern of a nautilus shell
6. The branching structure of a tree
7. The fractal nature of a Romanesco broccoli
8. The symmetry in a snowflake
9. The grid layout of a city
10. The repeating motif in a wallpaper design
11. The pattern of scales on a fish
12. The arrangement of leaves in a pinecone
13. The structure of a spider web
14. The pattern of a zebra's stripes
15. The design of a quilt
16. The layout of a chessboard
17. The pattern of a fingerprint
18. The structure of a coral reef
19. The repeating pattern in a fabric
20. The arrangement of petals in a sunflower
21. The design of a stained glass window
22. The pattern of a leopard's spots
23. The structure of a beehive
24. The layout of a garden maze

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
