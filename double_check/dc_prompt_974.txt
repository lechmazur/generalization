Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Activities or tools that require precise coordination and timing to achieve a successful outcome

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Playing a musical instrument in an orchestra
2. Performing a surgical operation
3. Executing a gymnastics routine
4. Completing a high-speed typing test

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Reading a book
6. Walking a dog
7. Cooking a meal
8. Watching a movie
9. Writing a letter
10. Gardening
11. Listening to music
12. Swimming
13. Painting a picture
14. Playing a board game
15. Shopping for groceries
16. Taking a nap
17. Attending a lecture
18. Riding a bicycle
19. Using a smartphone
20. Visiting a museum
21. Playing a video game
22. Doing laundry
23. Having a conversation
24. Traveling by train

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
