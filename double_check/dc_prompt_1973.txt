Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Elaborate annual cultural festivals involving traditional attire and dance, held to celebrate harvest or coming of age in specific ethnic groups.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Gerewol festival of the Wodaabe people in Niger, where men adorn elaborate makeup and costumes to perform dances and songs to attract potential mates.
2. The Sinulog Festival in Cebu, Philippines, a vibrant celebration honoring the Santo Ni√±o with street parades featuring participants in colorful tribal costumes performing traditional dances.
3. The Umhlanga, or Reed Dance, in Eswatini, where young women wear traditional attire and dance with reeds before the Queen Mother.
4. The Naadam Festival in Mongolia, featuring traditional wrestling, archery, and horse racing alongside vibrant cultural displays and throat singing performances.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weekly farmers market selling local produce.
6. A birthday party with a specific cultural theme.
7. A national holiday celebrating independence.
8. A religious ceremony involving specific rituals and attire.
9. A daily prayer ritual in a specific religious tradition.
10. A fashion show showcasing modern interpretations of traditional clothing.
11. A concert of traditional folk music.
12. A theatrical performance of a classic play.
13. A sporting event with traditional elements, like Sumo wrestling.
14. A wedding ceremony with traditional customs.
15. A graduation ceremony with academic regalia.
16. A community potluck dinner.
17. A historical reenactment of a significant event.
18. A street parade celebrating a local sports team's victory.
19. A carnival with rides and games.
20. A film festival showcasing international cinema.
21. An art exhibition featuring traditional crafts.
22. A conference on cultural preservation.
23. A family reunion with traditional dishes.
24. A memorial service honoring deceased community members.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
