Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects in nature that use specialized structures to capture and digest prey

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Venus flytrap
2. Pitcher plant
3. Sundew
4. Bladderwort

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Spider web
6. Praying mantis
7. Chameleon tongue
8. Eagle talons
9. Snake fangs
10. Beaver dam
11. Ant lion pit
12. Jellyfish tentacles
13. Owl beak
14. Frog tongue
15. Coral polyps
16. Woodpecker beak
17. Bat echolocation
18. Angler fish lure
19. Wolf teeth
20. Octopus tentacles
21. Scorpion claws
22. Crocodile jaws
23. Dragonfly wings
24. Shark teeth

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
