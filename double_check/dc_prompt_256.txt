Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): underwater geological formations that serve as habitats for unique species

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hydrothermal vent chimneys harboring tube worms and thermophilic bacteria
2. Deep-sea coral reefs providing shelter for diverse fish and invertebrate communities
3. Cold seeps with methane-rich sediments supporting chemosynthetic organisms like mussels and clams
4. Seamounts attracting pelagic fish and creating upwelling currents that enhance productivity

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Kelp forests
6. Mangrove forests
7. Estuaries
8. Rocky intertidal zones
9. Salt marshes
10. Coral reefs in shallow, sunlit waters
11. Abyssal plains
12. Oceanic trenches
13. Continental shelves
14. Seagrass beds
15. Open ocean
16. Arctic ice floes
17. Antarctic ice shelves
18. Sandy beaches
19. River deltas
20. Lake bottoms
21. Underground caves
22. Volcanic hot springs on land
23. Desert oases
24. Rainforests

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
