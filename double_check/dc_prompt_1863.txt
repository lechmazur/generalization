Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Urban phenomena that significantly alter local microclimates

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Heat island effect caused by extensive asphalt paving in city centers
2. Microclimate cooling from urban green roofs and vertical gardens
3. Wind patterns altered by skyscraper configurations in downtown areas
4. Increased humidity levels due to urban water features and fountains

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Traffic congestion leading to increased air pollution
6. Noise pollution from urban construction sites
7. Light pollution affecting urban night skies
8. Urban sprawl leading to loss of natural habitats
9. Increased crime rates in densely populated urban areas
10. Public transportation systems reducing car dependency
11. Gentrification causing shifts in neighborhood demographics
12. Urban farming initiatives promoting local food production
13. High-rise buildings providing more housing units
14. Street art enhancing the aesthetic appeal of urban spaces
15. Smart city technologies improving urban efficiency
16. Urban parks providing recreational spaces for residents
17. Homelessness as a social issue in urban environments
18. Urban renewal projects revitalizing old city districts
19. Public Wi-Fi networks increasing digital connectivity in cities
20. Food deserts in urban areas lacking grocery stores
21. Urban heatwaves exacerbated by global climate change
22. Cycling infrastructure promoting healthier lifestyles in cities
23. Urban planning policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions
24. Graffiti as a form of urban expression and vandalism

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
