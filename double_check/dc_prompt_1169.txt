Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): natural systems that exhibit self-sustaining cycles despite extreme environmental constraints

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a hydrothermal vent ecosystem in the deep ocean
2. a desert oasis supporting diverse flora and fauna
3. a lichen community thriving in Arctic tundra
4. a mangrove forest maintaining nutrient cycles in saline coastal waters

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a coral reef
6. a rainforest canopy
7. a freshwater lake
8. a savanna grassland
9. a tidal pool
10. a peat bog
11. a salt marsh
12. a deciduous forest
13. a prairie ecosystem
14. a kelp forest
15. a cloud forest
16. a wetland
17. a taiga biome
18. a river delta
19. a montane ecosystem
20. a steppe
21. a chaparral
22. a tundra
23. a desert
24. a polar ice cap

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
