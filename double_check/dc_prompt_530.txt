Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human-powered water transport that utilize a single, fixed-blade paddle and an open, undecked hull.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Adirondack guideboat
2. Au Sable river boat
3. Minnesota fishing boat
4. Grand Canyon dory

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. kayak
6. rowing shell
7. stand-up paddleboard
8. inflatable raft
9. catamaran
10. pontoon boat
11. jet ski
12. sailboat
13. canoe
14. gondola
15. dragon boat
16. outrigger canoe
17. pedal boat
18. surf ski
19. whitewater raft
20. skiff
21. punt
22. dugout canoe
23. racing scull
24. jon boat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
