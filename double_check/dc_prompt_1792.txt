Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects worn as personal adornments that symbolize access to restricted areas or knowledge

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a ceremonial key worn as a pendant
2. a medallion engraved with a secret society's emblem
3. a ring bearing an insignia of a restricted guild
4. a badge with a unique symbol granting access to a private archive

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wedding ring
6. a police officer's badge
7. a military dog tag
8. a graduation cap
9. a crown
10. a wristwatch
11. a locket with a family photo
12. a name tag
13. a friendship bracelet
14. a religious cross necklace
15. a sports team jersey
16. a school uniform
17. a pair of sunglasses
18. a scarf
19. a belt buckle
20. a pair of earrings
21. a tie clip
22. a charm bracelet
23. a lapel pin
24. a pair of gloves

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
