Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical or mythological events involving celestial phenomena that are documented in multiple cultural or religious traditions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Star of Bethlehem, observed at the time of Jesus's birth, is mentioned in Christian texts and has parallels in other ancient cultures.
2. The flood narrative, associated with a celestial event, appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Bible, and other ancient texts across different cultures.
3. The celestial event of the sun standing still, described in the Book of Joshua, has similarities in ancient Chinese and Mesoamerican records.
4. The myth of Phaethon's disastrous ride in the sun chariot, causing celestial chaos, is found in Greek mythology and has parallels in other mythologies.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Aurora Borealis, a natural celestial phenomenon, observed and documented in various cultures.
6. The lunar eclipse, a celestial event, noted in ancient Chinese, Babylonian, and Greek records.
7. The supernova of 1054 AD, observed and recorded by Chinese, Japanese, and Arab astronomers.
8. The myth of the Pleiades star cluster, which appears in Greek, Native American, and Aboriginal Australian stories.
9. The comet Halley, observed and documented in ancient Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European records.
10. The myth of Orion, the hunter, which appears in Greek, Egyptian, and Arabian mythologies.
11. The solar eclipse, a celestial event, noted in ancient Chinese, Mayan, and Greek records.
12. The myth of the Milky Way, which appears in Greek, Chinese, and Aboriginal Australian stories.
13. The celestial event of the sun's movement, described in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.
14. The myth of the constellation Cygnus, which appears in Greek, Native American, and Siberian stories.
15. The celestial event of the moon's phases, noted in ancient Chinese, Mayan, and Greek records.
16. The myth of the constellation Ursa Major, which appears in Greek, Native American, and Finnish stories.
17. The celestial event of the sun's path, described in the ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts.
18. The myth of the constellation Cassiopeia, which appears in Greek, African, and Polynesian stories.
19. The celestial event of the sun's rising and setting, noted in ancient Chinese, Mayan, and Greek records.
20. The myth of the constellation Pegasus, which appears in Greek, Arabian, and Native American stories.
21. The celestial event of the sun's annual cycle, described in the ancient Egyptian Book of Gates.
22. The myth of the constellation Draco, which appears in Greek, Chinese, and Native American stories.
23. The celestial event of the sun's daily journey, noted in ancient Egyptian, Mayan, and Greek records.
24. The myth of the constellation Lyra, which appears in Greek, Polynesian, and African stories.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
