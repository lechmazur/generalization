Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in performances that require specialized application techniques

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. stage makeup
2. rosin powder
3. theatrical spirit gum
4. liquid latex

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. microphone
6. spotlight
7. violin
8. ballet shoes
9. theater curtain
10. props table
11. costume rack
12. music stand
13. stage marker
14. fog machine
15. dance floor
16. theater mask
17. stage platform
18. lighting board
19. sound mixer
20. prop sword
21. stage rope
22. costume jewelry
23. stage backdrop
24. theater seat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
