Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient structures or sites that were rediscovered through mathematical analysis of historical texts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Helike
2. Machu Picchu
3. Troy
4. Pyramids of Giza (orientation)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Rosetta Stone
6. Antikythera Mechanism
7. Terracotta Army
8. Dead Sea Scrolls
9. Angkor Wat
10. Pompeii
11. Herculaneum
12. Valley of the Kings
13. Tutankhamun's tomb
14. Lascaux Cave paintings
15. Stonehenge
16. Nazca Lines
17. Great Wall of China
18. Chichen Itza
19. Teotihuacan
20. Colosseum
21. Hagia Sophia
22. Petra
23. Library of Alexandria (location)
24. Hanging Gardens of Babylon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
