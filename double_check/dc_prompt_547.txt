Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Handcrafted winter garments incorporating metallic thread or trim, originating from Hunan province, China.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a hand-knitted scarf with silver metallic thread woven into traditional Hunan patterns
2. a woolen hat adorned with gold metallic trim, featuring intricate embroidery from Hunan
3. a pair of mittens with copper-colored metallic accents, crafted using Hunan's traditional techniques
4. a winter cloak with metallic thread detailing, inspired by Hunan's cultural motifs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a cotton summer dress with floral embroidery
6. a leather jacket with studded decorations
7. a silk scarf with geometric patterns
8. a woolen sweater with no metallic elements
9. a beaded handbag from India
10. a quilted vest with polyester filling
11. a denim jacket with rhinestone embellishments
12. a cashmere shawl from Mongolia
13. a knitted blanket with no metallic thread
14. a pair of gloves made from synthetic materials
15. a traditional Japanese kimono
16. a feathered boa from the 1920s
17. a crocheted tablecloth with lace trim
18. a fur coat with no metallic elements
19. a handwoven basket from Africa
20. a velvet evening gown with sequins
21. a pair of leather boots with buckles
22. a cotton tote bag with screen-printed designs
23. a woolen poncho from Peru
24. a knitted scarf with no metallic thread or trim

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
