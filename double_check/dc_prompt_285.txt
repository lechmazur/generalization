Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to contain multiple smaller objects of a specific type, where the container's primary function is to facilitate the organized storage and retrieval of those smaller objects for a particular activity or purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a tackle box for fishing lures
2. a spice rack for cooking spices
3. a jewelry organizer for earrings and necklaces
4. a tool chest for mechanic's tools

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a backpack
6. a suitcase
7. a bookshelf
8. a filing cabinet
9. a refrigerator
10. a wardrobe
11. a drawer
12. a safe
13. a storage bin
14. a container
15. a box
16. a basket
17. a crate
18. a trunk
19. a pouch
20. a case
21. a bag
22. a wallet
23. a purse
24. a chest

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
