Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or entities that exist simultaneously in both physical and digital realms, facilitating interaction or exchange between these two dimensions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. QR code
2. credit card
3. fingerprint scanner
4. augmented reality marker

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. computer monitor
6. wireless router
7. cloud storage
8. email address
9. website URL
10. digital camera
11. smartphone app
12. virtual meeting room
13. social media profile
14. digital wallet
15. paper document
16. USB drive
17. digital signature
18. security badge
19. digital thermometer
20. electronic ticket
21. digital clock
22. barcode scanner
23. digital scale
24. electronic lock

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
