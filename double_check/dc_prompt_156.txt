Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that were initially dismissed as impossible but were completed ahead of their projected timeline and under budget

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket
2. Human Genome Project
3. ENIAC computer
4. Channel Tunnel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Wright brothers' first flight
6. Apollo 11 mission
7. Manhattan Project
8. Tesla Model S
9. iPhone development
10. Panama Canal
11. Brooklyn Bridge
12. Transcontinental Railroad
13. Internet development
14. GPS system
15. Hoover Dam
16. Large Hadron Collider
17. International Space Station
18. First heart transplant
19. Digital camera invention
20. First nuclear submarine
21. Development of penicillin
22. First artificial satellite
23. First mobile phone network
24. First successful cloning

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
