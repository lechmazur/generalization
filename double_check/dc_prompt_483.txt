Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures incorporating repurposed pre-Columbian Mesoamerican pyramid stones or their direct stylistic imitations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption in Oaxaca, Mexico
2. The Church of Santiago Ap√≥stol in Cholula, Mexico
3. The Convent of San Gabriel in Cholula, Mexico
4. The Church of San Juan Bautista in Coixtlahuaca, Mexico

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Pyramid of Giza
6. The Eiffel Tower
7. The Colosseum in Rome
8. The Parthenon in Athens
9. The Leaning Tower of Pisa
10. The Statue of Liberty
11. The Sydney Opera House
12. The Taj Mahal
13. The Burj Khalifa
14. The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona
15. The Golden Gate Bridge
16. The Tower of London
17. The Acropolis of Athens
18. The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul
19. The Kremlin in Moscow
20. The Forbidden City in Beijing
21. The Alhambra in Granada
22. The Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany
23. The Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro
24. The Palace of Versailles

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
