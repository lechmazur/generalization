Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that embody a transition from functionality to obsolescence, marked by a lingering aesthetic or emotional resonance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A rotary phone, still displayed in a mid-century modern home.
2. A cassette tape of a mixtape, tucked away in a dusty box of memories.
3. A vintage typewriter, now a decorative object on a writer's desk.
4. A decommissioned lighthouse, still standing sentinel against the sea.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A broken chair
6. A rusty bicycle
7. A faded photograph
8. A worn-out pair of shoes
9. A cracked teacup
10. A dried-up flower
11. An empty perfume bottle
12. A chipped plate
13. A torn map
14. A burned-out lightbulb
15. A discarded newspaper
16. An obsolete computer
17. A vintage car in perfect working order
18. A brand new, unused flip phone
19. A collection of antique tools still used regularly
20. A fully functional gramophone
21. A modern art sculpture made of discarded materials
22. A building demolished to make way for a new one
23. A forgotten toy in the attic
24. A historical artifact in a museum

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
