Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that enhance human perception of natural landscapes through real-time data overlay.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. An augmented reality app that overlays real-time geological information, including rock formations and mineral compositions, onto a mountain vista during a hike.
2. Smart glasses that display the names and characteristics of plants and animals encountered while walking through a forest, using image recognition and a connected database.
3. A drone-mounted thermal camera feed streamed to a mobile device, revealing heat signatures of wildlife in a grassland ecosystem during a safari.
4. A handheld device that uses sonar to map the underwater topography of a lake in real-time, visually displayed on the device's screen while kayaking.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weather app displaying the current temperature.
6. A GPS device showing a hiking trail map.
7. A nature documentary about the Amazon rainforest.
8. A pair of binoculars.
9. A digital camera with a telephoto lens.
10. A field guide to bird identification.
11. A website with information about national parks.
12. A satellite image of deforestation.
13. A soil testing kit for gardening.
14. A microscope for viewing microorganisms.
15. A telescope for observing stars.
16. A virtual reality experience of a coral reef.
17. A 3D model of a mountain range.
18. A time-lapse video of a flower blooming.
19. An audio recording of birdsong.
20. A painting of a landscape.
21. A poem about nature.
22. A fitness tracker that monitors heart rate during a hike.
23. A portable power bank for charging electronic devices outdoors.
24. A compass for navigation.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
