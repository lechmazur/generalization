Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that juxtapose elements of mortality with an underlying sense of hope or renewal.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A phoenix rising from ashes.
2. A barren winter landscape giving way to the first blooms of spring.
3. A eulogy that celebrates the life of the deceased while acknowledging the grief of their absence.
4. A decaying log in a forest, teeming with new life in the form of insects and fungi.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A brightly colored sunrise
6. A field of blooming sunflowers
7. A newborn baby
8. A graduation ceremony
9. A wedding celebration
10. A vibrant rainbow after a storm
11. A caterpillar transforming into a butterfly
12. A seed germinating
13. A wilting flower
14. A crumbling ancient ruin
15. A skeleton
16. A graveyard
17. A funeral procession
18. A dark, stormy night
19. A barren desert
20. A dried-up riverbed
21. A burning candle
22. An hourglass
23. A withered tree
24. A falling autumn leaf

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
