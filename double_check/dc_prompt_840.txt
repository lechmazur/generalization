Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena that result in significant atmospheric changes and influence global climate patterns

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Volcanic eruptions
2. Variations in solar radiation
3. El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
4. Milankovitch cycles

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Burning fossil fuels
6. Deforestation
7. Industrial emissions
8. Agricultural practices
9. Ocean currents
10. Cloud formation
11. Thunderstorms
12. Hurricanes
13. Tornadoes
14. Blizzards
15. Monsoons
16. Droughts
17. Floods
18. Wildfires
19. Earthquakes
20. Tsunamis
21. Landslides
22. Meteorite impacts
23. Thermohaline circulation
24. Atmospheric rivers

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
