Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects depicted in 19th-century illustrations that represent significant technological or natural events

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a steam locomotive
2. a telegraph machine
3. a hot air balloon
4. a comet

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a horse-drawn carriage
6. a medieval castle
7. a Roman aqueduct
8. a Renaissance painting
9. a Victorian dress
10. a Gothic cathedral
11. a spinning wheel
12. a pirate ship
13. a knight's armor
14. a windmill
15. a sundial
16. a quill pen
17. a printing press
18. a wooden cart
19. a candle
20. a blacksmith's forge
21. a plow
22. a loom
23. a waterwheel
24. a ship's anchor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
