Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geological formations or structures that serve as natural metaphors for emotional or psychological states, often used in literature or art to symbolize human experiences.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A chasm representing the gulf between two estranged lovers.
2. Shifting sands symbolizing the impermanence of memory.
3. An eroding cliff face reflecting the gradual decay of hope.
4. A dormant volcano embodying suppressed rage.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A geyser erupting.
6. A stalactite forming slowly over time.
7. The Grand Canyon.
8. A mountain range.
9. A river delta.
10. Smooth, polished river stones.
11. A field of wildflowers growing near a fault line.
12. A glacier carving a valley.
13. Layers of sedimentary rock.
14. A meteorite impact crater.
15. A cave painting depicting animals.
16. A fossil of an ancient creature.
17. A crystal geode.
18. A desert oasis.
19. An underground river.
20. A sinkhole suddenly appearing.
21. A landslide blocking a road.
22. The tectonic plates shifting.
23. A volcanic eruption causing widespread destruction.
24. An earthquake creating a tsunami.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
