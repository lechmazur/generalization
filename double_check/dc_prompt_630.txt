Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures incorporating spolia (repurposed building materials from older structures) visible from at least three distinct vantage points within a one-kilometer radius.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Arch of Janus in Rome
2. The Basilica of San Clemente in Rome
3. The Cathedral of Syracuse in Sicily
4. The Basilica of Saint-Denis in Paris

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Eiffel Tower in Paris
6. The Colosseum in Rome
7. The Parthenon in Athens
8. The Sydney Opera House in Sydney
9. The Leaning Tower of Pisa in Pisa
10. The Taj Mahal in Agra
11. The Great Wall of China
12. The Statue of Liberty in New York
13. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai
14. The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona
15. The Pyramids of Giza in Egypt
16. The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco
17. The Acropolis in Athens
18. The Tower of London in London
19. The Hagia Sophia in Istanbul
20. The Kremlin in Moscow
21. The Empire State Building in New York
22. The Pantheon in Rome
23. The Alhambra in Granada
24. The Forbidden City in Beijing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
