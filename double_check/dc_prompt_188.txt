Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures built by ancient civilizations for displaying human skulls

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Tzompantli of the Aztecs
2. The Skull Tower of Ni≈° in Serbia
3. The Capuchin Crypt in Rome
4. The Charnel House of Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ancient Egyptian pyramids
6. The Colosseum in Rome
7. Stonehenge in England
8. The Great Wall of China
9. The Parthenon in Greece
10. Machu Picchu in Peru
11. The Roman Aqueducts
12. The Mayan Temples
13. The Terracotta Army in China
14. The Moai statues of Easter Island
15. The Pantheon in Rome
16. The Acropolis in Athens
17. The Ziggurats of Mesopotamia
18. The Baths of Caracalla
19. The Library of Alexandria
20. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
21. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
22. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
23. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia
24. The Lighthouse of Alexandria

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
