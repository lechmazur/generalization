Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to hold burning fragrant materials that incorporate naturally occurring crystalline structures as a primary decorative or functional element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Himalayan salt lamp carved into a bowl shape, designed to hold incense cones.
2. An amethyst geode split and hollowed out to hold a tealight candle.
3. A selenite tower with a small depression carved in the top to hold loose incense.
4. A calcite cluster with a naturally formed cavity used as a container for burning fragrant herbs.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A ceramic incense burner.
6. A glass candle holder.
7. A metal oil diffuser.
8. A wooden smudge stick holder.
9. A Himalayan salt lamp.
10. An amethyst geode.
11. A selenite wand.
12. A calcite crystal.
13. A quartz point.
14. A rose quartz sphere.
15. A potpourri bowl.
16. An essential oil bottle.
17. A scented candle.
18. Incense sticks.
19. A smudge stick.
20. A diffuser bracelet.
21. A perfume bottle.
22. A flower vase.
23. A decorative rock.
24. A seashell.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
