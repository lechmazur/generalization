Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Islands in the Caribbean Sea named after European explorers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Columbus Island
2. Saba
3. St. Martin
4. St. Eustatius

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Jamaica
6. Puerto Rico
7. Hispaniola
8. Cuba
9. Barbados
10. Trinidad
11. Tobago
12. Montserrat
13. Antigua
14. Dominica
15. Grenada
16. St. Lucia
17. St. Vincent
18. St. Kitts
19. Nevis
20. Anguilla
21. Aruba
22. Bonaire
23. Cura√ßao
24. The Bahamas

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
