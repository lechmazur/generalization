Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects incorporating representations of the sun god Ra's journey through the underworld as a major decorative element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Greenfield Papyrus
2. The sarcophagus of Seti I
3. The Book of Gates on Horemheb's sarcophagus
4. The Amduat scroll of Thutmose III

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Sphinx at Giza
6. An ankh pendant
7. The Narmer Palette
8. A scarab amulet
9. The Rosetta Stone
10. A sistrum musical instrument
11. The Pyramidion of Amenemhat III
12. A bronze Ra statuette
13. The Temple of Luxor
14. A ceremonial sun disk
15. The Obelisk of Hatshepsut
16. A papyrus boat model
17. The Dendera Zodiac
18. A royal cartouche ring
19. The Book of the Dead papyrus
20. A ceremonial sun boat
21. The Abu Simbel temples
22. A djed pillar amulet
23. The Pyramid Texts
24. A solar barque model

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
