Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Electro-mechanical devices designed for automated, high-speed packaging of delicate agricultural produce.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a robotic arm with soft grippers for handling strawberries
2. a conveyor system with integrated sensors for sorting and packaging grapes
3. a vacuum-based machine for gently placing tomatoes into clamshell containers
4. a high-speed wrapping device for protecting delicate peaches in foam nets

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a manual fruit picker basket
6. a handheld vegetable peeler
7. a grain silo storage system
8. a tractor-mounted plow
9. a manual apple corer
10. a handheld pruning shear
11. a soil moisture sensor
12. a manual seed planter
13. a greenhouse irrigation system
14. a handheld fruit juicer
15. a manual egg carton filler
16. a handheld herb grinder
17. a manual cheese slicer
18. a handheld nutcracker
19. a manual coffee grinder
20. a handheld garlic press
21. a manual pasta maker
22. a handheld citrus squeezer
23. a manual bread slicer
24. a handheld spice grinder

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
