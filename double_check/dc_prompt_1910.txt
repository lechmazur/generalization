Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional hunting tools made from animal bones used by indigenous Arctic peoples

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Harpoon tip crafted from caribou bone
2. Arrowhead fashioned from walrus bone
3. Fishing spear point made from seal bone
4. Snow knife handle carved from whale bone

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stone-tipped spear used by ancient hunters
6. Wooden bow used in traditional archery
7. Modern hunting rifle
8. Metal fishhook used in contemporary fishing
9. Leather quiver for storing arrows
10. Flint knife used by early humans
11. Plastic snow shovel
12. Copper harpoon used in coastal fishing
13. Traditional Inuit kayak made from animal skins
14. Steel axe used for chopping wood
15. Bamboo blowgun used in tropical hunting
16. Silk fishing net used in freshwater fishing
17. Ceramic arrowhead used in ancient warfare
18. Rubber hunting boots
19. Canvas tent used for camping
20. Obsidian blade used by Mesoamerican cultures
21. Aluminum fishing rod
22. Polyester hunting jacket
23. Clay pot used for cooking
24. Iron spear used in medieval combat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
