Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Hand-powered tools designed for cracking or splitting a specific type of nut or seed commercially available in the 21st century.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. walnut cracker
2. pecan sheller
3. almond splitter
4. pistachio opener

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a hammer
6. a nutcracker for decorative purposes
7. a garlic press
8. a can opener
9. a pair of pliers
10. a screwdriver
11. a wrench
12. a cheese grater
13. a mortar and pestle
14. a vegetable peeler
15. a corkscrew
16. a potato masher
17. a rolling pin
18. a meat tenderizer
19. a citrus juicer
20. a pasta maker
21. a coffee grinder
22. a bread knife
23. a pizza cutter
24. a melon baller

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
