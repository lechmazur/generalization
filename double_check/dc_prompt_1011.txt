Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or practices that involve the deliberate arrangement of elements in a circular pattern for symbolic or functional purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A mandala
2. A crop circle
3. A zodiac wheel
4. A prayer wheel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A spiral staircase
6. A round table
7. A wheel of cheese
8. A circular saw
9. A ring
10. A clock face
11. A Ferris wheel
12. A doughnut
13. A hula hoop
14. A circular driveway
15. A rotary engine
16. A circular rug
17. A round shield
18. A circular mirror
19. A circular pond
20. A circular window
21. A circular stage
22. A circular garden
23. A circular track
24. A circular seating arrangement

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
