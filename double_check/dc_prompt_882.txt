Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or entities that have undergone significant restoration or preservation efforts to maintain their historical or cultural significance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Sistine Chapel ceiling
2. The historic sailing ship USS Constitution
3. Angkor Wat temple complex
4. The Dead Sea Scrolls

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A newly built replica of a Viking longship
6. A digital archive of historical photographs
7. A family heirloom passed down through generations
8. A protected wildlife sanctuary
9. A newly composed piece of music in a Baroque style
10. A recently discovered dinosaur fossil
11. A modern art installation inspired by ancient cave paintings
12. A biography of a historical figure
13. A traditional craft still practiced today
14. A language revitalization program
15. A historical reenactment
16. A collection of antique furniture
17. A newly constructed building in a historic district
18. A pristine natural landscape
19. An endangered species breeding program
20. A historical novel
21. A documentary film about a past event
22. A museum exhibit of ancient artifacts
23. A traditional recipe passed down through generations
24. A newly planted tree in a deforested area

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
