Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that symbolize transformation and are associated with the color blue.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. butterfly
2. ocean wave
3. blue moon
4. peacock feather

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. red rose
6. green leaf
7. yellow sun
8. white dove
9. black cat
10. golden coin
11. silver star
12. purple grape
13. orange pumpkin
14. pink flamingo
15. gray elephant
16. brown bear
17. red apple
18. green frog
19. yellow banana
20. white snowflake
21. black raven
22. golden sun
23. silver moon
24. purple plum

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
