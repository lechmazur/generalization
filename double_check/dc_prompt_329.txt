Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Electronic devices that use recurrent neural networks for real-time audio processing

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A device that processes live speech to generate real-time music composition
2. A system that analyzes and modifies audio input to create ambient soundscapes in real-time
3. An instrument that uses live audio input to dynamically alter its sound output through neural network processing
4. A tool that processes live vocal input to produce harmonized singing in real-time

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smartphone app that uses AI to enhance photo quality
6. A smartwatch that tracks heart rate using sensors
7. A laptop with a built-in AI assistant for voice commands
8. A gaming console that uses machine learning for character movement prediction
9. A home security system that uses facial recognition technology
10. A virtual reality headset that processes user movements in real-time
11. A drone that uses AI for autonomous flight path planning
12. A robot vacuum cleaner that uses machine learning to map a room
13. A fitness tracker that uses AI to suggest workout routines
14. A car with an AI system for adaptive cruise control
15. A smart speaker that uses AI to understand and respond to voice queries
16. A digital camera that uses AI to automatically adjust settings for optimal photos
17. A home automation system that uses AI to control lighting and temperature
18. A medical device that uses AI to analyze patient data for diagnostics
19. A music player that uses AI to recommend songs based on listening history
20. A translation device that uses AI to convert spoken language in real-time
21. A noise-canceling headphone that uses AI to adapt to different environments
22. A smart thermostat that uses AI to learn and adjust temperature preferences
23. A wearable device that uses AI to monitor sleep patterns
24. A traffic management system that uses AI to optimize traffic flow

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
