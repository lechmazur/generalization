Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Human-made structures incorporating a pendulum or pendulum-like oscillatory motion as a functional or artistic element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A grandfather clock with a swinging pendulum regulating its timekeeping mechanism.
2. A Foucault pendulum in a science museum demonstrating the Earth's rotation.
3. A metronome used by musicians to keep time, featuring a swinging arm.
4. An artwork installation in a modern art gallery where a large, colorful pendulum swings, creating patterns with sand on the floor.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A suspension bridge swaying in the wind.
6. A child's swing set in a playground.
7. A wrecking ball used in demolition.
8. A chandelier hanging from a ceiling.
9. A crane swinging a load on a construction site.
10. A hammock swaying between two trees.
11. A seesaw in a park.
12. A flagpole with a flag fluttering in the breeze.
13. A mobile hanging over a baby's crib.
14. A buoy bobbing in the water.
15. A wind chime with tubes that move in the wind.
16. A weather vane spinning on a rooftop.
17. A rotating restaurant atop a skyscraper.
18. A carnival ride that spins and swings.
19. A door swinging on its hinges.
20. A gate that oscillates when pushed.
21. A rocking chair moving back and forth.
22. A water wheel turning in a stream.
23. A gyroscope used in navigation systems.
24. A satellite dish adjusting its position.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
