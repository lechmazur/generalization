Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): natural or artificial systems that exhibit a bifurcation point where a single entity splits into two distinct pathways or branches, creating a divergence in flow, structure, or function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. river delta
2. decision tree
3. binary fission in bacteria
4. Y-shaped chromosome

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. solar system
6. mountain range
7. single-lane road
8. circle
9. single-threaded process
10. linear equation
11. monolithic architecture
12. straight river
13. single-cell organism
14. unbranched tree
15. solid cube
16. single path maze
17. monorail track
18. single wire circuit
19. unidirectional flow
20. single narrative storyline
21. one-way street
22. single-layer cake
23. linear timeline
24. single-threaded conversation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
