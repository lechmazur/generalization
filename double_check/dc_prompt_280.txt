Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Celestial events that have been depicted in science fiction films prior to their actual scientific observation or confirmation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Black holes depicted in the 1979 film *Disney's The Black Hole*
2. Wormholes used for interstellar travel in the 1968 film *2001: A Space Odyssey*
3. Binary sunset depicted in the 1977 film *Star Wars: A New Hope*
4. Supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy depicted in the 1977 film *Star Wars: A New Hope*

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A spacewalk depicted in *Gravity*
6. Alien invasion in *War of the Worlds*
7. Faster-than-light travel in *Star Trek*
8. Terraforming Mars in *Total Recall*
9. Artificial intelligence in *2001: A Space Odyssey*
10. Time travel in *Back to the Future*
11. Asteroid impacts in *Armageddon*
12. Space stations in *Elysium*
13. Colonization of other planets in *Avatar*
14. Genetic engineering in *Gattaca*
15. Cryosleep in *Passengers*
16. Robots in *I, Robot*
17. Virtual reality in *The Matrix*
18. Teleportation in *Star Trek*
19. Antimatter propulsion in *Star Trek*
20. Laser weapons in *Star Wars*
21. Force fields in *Star Wars*
22. Cybernetics in *RoboCop*
23. Mutants in *X-Men*
24. Exploration of Jupiter in *2010: The Year We Make Contact*

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
