Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or cultural works that prominently feature an unresolved tension between traditional mysticism and modern haute couture fashion

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A photography series depicting a cloistered nun draped in avant-garde, geometrically-shaped vestments, her face obscured by shadows, conveying a sense of both spiritual serenity and unsettling modernity.
2. A performance art piece where a shaman performs a ritualistic dance while wearing a deconstructed, iridescent gown, the movements blending ancient symbolism with contemporary fashion's theatricality.
3. A short film showcasing a young woman struggling to reconcile her family's traditional beliefs with her desire to become a fashion designer, culminating in a scene where she burns her sketches of modern garments in a ceremonial fire.
4. A novel about a renowned fashion house that draws inspiration from a forgotten mystical sect, their designs incorporating symbolic elements that evoke both reverence and unease in the wearers.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A documentary about the history of fashion.
6. A biography of a famous fashion designer.
7. A film about the impact of social media on fashion trends.
8. A book about the cultural significance of traditional clothing.
9. A photograph of a model wearing a traditional costume.
10. A painting of a religious icon.
11. A sculpture of a mythological figure.
12. A play about a family's religious beliefs.
13. A song about spiritual awakening.
14. A dance performance inspired by ancient rituals.
15. A fashion show featuring futuristic designs.
16. A magazine article about sustainable fashion.
17. A blog post about the latest fashion trends.
18. A social media campaign promoting a new clothing line.
19. A television show about the fashion industry.
20. A movie about a fashion designer's rise to fame.
21. A book about the psychology of fashion.
22. An exhibition of contemporary art inspired by nature.
23. A concert featuring traditional music.
24. A workshop on meditation and mindfulness.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
