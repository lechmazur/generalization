Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): mythological water spirits or deities associated with specific natural bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans, and possessing distinct cultural narratives or rituals tied to their origin or domain

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Rusalka
2. Yamuna
3. Vodyanoy
4. Nyai Roro Kidul

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Zeus
6. Poseidon
7. Mermaid
8. Kraken
9. Loch Ness Monster
10. Selkie
11. Leviathan
12. Sirens
13. Hydra
14. Charybdis
15. JÃ¶rmungandr
16. Neptune
17. Oceanus
18. Scylla
19. Atlanteans
20. Water Nymph
21. Undine
22. Sea Serpent
23. Water Elemental
24. Kelpie

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
