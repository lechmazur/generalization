Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical figures whose names have been used to designate species of plants or animals discovered in regions they were associated with.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Darwin's finch
2. Jeffersonia diphylla
3. Washingtonia filifera
4. Franklinia alatamaha

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Einstein's theory
6. Newton's apple
7. Lincoln's cabin
8. Shakespeare's sonnet
9. Beethoven's symphony
10. Curie's radium
11. Columbus's voyage
12. Napoleon's hat
13. Caesar's salad
14. Gandhi's philosophy
15. Cleopatra's needle
16. Alexander's empire
17. Galileo's telescope
18. Da Vinci's painting
19. Marie Antoinette's cake
20. Freud's theory
21. Hemingway's novel
22. Picasso's artwork
23. Wright brothers' airplane
24. Joan of Arc's armor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
