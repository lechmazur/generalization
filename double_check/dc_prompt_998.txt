Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies designed to mitigate natural disasters by utilizing real-time data from atmospheric or oceanic sensors

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a flood prediction system using river level sensors
2. a wildfire detection network with satellite-linked temperature sensors
3. a tsunami warning system powered by deep-sea pressure sensors
4. a hurricane tracking platform integrating atmospheric pressure and wind speed data

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a weather forecasting app for daily temperature updates
6. a GPS navigation system for hikers
7. a drone used for aerial photography
8. a smart thermostat for home energy efficiency
9. a water purification system for rural areas
10. a soil moisture sensor for agricultural irrigation
11. a traffic monitoring system using cameras
12. a wearable fitness tracker for heart rate monitoring
13. a solar panel array for renewable energy generation
14. a smartwatch with a built-in barometer
15. a home security system with motion detectors
16. a wind turbine for electricity production
17. a mobile app for earthquake preparedness tips
18. a satellite imaging system for urban planning
19. a smart irrigation system for gardens
20. a noise pollution monitoring device
21. a carbon dioxide sensor for indoor air quality
22. a drone used for crop spraying
23. a smart city lighting system
24. a mobile app for tracking air pollution levels

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
