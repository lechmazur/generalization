Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that combine opposing or contrasting states or qualities in a single, unified design or function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A reversible jacket, offering warmth on one side and water resistance on the other.
2. A noise-canceling headphone, simultaneously producing sound and eliminating external noise.
3. A regenerative braking system in a vehicle, converting kinetic energy into electrical energy during deceleration.
4. A surfactant molecule, possessing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A pencil and paper
6. A hammer and nail
7. A lock and key
8. A computer mouse and keyboard
9. A yin and yang symbol
10. A battery
11. A light bulb
12. A refrigerator
13. An airplane
14. A car
15. A bicycle
16. A boat
17. A train
18. A telescope
19. A microscope
20. A camera
21. A telephone
22. A television
23. A radio
24. A compass

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
