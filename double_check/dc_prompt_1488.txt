Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Wooden kitchen tools that have been traditionally used to make specific fermented foods across different cultures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kimchi pounding stick
2. Wooden sauerkraut stomper
3. Wooden miso paddle
4. Wooden kefir stirring spoon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Wooden salad bowl
6. Wooden pizza peel
7. Wooden cutting board
8. Wooden rolling pin
9. Wooden spoon for stirring soup
10. Wooden spatula for flipping pancakes
11. Wooden ladle for serving stew
12. Wooden mortar and pestle
13. Wooden chopsticks
14. Wooden butter churn
15. Wooden honey dipper
16. Wooden skewer for grilling
17. Wooden bread kneading board
18. Wooden cheese board
19. Wooden sushi rolling mat
20. Wooden coffee stirrer
21. Wooden ice cream scoop
22. Wooden egg cup
23. Wooden tea infuser
24. Wooden fruit basket

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
