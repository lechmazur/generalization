Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): cultural practices that involve rhythmic movement and are tied to specific geographic landmarks or natural formations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hula dancing at the base of Mauna Kea in Hawaii
2. Flamenco performances near the Alhambra in Spain
3. Traditional Maori haka performed on the shores of Lake Taupo in New Zealand
4. Capoeira practiced on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ballet performed in a theater
6. Jazz dance in a New York City studio
7. Irish step dancing in a community center
8. Samba parade during Carnival in a city street
9. Breakdancing in an urban park
10. Square dancing at a country fair
11. Waltz in a ballroom
12. Hip-hop dance in a music video
13. Tap dancing on a stage
14. Line dancing in a dance hall
15. Folk dancing at a cultural festival
16. Bharatanatyam in an Indian temple
17. Modern dance in a contemporary art museum
18. Polka at a wedding reception
19. Salsa dancing in a nightclub
20. Ballroom dancing in a competition
21. Scottish Highland dancing at a gathering
22. Odissi dance in a cultural center
23. Street dance in a public square
24. Traditional African dance in a village

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
