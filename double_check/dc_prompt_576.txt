Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical concepts or methods that are fundamental to statistical hypothesis testing but are rarely used directly in practical applications due to computational complexity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Likelihood Ratio Test
2. Permutation Test
3. Bootstrap Method
4. Bayesian Model Averaging

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. t-test
6. ANOVA
7. Chi-square test
8. Linear Regression
9. Logistic Regression
10. Correlation Coefficient
11. Confidence Interval
12. p-value
13. F-test
14. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
15. Spearman's Rank Correlation
16. Principal Component Analysis
17. Factor Analysis
18. Cluster Analysis
19. Time Series Analysis
20. Survival Analysis
21. Bayesian Inference
22. Monte Carlo Simulation
23. Markov Chain Monte Carlo
24. Decision Trees

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
