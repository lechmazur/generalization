Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that facilitate transformation through selective permeability or controlled passage of elements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. kidney
2. cell membrane
3. air filter
4. dialysis machine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. door
6. window
7. bridge
8. tunnel
9. hallway
10. escalator
11. elevator
12. highway
13. pipeline
14. staircase
15. gate
16. revolving door
17. turnstile
18. canal
19. conveyor belt
20. subway system
21. ventilation duct
22. corridor
23. walkway
24. drawbridge

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
