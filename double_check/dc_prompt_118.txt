Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional practices or techniques that involve circular or looping motions as a core element of their execution.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a potter's wheel
2. a hula hoop
3. a spinning top
4. a lasso

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a jump rope
6. a yo-yo
7. a windmill
8. a Ferris wheel
9. a merry-go-round
10. a spiral staircase
11. a corkscrew
12. a propeller
13. a record player
14. a clock's hands
15. a carousel
16. a drill bit
17. a roller coaster loop
18. a bicycle wheel
19. a spinning chair
20. a ceiling fan
21. a whirlpool
22. a tornado
23. a spiral galaxy
24. a phonograph record

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
