Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Events or inventions named after individuals who were not directly involved in their creation or founding.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Bunsen burner
2. Braille
3. Caesar salad
4. Graham cracker

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Newton's laws of motion
6. Einstein's theory of relativity
7. Morse code
8. Darwin's theory of evolution
9. Edison's light bulb
10. Galileo's telescope
11. Pasteurization
12. Fahrenheit scale
13. Voltaic pile
14. Dewey Decimal System
15. Fibonacci sequence
16. Pythagorean theorem
17. Kepler's laws of planetary motion
18. Archimedes' principle
19. Boyle's law
20. Ohm's law
21. Hubble Space Telescope
22. Curie's discovery of radioactivity
23. Mendel's laws of inheritance
24. Planck's constant

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
