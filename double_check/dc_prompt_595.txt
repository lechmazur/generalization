Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects crafted from or decorated with materials sourced from a specific, documented historical shipwreck.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A necklace made from silver coins recovered from the Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha shipwreck
2. A table crafted using wood salvaged from the Mary Rose shipwreck
3. A ring set with a gemstone found in the wreck of the Titanic
4. A sculpture incorporating metal from the SS Central America shipwreck

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting depicting a famous shipwreck
6. A model ship made from driftwood
7. A bracelet made from pearls sourced from the ocean
8. A vase crafted from recycled glass
9. A chair made from reclaimed barn wood
10. A clock with a face made from a salvaged ship's porthole
11. A sculpture made from coral
12. A brooch featuring a design of a historic ship
13. A sword made from steel sourced from a decommissioned battleship
14. A painting using pigments made from natural minerals
15. A necklace made from seashells
16. A ring crafted from volcanic rock
17. A table made from driftwood
18. A sculpture made from recycled metal
19. A pendant featuring a map of a famous shipwreck
20. A chair made from wood sourced from a historic building
21. A bracelet made from recycled plastic
22. A painting using watercolors made from natural dyes
23. A vase made from clay sourced from a historic site
24. A sculpture made from volcanic ash

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
