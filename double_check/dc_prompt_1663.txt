Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or artifacts traditionally used to signal the exact moment of transition between two distinct states or phases in ceremonial performances

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. hourglass
2. gong
3. bell
4. torch

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. candle
6. drum
7. flag
8. whistle
9. lantern
10. trumpet
11. clock
12. incense stick
13. conch shell
14. ribbon
15. feather
16. mask
17. staff
18. chalice
19. mirror
20. pendulum
21. scroll
22. stone
23. wand
24. book

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
