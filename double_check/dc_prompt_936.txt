Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical agreements or treaties that marked the end of a significant conflict and established a new political boundary or governance structure

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Treaty of Versailles
2. Treaty of Tordesillas
3. Peace of Westphalia
4. Camp David Accords

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Declaration of Independence
6. Magna Carta
7. United Nations Charter
8. Bill of Rights
9. Emancipation Proclamation
10. Kyoto Protocol
11. Geneva Convention
12. Constitution of the United States
13. Universal Declaration of Human Rights
14. Marshall Plan
15. North Atlantic Treaty
16. Paris Agreement
17. Helsinki Accords
18. Good Friday Agreement
19. NAFTA
20. Rome Statute
21. Maastricht Treaty
22. Schengen Agreement
23. Lisbon Treaty
24. Charter of the United Nations

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
