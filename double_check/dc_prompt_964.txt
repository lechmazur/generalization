Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that are traditionally carved for cultural or celebratory purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Totem poles
2. Jack-o'-lanterns
3. Ice sculptures
4. Gourd carvings

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Statues
6. Wooden furniture
7. Marble sculptures
8. Clay pottery
9. Engraved jewelry
10. Decorative tiles
11. Etched glass
12. Bas-relief art
13. Monuments
14. Memorial plaques
15. Wooden toys
16. Carved walking sticks
17. Decorative masks
18. Carved wooden bowls
19. Stone carvings
20. Carved wooden doors
21. Carved wooden figurines
22. Carved wooden frames
23. Carved wooden ornaments
24. Carved wooden signs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
