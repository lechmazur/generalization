Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographical features or locations named after a specific type of material or resource historically associated with their discovery, use, or significance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Copper River
2. Silver City
3. Gold Coast
4. Iron Mountain

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge
6. Woodstock
7. Silicon Valley
8. Coalville
9. Oil City
10. Glassboro
11. Granite Falls
12. Marble Canyon
13. Salt Lake City
14. Clay County
15. Sand Springs
16. Peachtree City
17. Cottonwood
18. Rubber City
19. Steel City
20. Brassfield
21. Tin City
22. Leadville
23. Zinc City
24. Aluminum City

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
