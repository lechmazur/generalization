Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that incorporate preserved botanical samples encased in transparent resin, intentionally shaped to resemble laboratory glassware.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Erlenmeyer flask paperweight containing pressed wildflowers in clear epoxy
2. Test tube pendant necklace with preserved moss trapped in crystal-clear resin
3. Beaker-shaped desk ornament with dried ferns suspended in polyester casting
4. Round-bottom flask bookend featuring preserved autumn leaves in transparent acrylic

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Glass terrarium with living succulents
6. Dried flower bookmark laminated in plastic
7. Traditional herbarium specimen mounted on paper
8. Microscope slide with plant cross-section
9. Resin jewelry containing pressed flowers
10. Empty laboratory beaker
11. Preserved insect in amber
12. Glass bottle containing dried botanicals
13. Plastic cube paperweight with artificial flowers
14. Scientific specimen jar with preserved plant
15. Decorative glass vial necklace
16. Resin coaster with embedded leaves
17. Laboratory flask filled with colored liquid
18. Pressed flower glass picture frame
19. Plant specimen in glycerin solution
20. Decorative glass apothecary jar
21. Resin sculpture containing dried flowers
22. Glass cylinder with preserved moss
23. Test tube spice rack
24. Botanical snow globe

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
