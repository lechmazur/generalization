Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures built primarily for leisure that are named after mythical sea creatures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Dragon's Splash Water Park
2. Mermaid's Cove Amusement Park
3. Neptune's Kingdom Theme Park
4. Siren's Song Resort

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Eiffel Tower
6. Golden Gate Bridge
7. Statue of Liberty
8. Great Wall of China
9. Sydney Opera House
10. Colosseum
11. Empire State Building
12. Leaning Tower of Pisa
13. Pyramids of Giza
14. Big Ben
15. Burj Khalifa
16. Christ the Redeemer
17. Taj Mahal
18. Petronas Towers
19. Parthenon
20. St. Basil's Cathedral
21. Machu Picchu
22. Stonehenge
23. Angkor Wat
24. Notre-Dame Cathedral

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
