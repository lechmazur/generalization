Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures that incorporate natural elements to create self-sustaining energy systems in extreme environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A desert research facility with integrated sand-filtering solar panels and thermal storage systems
2. An arctic station utilizing geothermal vents and ice-melt collection for power generation
3. A mountain observatory powered by wind turbines and rainwater harvesting systems
4. A deep-sea research lab using tidal forces and thermal gradients for energy production

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional windmill
6. A greenhouse
7. A solar farm
8. A hydroelectric dam
9. A geothermal power plant
10. A wave energy converter
11. A bamboo treehouse
12. A living wall system
13. A rain garden
14. A green roof installation
15. A natural ventilation system
16. A biomass heating facility
17. A passive solar house
18. An earth-sheltered building
19. A composting facility
20. A natural swimming pool
21. A rainwater collection tank
22. A solar water heater
23. A wind farm
24. A tidal barrier

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
