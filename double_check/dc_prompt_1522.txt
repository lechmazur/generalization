Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient artifacts or relics that were discovered underwater and are directly associated with a known historical ruler

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Antikythera Mechanism, discovered off the coast of Greece, associated with the Roman Republic era under Julius Caesar
2. The Marsala Punic Ship, found near Sicily, linked to the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca
3. The Bremen Cog, a medieval ship discovered in Germany, connected to King Valdemar IV of Denmark
4. The Mary Rose, Henry VIII's flagship, discovered in the Solent, England

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ancient pottery found in a terrestrial archaeological site
6. A shipwreck from the 18th century with no known historical figure association
7. A Viking sword discovered on land
8. Ancient coins found in a river, not linked to a specific ruler
9. A medieval manuscript discovered in a monastery
10. A statue of a pharaoh found in a desert
11. A Roman mosaic unearthed in a city
12. A Neolithic tool found in a cave
13. Ancient jewelry discovered in a tomb
14. A Byzantine icon found in a church
15. A Celtic brooch found in a field
16. An Egyptian papyrus discovered in a library
17. A Maya stela found in a jungle
18. A Chinese bronze vessel found in a palace
19. An Incan artifact found in a mountain
20. A Greek amphora found in a museum collection
21. A medieval tapestry found in a castle
22. An ancient tool found in an excavation site
23. A Roman aqueduct discovered on land
24. An ancient wall painting found in a ruin

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
