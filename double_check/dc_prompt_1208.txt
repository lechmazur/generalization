Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or tools that require precise, sequential actions to unlock or access their full functionality, often involving a combination of physical manipulation and mental focus.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A combination lock
2. A multi-step chemical reaction in a lab setting
3. A complex piece of origami
4. Playing a specific melody on a musical instrument

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A door with a simple key lock
6. A light switch
7. A car ignition
8. A television remote
9. A zipper
10. A button
11. A shoelace
12. A bicycle
13. A computer keyboard
14. A smartphone touchscreen
15. A Rubik's Cube
16. A jigsaw puzzle
17. A safe
18. A padlock
19. A car
20. A recipe
21. A set of instructions for assembling furniture
22. A computer program
23. A mathematical equation
24. A piece of software

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
