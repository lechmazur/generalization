Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects manufactured in factories that possess unique, non-mechanical abilities.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A teddy bear that can teleport short distances.
2. A plastic doll that can predict the weather with surprising accuracy.
3. A mass-produced ceramic mug that refills itself with coffee.
4. A factory-made glass marble that can induce vivid dreams in its holder.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A robot vacuum cleaner.
6. A self-driving car.
7. A smartphone.
8. A 3D printer.
9. A microwave oven.
10. A washing machine.
11. A refrigerator.
12. A television.
13. A computer.
14. A drone.
15. A toy car.
16. A wind-up toy.
17. A plastic action figure.
18. A board game.
19. A deck of cards.
20. A book.
21. A painting.
22. A sculpture.
23. A musical instrument.
24. A piece of clothing.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
