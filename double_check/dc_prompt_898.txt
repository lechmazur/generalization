Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or systems designed by ancient civilizations to manage or manipulate natural resources for urban development

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Roman aqueducts
2. Incan terrace farming
3. Mesopotamian irrigation canals
4. Ancient Egyptian nilometers

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge
6. Greek amphitheaters
7. Roman Colosseum
8. Great Wall of China
9. Aztec pyramids
10. Viking longships
11. Babylonian ziggurats
12. Greek Parthenon
13. Roman roads
14. Chinese pagodas
15. Egyptian pyramids
16. Hanging Gardens of Babylon
17. Roman baths
18. Greek temples
19. Incan roads
20. Persian qanats
21. Maori meeting houses
22. Japanese Shinto shrines
23. Roman amphitheaters
24. Byzantine churches

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
