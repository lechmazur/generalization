Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Inventions that were initially ridiculed but later became essential in aviation history

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Wright brothers' airplane
2. Jet engine
3. Autopilot system
4. Helicopter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Concorde
6. Space Shuttle
7. Hot air balloon
8. Zeppelin
9. Stealth technology
10. Supersonic flight
11. Drone technology
12. Black box recorder
13. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL)
14. Fly-by-wire systems
15. Air traffic control radar
16. Inflight entertainment systems
17. Passenger jet
18. Airbus A380
19. Conventional landing gear
20. Weather radar
21. Aircraft carrier
22. Glider
23. Parachute
24. Flight simulator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
