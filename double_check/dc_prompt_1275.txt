Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or cultural practices that involve collaborative creation or communal participation, where the final product or experience is shaped by the collective input of multiple individuals.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A community mural painted by neighborhood residents
2. An improvisational jazz performance
3. A quilting circle's collective blanket
4. A flash mob dance performance

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting in an art gallery
6. A sculpture garden
7. A concert hall performance
8. A museum exhibit
9. A solo violin recital
10. A photography exhibition
11. A ballet performance
12. An art installation
13. A poetry reading
14. A theatrical monologue
15. A ceramic vase
16. A street performer's act
17. A painted portrait
18. A documentary film
19. A novel
20. A recorded album
21. A fashion show
22. A stand-up comedy routine
23. A magic show
24. A circus performance

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
