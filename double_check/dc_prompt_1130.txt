Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional textiles or crafts that incorporate natural materials and patterns derived from local ecosystems or cultural symbolism.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hand-woven baskets made from river reeds and dyed with local plant extracts
2. Embroidered shawls featuring motifs inspired by regional flora and fauna
3. Tapestries crafted from wool and adorned with patterns reflecting indigenous myths
4. Cloth dyed using traditional methods with natural indigo and adorned with geometric designs inspired by the local landscape

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Modern fabric printed with abstract designs
6. Plastic woven baskets
7. Machine-made rugs with synthetic fibers
8. Leather goods dyed with chemical dyes
9. Ceramic pottery with modern geometric patterns
10. Silk scarves with digitally printed images
11. Wooden carvings with no specific cultural symbolism
12. Metal jewelry with contemporary designs
13. Paintings on canvas using acrylic paints
14. Handbags made from synthetic materials
15. Clothing with logos and brand names
16. Industrial-made furniture with no natural materials
17. Photographs printed on synthetic paper
18. Electronic devices with decorative casings
19. Books with covers made from recycled plastics
20. Kitchen utensils made from stainless steel
21. Automobiles with custom paint jobs
22. Plastic toys with vibrant colors
23. Artificial flowers made from silk
24. Wallpaper with generic floral patterns

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
