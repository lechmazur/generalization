Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations from the mid-20th century that significantly advanced computational methods and were pioneered by women.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ada Lovelace's work on the Analytical Engine
2. Grace Hopper's development of the COBOL programming language
3. Katherine Johnson's calculations for NASA's space missions
4. Jean Sammet's contributions to the development of FORMAC

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Alan Turing's development of the Turing machine
6. Steve Jobs' role in the creation of the Apple Macintosh
7. Bill Gates' development of Microsoft Windows
8. John von Neumann's architecture for computers
9. Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the World Wide Web
10. Elon Musk's advancements in electric vehicles
11. Thomas Edison's invention of the phonograph
12. Mark Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook
13. Sergey Brin's work on Google search algorithms
14. Jeff Bezos' founding of Amazon
15. Gordon Moore's formulation of Moore's Law
16. Linus Torvalds' development of the Linux kernel
17. Vint Cerf's contributions to the development of the Internet
18. Jack Kilby's invention of the integrated circuit
19. Claude Shannon's information theory
20. Hedy Lamarr's frequency-hopping spread spectrum
21. Marissa Mayer's leadership at Yahoo
22. Sheryl Sandberg's role at Facebook
23. Margaret Hamilton's software engineering for Apollo missions
24. Rosalind Franklin's work on DNA structure

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
