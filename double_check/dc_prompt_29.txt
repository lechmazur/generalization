Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer electronics that utilize a mesh network topology for communication and control, released after 2015.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Amazon eero Pro 6E router
2. Google Nest Wifi Pro
3. ASUS ZenWiFi AX
4. Linksys Velop MX4200

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Philips Hue Bridge
6. Ring Video Doorbell
7. Apple AirPort Extreme
8. Sonos One Speaker
9. Netgear Nighthawk R7000
10. Samsung SmartThings Hub
11. TP-Link Archer C7
12. Belkin WeMo Switch
13. Nest Learning Thermostat
14. Echo Dot
15. D-Link DIR-890L
16. Roku Streaming Stick
17. Chromecast Ultra
18. Arlo Pro 3 Camera
19. Ubiquiti UniFi AP
20. Apple TV 4K
21. Ecobee SmartThermostat
22. Logitech Harmony Hub
23. Yale Smart Lock
24. Wink Hub 2

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
