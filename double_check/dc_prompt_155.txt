Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural disasters that directly led to the creation of specific scientific measurement scales or units

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake led to the development of the first modern seismological scale, the Rossi-Forel scale.
2. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake prompted the creation of the Richter magnitude scale for quantifying earthquake size.
3. The eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 led to the development of the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) to measure the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions.
4. The 1900 Galveston hurricane spurred the development of the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) for categorizing hurricane intensity.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the barometer
6. The development of the Celsius temperature scale
7. The discovery of gravity
8. The study of plate tectonics
9. The development of weather forecasting models
10. The use of Doppler radar in meteorology
11. The study of tsunami formation
12. The development of earthquake early warning systems
13. The study of volcanic gases
14. The measurement of sea level rise
15. The study of climate change
16. The development of flood control measures
17. The use of satellites for Earth observation
18. The study of atmospheric pressure
19. The measurement of wind speed
20. The study of cloud formation
21. The measurement of rainfall
22. The study of drought conditions
23. The development of fire suppression techniques
24. The study of landslide dynamics

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
