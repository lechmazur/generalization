Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures that utilize layered or stacked materials to enhance durability, insulation, or structural integrity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. plywood
2. winter coat
3. bulletproof vest
4. thermos flask

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. brick wall
6. steel beam
7. glass window
8. wooden table
9. concrete slab
10. plastic container
11. metal fence
12. ceramic tile
13. rubber mat
14. copper pipe
15. stone pillar
16. aluminum can
17. cardboard box
18. marble countertop
19. vinyl siding
20. bamboo floor
21. iron gate
22. plastic bottle
23. wooden door
24. steel cabinet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
