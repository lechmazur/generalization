Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that depict a legendary creature interacting with a miniature representation of a real-world historical sport or game

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A dragon figurine playing chess with a miniature knight
2. A unicorn statue holding a tiny cricket bat
3. A griffin sculpture interacting with a small-scale model of a Roman gladiator arena
4. A mermaid carving with a miniature Viking ship used in a game

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A dragon figurine
6. A unicorn statue
7. A griffin sculpture
8. A mermaid carving
9. A chess set with mythical creatures
10. A miniature knight
11. A tiny cricket bat
12. A small-scale model of a Roman gladiator arena
13. A miniature Viking ship
14. A dragon playing with a soccer ball
15. A unicorn with a basketball
16. A griffin holding a tennis racket
17. A mermaid with a volleyball
18. A dragon and a knight
19. A unicorn and a cricket player
20. A griffin and a gladiator
21. A mermaid and a Viking
22. A dragon in a chess game
23. A unicorn in a cricket match
24. A griffin in a gladiator fight

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
