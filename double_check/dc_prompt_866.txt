Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural phenomena or events that have been historically interpreted as acts of divine intervention or miracles in religious texts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the parting of the Red Sea
2. the raining of manna from heaven
3. the stopping of the sun in the sky
4. the burning bush that was not consumed

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a solar eclipse
6. a volcanic eruption
7. a rainbow after a storm
8. a meteor shower
9. a tsunami
10. a tornado
11. a lunar eclipse
12. a thunderstorm
13. a hurricane
14. a flood
15. a drought
16. a comet passing by Earth
17. a lightning strike
18. a sandstorm
19. a blizzard
20. an earthquake
21. a hailstorm
22. a solar flare
23. a foggy morning
24. a double rainbow

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
