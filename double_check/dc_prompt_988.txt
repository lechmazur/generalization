Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Characters or personas that blend elements of comedy and mythology to critique modern society

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A trickster god who disguises themselves as a stand-up comedian to mock corporate greed.
2. A satirical superhero inspired by ancient myths, using absurd powers to expose societal hypocrisy.
3. A mythological creature reimagined as a social media influencer, parodying modern vanity and obsession with fame.
4. A comedic demigod who works in a fast-food restaurant, using their divine wit to critique consumer culture.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A tragic hero from Greek mythology who struggles with fate.
6. A modern-day detective solving crimes inspired by ancient myths.
7. A historical figure reimagined as a fantasy warrior.
8. A mythological creature used as a mascot for a sports team.
9. A comedic character in a sitcom with no ties to mythology.
10. A mythical beast that serves as a guardian in a fantasy novel.
11. A satirical cartoon character critiquing politics without mythological elements.
12. A modern retelling of a myth with no comedic elements.
13. A mythological figure portrayed as a villain in a serious drama.
14. A comedic duo inspired by folklore but not critiquing society.
15. A mythical hero who saves the world in an epic adventure.
16. A parody of a historical event with no mythological references.
17. A mythological creature used as a symbol in a serious poem.
18. A comedic character in a fantasy setting with no societal critique.
19. A modern-day adaptation of a myth focused on romance.
20. A satirical play about modern life with no mythological characters.
21. A mythological figure reimagined as a scientist in a serious story.
22. A comedic alien character critiquing human behavior without mythological ties.
23. A mythical artifact used as a plot device in a thriller.
24. A parody of a fairy tale with no connection to mythology.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
