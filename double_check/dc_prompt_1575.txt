Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Religious or spiritual structures that incorporate bells positioned above eye level and are meant to be circumambulated by worshippers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Tibetan chorten with prayer bells suspended from its spire, designed for clockwise circumambulation.
2. A Balinese Hindu temple with a multi-tiered meru tower adorned with bells, around which devotees process during ceremonies.
3. A Nepalese stupa featuring a harmika with bells that ring in the wind as pilgrims walk around its base.
4. A Bhutanese dzong fortress monastery with a central utse tower topped by a gilded canopy and bells, encircled by a courtyard for ritual processions.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A church steeple with bells.
6. A carillon tower.
7. A Shinto shrine gate (torii).
8. A Buddhist prayer wheel.
9. A Muslim minaret.
10. A Jewish synagogue with an eternal light.
11. A Christian monastery bell tower.
12. A Hindu temple gopuram.
13. A Sikh gurdwara with a Nishan Sahib flagpole.
14. A Jain temple with a shikhara.
15. A Taoist temple with a drum tower.
16. A Native American medicine wheel.
17. A Stonehenge.
18. A Mayan pyramid.
19. An Egyptian pyramid.
20. A Roman temple.
21. A Greek temple.
22. A ziggurat.
23. A cairn.
24. A mosque dome.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
