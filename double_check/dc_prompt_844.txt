Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that integrate probabilistic decision-making with cultural safety practices in high-risk environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A nuclear power plant's emergency response protocol that combines Bayesian risk assessment with indigenous land acknowledgment practices
2. An air traffic control system that integrates weather probability models with multilingual communication standards
3. A hospital triage algorithm that weighs statistical outcomes while incorporating diverse cultural healing practices
4. An offshore drilling platform's safety management system that combines predictive analytics with local maritime customs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A basic hospital checklist system
6. Statistical quality control in manufacturing
7. Traditional indigenous healing practices
8. Standard operating procedures for firefighters
9. Cultural sensitivity training programs
10. Risk assessment matrices
11. Emergency evacuation protocols
12. Machine learning algorithms for prediction
13. Workplace diversity initiatives
14. Safety compliance software
15. Cross-cultural communication guidelines
16. Probabilistic risk analysis tools
17. Cultural competency frameworks
18. Decision support systems
19. Environmental impact assessments
20. Quality management systems
21. Hazard identification procedures
22. Community engagement protocols
23. Statistical process control methods
24. Traditional safety management systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
