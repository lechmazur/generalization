Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Paintings from 1870-1890 that prominently feature a single figure viewed from behind while they look out a window

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Portrait of a Woman at a Window by Gustave Caillebotte (1880)
2. Woman at a Window by Mary Cassatt (1880)
3. Young Woman at a Window by Berthe Morisot (1879)
4. Figure at a Window by Edgar Degas (1876)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Painting of a group of people at a window from the 1880s
6. Single figure viewed from the front looking out a window, painted in 1875
7. Landscape painting from 1880 with a small figure in the distance at a window
8. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a mirror, painted in 1885
9. Painting of a single figure at a window from the 1900s
10. Single figure viewed from the side looking out a window, painted in 1870
11. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a door, painted in 1880
12. Painting of a single figure at a window from the 1860s
13. Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1910
14. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a painting, painted in 1880
15. Painting of a single figure at a window from the 1850s
16. Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1865
17. Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1895
18. Painting of a single figure at a window from the 1920s
19. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a balcony, painted in 1880
20. Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1860
21. Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1900
22. Painting of a single figure at a window from the 1840s
23. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a garden, painted in 1880
24. Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1850

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
