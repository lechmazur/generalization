Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used as improvised musical instruments in reggae music

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. empty glass bottles
2. metal trash can lids
3. wooden crates
4. metal graters

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. tambourine
6. bongos
7. steel drums
8. maracas
9. plastic buckets
10. aluminum cans
11. coconut shells
12. wooden spoons
13. tin whistles
14. djembe drums
15. washboard
16. glass xylophone
17. rain stick
18. bamboo flute
19. clay pots
20. metal pipes
21. cardboard boxes
22. plastic cups
23. metal chains
24. PVC pipes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
