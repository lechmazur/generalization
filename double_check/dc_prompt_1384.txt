Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Temporary decorative elements that are deliberately designed to be gradually destroyed or degraded through normal use of the product they adorn

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a sand mandala
2. a biodegradable confetti cannon
3. a chalk sidewalk mural
4. a paper lantern designed to disintegrate in rain

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a permanent tattoo
6. a ceramic vase
7. a metal sculpture
8. a glass window
9. a wooden table
10. a plastic water bottle
11. a rubber tire
12. a concrete statue
13. a fabric curtain
14. a leather jacket
15. a steel bridge
16. a brick wall
17. a marble countertop
18. a silicone phone case
19. a vinyl record
20. a cardboard box
21. a paper napkin
22. a wax candle
23. a foam mattress
24. a nylon rope

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
