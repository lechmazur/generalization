Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural features specifically designed to reveal hidden internal building components for educational or aesthetic purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A glass-walled elevator shaft that displays the inner workings of the elevator system.
2. A transparent section of a building's facade that showcases the HVAC system's ductwork.
3. An exposed cross-section of a building's wall, revealing the layers of insulation and structural components.
4. A cutaway portion of a roof that displays the underlying truss system and waterproofing layers.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A building with large windows that allow natural light to enter.
6. An open-concept office space that promotes collaboration.
7. A museum exhibit that uses interactive displays to educate visitors.
8. A building with a green roof designed to improve energy efficiency.
9. A skyscraper with a unique exterior design that serves as a landmark.
10. A historic building that has been restored to preserve its original features.
11. A building with a lobby that features artwork by local artists.
12. A structure with a retractable roof for hosting outdoor events.
13. A building with a geothermal heating and cooling system.
14. A library with a dedicated space for children's activities.
15. A building with a rainwater harvesting system for sustainability.
16. A structure with a cantilevered design that creates a dramatic entrance.
17. A building with a rooftop garden that provides a space for relaxation.
18. A structure with a facade made of recycled materials to promote eco-friendliness.
19. A building with a central atrium that serves as a gathering space.
20. A structure with a modular design that allows for future expansion.
21. A building with a facade that incorporates solar panels for energy generation.
22. A structure with a unique shape that optimizes natural ventilation.
23. A building with a dedicated space for art exhibitions and performances.
24. A structure with a facade that changes color based on the time of day.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
