Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to be worn on the human body that incorporate a functional timekeeping mechanism.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a wristwatch with a leather strap
2. a pocket watch with a chain
3. a smartwatch with fitness tracking
4. a pendant watch on a necklace

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a decorative brooch
6. a fitness tracker without time display
7. a smartphone with a clock app
8. a wall clock
9. a desk clock
10. a car dashboard clock
11. a kitchen timer
12. a stopwatch
13. a sundial
14. a grandfather clock
15. a digital alarm clock
16. a timekeeping app on a tablet
17. a necklace with a decorative pendant
18. a bracelet without any functional mechanism
19. a ring with a decorative stone
20. a belt with a buckle
21. a hat with a logo
22. a pair of sunglasses
23. a scarf
24. a pair of earrings

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
