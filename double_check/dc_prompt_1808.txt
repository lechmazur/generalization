Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Free and open-source software tools specifically designed for managing aquaculture operations across different geographical locations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. AquaManager
2. FishFarmOS
3. OpenAqua
4. AquaTrack

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Microsoft Excel
6. Google Sheets
7. QuickBooks
8. Salesforce
9. Trello
10. Slack
11. Zoom
12. Dropbox
13. GitHub
14. WordPress
15. Moodle
16. Blender
17. GIMP
18. Audacity
19. LibreOffice
20. VLC Media Player
21. Firefox
22. Thunderbird
23. OpenStreetMap
24. Krita

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
