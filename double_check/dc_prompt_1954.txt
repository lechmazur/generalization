Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Items used for marking pages in books that are made from a single piece of fabric

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A silk ribbon bookmark
2. A cotton fabric page marker
3. A linen bookmark strip
4. A velvet fabric page indicator

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A paper bookmark
6. A plastic bookmark
7. A metal bookmark
8. A wooden bookmark
9. A leather bookmark
10. A magnetic bookmark
11. A clip-on bookmark
12. A sticky note used as a bookmark
13. A corner page marker
14. A bookmark with tassels
15. A beaded bookmark
16. A photo bookmark
17. A laminated bookmark
18. A fabric bookmark with embroidery
19. A fabric bookmark with multiple pieces sewn together
20. A fabric bookmark with a printed design
21. A fabric bookmark with a metal clasp
22. A fabric bookmark with a decorative charm
23. A fabric bookmark with a loop for a pen
24. A fabric bookmark with a built-in highlighter

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
