Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Deliberately arranged natural materials used to create temporary patterns viewed from above in spiritual or religious practices

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a mandala made from colored sand
2. a labyrinth outlined with stones
3. a spiral pattern of leaves on the ground
4. a circle of flowers arranged on a forest floor

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a painting of a landscape
6. a sculpture made from driftwood
7. a woven basket
8. a stained glass window
9. a carved wooden totem pole
10. a mural on a church wall
11. a stone altar
12. a clay pot with intricate designs
13. a tapestry depicting a religious scene
14. a bonsai tree
15. a rock garden
16. a ceremonial drum
17. a prayer rug
18. a candle arrangement on an altar
19. a religious text
20. a string of prayer beads
21. a ceremonial robe
22. a painted icon
23. a mosaic floor
24. a carved stone statue

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
