Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that involve the intentional distortion or manipulation of spatial relationships to achieve a specific functional or artistic purpose.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Forced perspective photography
2. Anamorphic art
3. Trompe-l'Å“il painting
4. Fish-eye lens

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A photograph taken with a telephoto lens
6. A portrait painting
7. A still life painting
8. A landscape painting
9. A wide-angle lens
10. A macro lens
11. A zoom lens
12. A blueprint
13. A map
14. A globe
15. A topographical map
16. A satellite image
17. A hologram
18. Virtual Reality
19. Augmented Reality
20. A kaleidoscope
21. A mirage
22. A magic trick involving illusion
23. A distorted reflection in a funhouse mirror
24. A cubist painting

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
