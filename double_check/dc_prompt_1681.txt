Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural features or structures that create rainbow-like light effects through the natural interaction of sunlight with their materials or design

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Dichroic glass installations
2. Prismatic skylights
3. Faceted crystal chandeliers
4. Iridescent tiled facades

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stained glass windows
6. Rainbows
7. Sunsets
8. Northern Lights
9. Holograms
10. Soap bubbles
11. Oil slicks on water
12. CD reflections
13. Diamond
14. Opal
15. LED light shows
16. Projector displays
17. Kaleidoscopes
18. Light diffraction gratings
19. Fish scales
20. Butterfly wings
21. Peacock feathers
22. Chameleon skin
23. Mood rings
24. Prism glasses

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
