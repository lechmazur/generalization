Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to be held in one hand and manipulated with the fingers of that same hand, featuring a mechanism that produces a rapid, repetitive clicking sound when activated.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A fidget spinner with a built-in clicker mechanism
2. A pen with a retractable tip that clicks when extended or retracted
3. A handheld clicker counter used for keeping score or counting
4. A stress relief toy with multiple buttons that produce clicking sounds when pressed

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smartphone
6. A television remote control
7. A computer mouse
8. A musical instrument like a tambourine
9. A yo-yo
10. A keychain
11. A wristwatch
12. A flashlight
13. A handheld gaming console
14. A camera
15. A pair of scissors
16. A stapler
17. A bottle opener
18. A lighter
19. A can opener
20. A tape measure
21. A calculator
22. A handheld fan
23. A magnifying glass
24. A compass

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
