Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ephemeral large-scale art installations primarily composed of compacted snow or ice, exhibited in public spaces for a limited time.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The 50-foot-tall Winter Palace created for the 2018 St. Paul Winter Carnival
2. The Snowking's Snow Castle built on Great Slave Lake in Yellowknife
3. The Ice Symphony installation at the 2020 Harbin International Ice Festival
4. The Snow Maze constructed in Thunder Bay's Marina Park

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Christo's wrapped Reichstag building
6. The Spiral Jetty by Robert Smithson
7. A sand castle competition entry at Virginia Beach
8. The Gates installation in Central Park
9. An ice hotel room in Sweden
10. A carved pumpkin display at Halloween
11. The Cloud Gate sculpture in Chicago
12. A temporary chalk art street mural
13. An igloo built by indigenous peoples
14. A butter sculpture at a state fair
15. The Temple at Burning Man
16. A LEGO brick installation in Times Square
17. An ice skating rink in Rockefeller Center
18. A flower carpet in Brussels
19. The Fourth Plinth installations in London
20. A crop circle in Wiltshire
21. An inflatable art installation by Kurt Perschke
22. A domino toppling exhibition
23. A cardboard city installation
24. A light projection show on a building facade

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
