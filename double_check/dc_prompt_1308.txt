Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): geographical features that are named after their resemblance to human-made objects or structures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Table Mountain
2. Cathedral Rock
3. Castle Rock
4. Devil's Tower

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mount Everest
6. Grand Canyon
7. Amazon River
8. Niagara Falls
9. Great Barrier Reef
10. Lake Superior
11. Death Valley
12. Rocky Mountains
13. Yellowstone National Park
14. Black Forest
15. Victoria Falls
16. Mount Kilimanjaro
17. Yosemite Valley
18. Gobi Desert
19. Loch Ness
20. Serengeti Plains
21. Andes Mountains
22. Lake Baikal
23. Patagonia
24. Galapagos Islands

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
