Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that utilize a flexible, node-based structure to manage the distribution of a resource across a non-uniform, evolving topology.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a decentralized energy grid that dynamically allocates power based on regional demand and supply fluctuations
2. a peer-to-peer file-sharing network that adjusts data distribution based on node availability and bandwidth
3. a traffic management system that reroutes vehicles in real-time using adaptive algorithms to optimize flow across changing road conditions
4. a distributed computing framework that allocates processing tasks across a network of devices with varying capabilities and workloads

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a centralized water distribution system with fixed pipelines
6. a static website hosting service
7. a traditional postal service with predefined routes
8. a linear supply chain with no adaptive mechanisms
9. a single-server cloud storage system
10. a rigid hierarchical organizational structure
11. a fixed public transportation schedule
12. a manual irrigation system with no sensors or automation
13. a non-adaptive traffic light system
14. a traditional library catalog system
15. a basic email server with no load balancing
16. a linear conveyor belt in a factory
17. a static electricity grid with no smart meters
18. a manual inventory management system
19. a fixed-route delivery service
20. a non-adaptive HVAC system
21. a traditional landline telephone network
22. a rigid classroom seating arrangement
23. a basic radio broadcasting system
24. a non-dynamic video streaming platform

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
