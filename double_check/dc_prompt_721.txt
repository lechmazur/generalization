Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or events that are traditionally associated with navigation or orientation but have been adapted for competitive or entertainment purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A scavenger hunt using a compass
2. A GPS-based treasure hunt game
3. An orienteering race with checkpoints
4. A navigation-themed escape room

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traditional compass used for hiking
6. A map used for city navigation
7. A sextant used for maritime navigation
8. A GPS device used in a car
9. A star chart used for celestial navigation
10. A road atlas used for trip planning
11. A navigation app on a smartphone
12. A nautical chart used for boating
13. A pilot's flight plan
14. A topographic map used for wilderness navigation
15. A compass rose on a map
16. A GPS tracker used for tracking shipments
17. A navigation buoy in a harbor
18. A radar system used for air traffic control
19. A gyrocompass used on ships
20. A satellite navigation system
21. A navigation beacon for aviation
22. A marine VHF radio for communication
23. A land navigation course for military training
24. A GPS watch used for running

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
