Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ceremonial events that traditionally involve a specific numerical quantity of physical objects as part of their core ritual

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Seven candles in a menorah during Hanukkah
2. Three coins in a traditional Chinese New Year red envelope
3. Four cups of wine during the Passover Seder
4. Five stones in the Hindu ritual of Navaratri

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a single wedding ring
6. a bouquet of flowers
7. a pair of shoes
8. a dozen roses
9. a single candle on a birthday cake
10. a pair of chopsticks
11. a single flag at a parade
12. a single bell at a church
13. a pair of dice in a game
14. a single sword in a knight's ceremony
15. a single feather in a Native American headdress
16. a single egg in an Easter basket
17. a single loaf of bread in a communion service
18. a single cup of tea in a Japanese tea ceremony
19. a single olive branch in a peace offering
20. a single drum in a marching band
21. a single lantern in a festival
22. a single wreath at a memorial
23. a single apple in a harvest festival
24. a single star on a Christmas tree

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
