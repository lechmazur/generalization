Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Discoveries made using indirect observation methods where the existence of the discovered entity was initially inferred from its influence on other observable phenomena.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Neptune
2. Dark Matter
3. Exoplanets
4. Black Holes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gravity
6. Electricity
7. DNA
8. Photosynthesis
9. Evolution
10. Continental Drift
11. Atoms
12. Radio Waves
13. Quantum Entanglement
14. Plate Tectonics
15. Magnetism
16. Sound Waves
17. Viruses
18. Antimatter
19. Photosynthesis
20. Relativity
21. Cell Theory
22. Big Bang Theory
23. Radioactivity
24. Genetic Mutation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
