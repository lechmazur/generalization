Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural practices that involve the use of animal-derived materials to create functional items or foods

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Using sheep's wool to knit warm clothing
2. Preparing a traditional sausage using pig intestines as casing
3. Crafting a drum from deer hide
4. Making cheese from goat's milk

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Using synthetic fibers to create modern textiles
6. Preparing a vegan dish with plant-based ingredients
7. Creating a musical instrument from metal and wood
8. Using plastic to manufacture durable household items
9. Harvesting crops for traditional farming practices
10. Using digital technology to preserve cultural stories
11. Creating art from recycled materials
12. Performing a traditional dance without any props
13. Using plant-based dyes for fabric coloring
14. Building a shelter using natural materials like wood and stone
15. Creating pottery using clay and a kiln
16. Using modern machinery to process food
17. Harvesting seaweed for culinary use
18. Using silk from silkworms to make luxurious fabrics
19. Creating a traditional herbal remedy
20. Using feathers for decorative purposes in modern fashion
21. Preparing a dish using only vegetables and grains
22. Using modern adhesives to create functional items
23. Creating a traditional basket from plant fibers
24. Using modern synthetic materials to create sports equipment

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
