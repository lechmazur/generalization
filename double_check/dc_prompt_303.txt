Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Human-powered wheeled devices designed primarily for transporting bulk materials over short distances, featuring a single wheel and requiring the operator to lift and balance a portion of the load.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. garden wheelbarrow
2. construction wheelbarrow
3. concrete wheelbarrow
4. industrial wheelbarrow

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. hand truck
6. utility wagon
7. garden cart
8. bicycle trailer
9. moving dolly
10. pallet jack
11. tricycle cart
12. platform cart
13. push cart
14. shopping cart
15. luggage cart
16. wheel loader
17. forklift
18. dump cart
19. rolling toolbox
20. mail cart
21. beach wagon
22. golf cart
23. rolling garbage bin
24. hospital gurney

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
