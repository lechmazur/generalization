Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional performances that feature elaborate costumes and symbolic movements to convey cultural stories or rituals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Japanese Noh theater
2. Balinese Barong dance
3. Chinese Peking opera
4. Kathakali dance from India

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Broadway musical
6. Shakespearean play
7. Modern ballet
8. Street hip-hop dance
9. Contemporary circus performance
10. Stand-up comedy show
11. Rock concert
12. Improvisational theater
13. Mime performance
14. Jazz dance routine
15. Opera aria recital
16. Magic show
17. Film screening
18. Symphony orchestra concert
19. Spoken word poetry slam
20. Flash mob dance
21. Stand-up comedy
22. Modern art installation
23. Classical piano recital
24. Acrobatic gymnastics

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
