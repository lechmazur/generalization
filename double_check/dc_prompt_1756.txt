Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Condiments that are commonly used as toppings for hot dogs in the United States

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ketchup
2. mustard
3. relish
4. onion

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. mayonnaise
6. barbecue sauce
7. hot sauce
8. salsa
9. guacamole
10. cheese sauce
11. sour cream
12. pesto
13. soy sauce
14. teriyaki sauce
15. chili
16. coleslaw
17. jalape√±os
18. pickles
19. bacon bits
20. crushed potato chips
21. shredded lettuce
22. diced tomatoes
23. grated cheese
24. sauerkraut

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
