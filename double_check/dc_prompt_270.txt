Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures named after rivers that span multiple countries

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Danube Bridge
2. Rhine-Main-Danube Canal
3. Nile Dam
4. Amazon River Bridge

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Eiffel Tower
6. Golden Gate Bridge
7. Panama Canal
8. Hoover Dam
9. Mount Rushmore
10. Great Wall of China
11. Statue of Liberty
12. Burj Khalifa
13. Sydney Opera House
14. Colosseum
15. Machu Picchu
16. Taj Mahal
17. Petra
18. Angkor Wat
19. Christ the Redeemer
20. Big Ben
21. Stonehenge
22. Leaning Tower of Pisa
23. Empire State Building
24. CN Tower

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
