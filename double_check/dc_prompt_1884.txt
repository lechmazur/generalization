Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects found in natural environments that have been preserved through desiccation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A dried leaf
2. A desiccated mushroom
3. A preserved insect in a dry environment
4. A mummified animal found in a desert

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A fossilized bone
6. A piece of driftwood
7. A rock formation
8. A seashell on a beach
9. A preserved flower in resin
10. A taxidermied bird
11. A piece of amber
12. A dried fruit snack
13. A freeze-dried meal
14. A preserved specimen in alcohol
15. A petrified piece of wood
16. A coral skeleton
17. A pressed flower
18. A dehydrated vegetable chip
19. A sun-bleached bone
20. A preserved lizard in a jar
21. A dried seaweed sheet
22. A mummified pharaoh
23. A preserved butterfly in a frame
24. A dried herb used in cooking

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
