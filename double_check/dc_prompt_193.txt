Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made of woven fibers that have a functional purpose and are commonly found at the entrance of buildings

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. doormat
2. welcome mat
3. entryway rug
4. boot scraper mat

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. area rug
6. bath mat
7. kitchen towel
8. picnic blanket
9. tablecloth
10. curtain
11. tapestry
12. carpet
13. throw pillow
14. bedspread
15. hammock
16. laundry basket
17. woven basket
18. sun hat
19. beach towel
20. placemat
21. woven chair
22. garden hose
23. window blind
24. woven handbag

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
