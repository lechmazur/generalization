Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific discoveries made during artistic activities or events

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The discovery of the structure of benzene by Friedrich August Kekulé, inspired by a dream of a snake biting its own tail after attending a theater performance.
2. The invention of the stethoscope by René Laennec, who was inspired by watching children play with hollow sticks and listening to sounds through them.
3. The development of the theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, who was influenced by his love for playing the violin and the harmony of music.
4. The discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick, who were inspired by the symmetry and patterns observed in art and sculpture.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming after observing mold in a petri dish.
6. The invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell through experiments with sound transmission.
7. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel while studying phosphorescent materials.
8. The development of the polio vaccine by Jonas Salk through laboratory research.
9. The invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison after extensive experimentation with filaments.
10. The discovery of the electron by J.J. Thomson using cathode ray experiments.
11. The development of the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev through organizing chemical elements.
12. The discovery of the structure of insulin by Frederick Banting and Charles Best through medical research.
13. The invention of the airplane by the Wright brothers through engineering and aerodynamics studies.
14. The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick through nuclear experiments.
15. The development of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin through observations of natural selection.
16. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg through mechanical innovation.
17. The discovery of the circulation of blood by William Harvey through anatomical studies.
18. The development of the steam engine by James Watt through improvements in mechanical design.
19. The discovery of the laws of motion by Isaac Newton through mathematical analysis.
20. The invention of the microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek through lens crafting.
21. The discovery of the structure of the atom by Niels Bohr through quantum theory.
22. The development of the theory of electromagnetism by James Clerk Maxwell through mathematical equations.
23. The invention of the refrigerator by Carl von Linde through advancements in refrigeration technology.
24. The discovery of the vaccine for smallpox by Edward Jenner through observations of cowpox.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
