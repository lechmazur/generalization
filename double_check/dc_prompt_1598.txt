Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Specialized tools or devices used to track and coordinate the movement of multiple independent entities in real time

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. air traffic control radar systems
2. fleet management GPS trackers
3. wildlife tracking collars with satellite communication
4. real-time sports player tracking systems

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a stopwatch
6. a compass
7. a traffic light
8. a speedometer
9. a pedometer
10. a fitness tracker
11. a weather vane
12. a barometer
13. a heart rate monitor
14. a drone
15. a smartwatch
16. a motion sensor
17. a security camera
18. a GPS navigation device
19. a traffic cone
20. a bicycle odometer
21. a walkie-talkie
22. a laser pointer
23. a digital thermometer
24. a car dashboard

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
