Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or symbols that incorporate animal bones as a central element in their design or function, often imbued with cultural, spiritual, or practical significance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Shamanic rattles made from animal bones
2. Bone jewelry used in tribal ceremonies
3. Bone flutes used in ancient rituals
4. Totem poles incorporating animal bones

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Wooden masks used in festivals
6. Stone carvings of animals
7. Metal amulets shaped like animals
8. Feather headdresses
9. Clay pottery with animal motifs
10. Ivory carvings
11. Leather drums
12. Silk tapestries depicting wildlife
13. Glass beads with animal designs
14. Wooden totem poles
15. Stone arrowheads
16. Metal swords with animal engravings
17. Woolen blankets with animal patterns
18. Bronze statues of animals
19. Paper lanterns with animal prints
20. Gold jewelry with animal shapes
21. Stonehenge
22. Wooden birdhouses
23. Plastic toys shaped like animals
24. Silk scarves with animal prints

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
