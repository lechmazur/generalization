Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Public figures or events that have been commemorated through both a major international airport and a competitive artistic or intellectual event.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Leonardo da Vinci
2. Johann Sebastian Bach
3. Albert Einstein
4. Marie Curie

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Elvis Presley
6. Oprah Winfrey
7. Michael Jordan
8. World War II
9. The Beatles
10. Christopher Columbus
11. Nelson Mandela
12. The Renaissance
13. Mahatma Gandhi
14. Martin Luther King Jr.
15. The Industrial Revolution
16. William Shakespeare
17. The Cold War
18. Charles Darwin
19. The French Revolution
20. Steve Jobs
21. The American Civil War
22. Queen Elizabeth II
23. The Space Race
24. Bill Gates

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
