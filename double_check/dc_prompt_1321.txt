Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): structures or objects that achieve stability or functionality through minimal material use and geometric precision

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a geodesic dome
2. a suspension bridge
3. a honeycomb structure
4. a tensegrity sculpture

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a brick wall
6. a solid concrete block
7. a wooden log cabin
8. a steel beam
9. a marble statue
10. a solid gold bar
11. a granite countertop
12. a solid oak table
13. a clay pot
14. a cast iron skillet
15. a stone monument
16. a brick chimney
17. a wooden fence
18. a concrete sidewalk
19. a solid metal door
20. a ceramic vase
21. a plastic chair
22. a glass window pane
23. a wooden bookshelf
24. a metal filing cabinet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
