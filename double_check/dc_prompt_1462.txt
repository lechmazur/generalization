Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Software programs that actively monitor and patrol a system's activity in real-time to prevent unwanted changes or intrusions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kaspersky Endpoint Security
2. McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention
3. Symantec Endpoint Protection
4. CrowdStrike Falcon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Windows Task Manager
6. Network packet analyzer
7. System log viewer
8. Password manager
9. Disk cleanup utility
10. File recovery software
11. Disk defragmentation tool
12. System backup software
13. Registry cleaner
14. Performance monitor
15. Software update checker
16. Hardware diagnostic tool
17. Network bandwidth monitor
18. File encryption program
19. Data wiping utility
20. System information viewer
21. Driver update utility
22. Memory optimization tool
23. File compression software
24. Disk partitioning utility

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
