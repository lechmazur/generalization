Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to facilitate quiet contemplation or introspection in a natural setting, incorporating natural materials and minimal human intervention.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A smooth river stone meditation bench placed in a garden clearing
2. A bamboo tea pavilion with earthen floor overlooking a pond
3. A carved driftwood seat nestled among coastal rocks
4. A moss-covered granite viewing platform in a forest grove

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A concrete meditation labyrinth
6. A metal wind chime
7. A Buddhist temple
8. A prayer wheel
9. A meditation cushion
10. A zen garden rake
11. A glass greenhouse
12. A wooden park bench
13. A stone fountain
14. A meditation app
15. A yoga platform
16. A garden gazebo
17. A mindfulness journal
18. A prayer bead necklace
19. An incense holder
20. A meditation bell
21. A bird watching blind
22. A garden trellis
23. A sundial
24. A reflecting pool

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
