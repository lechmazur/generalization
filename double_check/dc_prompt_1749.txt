Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in performances that produce visual effects through chemical reactions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. flash powder
2. lycopodium powder
3. colored smoke pellets
4. dragon's breath compounds

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. strobe lights
6. fog machines
7. laser pointers
8. black lights
9. sparklers
10. glow sticks
11. mirror balls
12. bubble machines
13. confetti cannons
14. LED wands
15. dry ice
16. stage makeup
17. neon signs
18. projection screens
19. light filters
20. fiber optic curtains
21. glitter bombs
22. UV paint
23. phosphorescent tape
24. smoke machines

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
