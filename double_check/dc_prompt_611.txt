Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographic features smaller than 10 square kilometers entirely surrounded by freshwater with evidence of permanent human habitation prior to 1800 CE.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Isle of Inishmore, Ireland
2. Saint Helena Island, Michigan, USA
3. Isola Comacina, Italy
4. Isle of Seil, Scotland

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Lake Superior
6. Great Barrier Reef
7. Mount Everest
8. Grand Canyon
9. Yellowstone National Park
10. Seine River
11. Victoria Falls
12. Great Victoria Desert
13. Manhattan Island
14. Sahara Desert
15. Amazon Rainforest
16. Great Wall of China
17. Pyramids of Giza
18. Statue of Liberty
19. Eiffel Tower
20. Colosseum
21. Stonehenge
22. Acropolis
23. Machu Picchu
24. Chichen Itza

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
