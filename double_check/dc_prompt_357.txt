Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Depictions of symbiotic relationships between humans and nature in public art installations completed after 2000.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cloud Gate in Chicago's Millennium Park
2. The Living Root Bridge in Meghalaya, India
3. The Green Cathedral in Belgium
4. The Rain Room at MoMA

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Statue of Liberty
6. Mount Rushmore
7. A traditional Japanese zen garden
8. The Gardens of Versailles
9. Ancient Mayan temple ruins
10. The Moai statues of Easter Island
11. A community vegetable garden
12. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
13. Central Park in New York City
14. The Great Wall of China
15. Stonehenge
16. A botanical greenhouse
17. The Nazca Lines in Peru
18. An ancient Roman aqueduct
19. A traditional English hedge maze
20. The Pyramids of Giza
21. A medieval castle garden
22. The Terracotta Army
23. An Indigenous Australian rock painting
24. A Victorian conservatory

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
