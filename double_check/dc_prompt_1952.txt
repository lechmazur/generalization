Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical structures originally built for public transportation but now repurposed for non-transportation uses

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. High Line in New York City
2. Orsay Museum in Paris
3. St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel in London
4. Gasometer City in Vienna

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Brooklyn Bridge in New York City
6. Colosseum in Rome
7. Great Wall of China
8. Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco
9. Empire State Building in New York City
10. Big Ben in London
11. Statue of Liberty in New York City
12. Eiffel Tower in Paris
13. Acropolis in Athens
14. Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris
15. Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro
16. Stonehenge in England
17. Mount Rushmore in South Dakota
18. Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy
19. Hagia Sophia in Istanbul
20. Petra in Jordan
21. Alhambra in Spain
22. Forbidden City in Beijing
23. Sydney Opera House in Australia
24. Burj Khalifa in Dubai

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
