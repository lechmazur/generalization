Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological advancements that were inspired by ancient cultural practices or artifacts

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sonar technology, inspired by the echolocation abilities of bats observed in ancient cultures.
2. The development of earthquake-resistant building techniques based on ancient Incan dry-stone construction methods.
3. Modern aerodynamic designs in aviation and high-speed trains, drawing inspiration from the streamlined shapes of ancient boomerangs.
4. The creation of self-healing concrete, inspired by the self-repairing properties of Roman concrete observed in ancient structures.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the wheel.
6. The development of agriculture.
7. The discovery of fire.
8. The invention of the printing press.
9. The development of the steam engine.
10. The invention of the telephone.
11. The development of the internet.
12. The invention of the computer.
13. The development of artificial intelligence.
14. The invention of the telescope.
15. The development of the microscope.
16. The invention of the light bulb.
17. The development of nuclear power.
18. The invention of the airplane.
19. The development of space travel.
20. Biomimicry inspired by modern organisms.
21. Ancient Greek philosophy influencing modern thought.
22. Traditional medicine informing modern pharmaceuticals.
23. Ancient art styles inspiring modern art movements.
24. Ancient mythology influencing modern storytelling.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
