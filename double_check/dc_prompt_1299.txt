Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or entities named after individuals who made significant contributions to their respective fields but are not widely recognized outside of specialized communities.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fibonacci sequence
2. Apgar score
3. Hodgkin's lymphoma
4. Riemann hypothesis

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Newton's laws
6. Einstein's theory of relativity
7. Darwin's theory of evolution
8. Curie's law
9. Hubble's law
10. Archimedes' principle
11. Boyle's law
12. Pascal's triangle
13. Ohm's law
14. Faraday's law
15. Kepler's laws
16. Planck's constant
17. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
18. Schrodinger's cat
19. Hawking radiation
20. Maxwell's equations
21. Gauss's law
22. Avogadro's number
23. Bernoulli's principle
24. Fermat's last theorem

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
