Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative items made of black velvet featuring celestial motifs

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A black velvet choker necklace with a crescent moon pendant
2. A black velvet painting of a starry night sky
3. A small, black velvet pouch embroidered with gold stars
4. A black velvet throw pillow with a sequined depiction of the Big Dipper

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A velvet painting of Elvis
6. A star-shaped cookie cutter
7. A telescope
8. A book on astronomy
9. A glow-in-the-dark sticker of Saturn
10. A blue velvet dress
11. A black velvet top hat
12. A silver locket with a photo of the moon
13. A tapestry depicting the zodiac signs
14. A constellation map
15. A pair of moonstone earrings
16. A framed photograph of a nebula
17. A black velvet ribbon
18. A decorative sun mirror
19. A ceramic plate with a celestial design
20. A crystal ball
21. A tarot card deck featuring celestial imagery
22. A black velvet scrunchie
23. A pair of black velvet gloves
24. A music box that plays "Fly Me to the Moon"

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
