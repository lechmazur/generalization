Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made of lightweight materials designed for repeated use in food service

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Reusable silicone food storage bags
2. Stainless steel straws
3. Bamboo utensils
4. Melamine dinnerware

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Disposable plastic cutlery
6. Paper plates
7. Glass wine glasses
8. Aluminum foil
9. Ceramic mugs
10. Single-use coffee pods
11. Plastic water bottles
12. Cardboard takeout containers
13. Heavy cast iron skillets
14. Styrofoam cups
15. Wooden chopsticks
16. Porcelain serving dishes
17. Copper cookware
18. Disposable napkins
19. Lead crystal goblets
20. Plastic wrap
21. Enameled steel pots
22. Paper coffee filters
23. Heavy-duty aluminum baking sheets
24. Disposable latex gloves

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
