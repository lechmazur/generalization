Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that use a hexagonal or honeycomb pattern as their primary structural component for environmental monitoring or protection

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sentinel-3 satellite's optical sensor array
2. HEXHIVE pollution monitoring network
3. BeeSense environmental monitoring stations
4. HexShield coral reef protection system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Chain-link security fence
6. Chicken wire mesh
7. Soccer goal net
8. Beehive
9. Carbon fiber fabric
10. Graphene sheet
11. Turtle shell
12. Snake scales
13. Pineapple skin
14. Basketball net
15. Wire mesh screen
16. Dragon scales
17. Hexagonal floor tiles
18. Snowflake crystal
19. DNA double helix
20. Spider web
21. Fish scales
22. Basalt columns
23. Crystal lattice structure
24. Chainmail armor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
