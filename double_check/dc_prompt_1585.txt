Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Unfinished or partially complete architectural structures that were inhabited for at least 5 years before completion

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Barcelona's Sagrada Familia from 1882-1915
2. Winchester Mystery House from 1884-1922
3. Boldt Castle from 1900-1977
4. Palace of Parliament in Bucharest from 1984-1997

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Empire State Building construction site
6. Abandoned Ryugyong Hotel in Pyongyang
7. Unfinished Foreshore Freeway Bridge in Cape Town
8. Watts Towers during construction
9. Notre-Dame Cathedral during medieval construction
10. Temporary construction housing units
11. Ancient Roman ruins
12. Half-built suburban development
13. Partially completed shopping mall
14. Construction-phase Olympic village
15. Incomplete highway overpass
16. Partially built skyscraper
17. Abandoned construction project
18. Temporary festival structures
19. Building renovation site
20. Partially demolished building
21. Earthquake-damaged structure
22. Incomplete bridge project
23. Construction-phase airport terminal
24. Partially built stadium

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
