Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures designed by women that incorporate elements of social justice or activism

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Ruth Ellis Center in Detroit, Michigan by Sharon Davis Design
2. The Women's Opportunity Center in Rwanda by Sharon Davis Design
3. The Studio Gang-designed Gilder Center at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City
4. The Van Alen Institute’s “Inside Out” community-based urban design project led by Elizabeth Diller

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Louvre Pyramid
6. Fallingwater
7. The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao
8. The Sydney Opera House
9. The Burj Khalifa
10. The Taj Mahal
11. The Colosseum
12. The Great Wall of China
13. Machu Picchu
14. The Empire State Building
15. The Chrysler Building
16. The Shard
17. Petronas Towers
18. The National Museum of African American History and Culture
19. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial
20. The Heydar Aliyev Center
21. The Walt Disney Concert Hall
22. Habitat 67
23. The CCTV Headquarters
24. The Seattle Central Library

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
