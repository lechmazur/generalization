Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or man-made systems that exhibit fractal-like branching patterns and are named after a specific geographic or cultural reference.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Amazon River Basin
2. Yggdrasil Tree
3. Himalayan Glacial Network
4. Nile Delta

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Golden Gate Bridge
6. Mount Everest
7. Great Wall of China
8. Grand Canyon
9. Pacific Ocean
10. Stonehenge
11. Amazon Rainforest
12. Niagara Falls
13. Great Barrier Reef
14. Lake Baikal
15. Sahara Desert
16. Victoria Falls
17. Rocky Mountains
18. Yellowstone National Park
19. Gobi Desert
20. Angel Falls
21. Galapagos Islands
22. Mount Kilimanjaro
23. Dead Sea
24. Antarctic Ice Sheet

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
