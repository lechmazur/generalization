Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in traditional outdoor activities that involve specialized equipment for balance or support

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ski poles
2. climbing rope
3. walking stick
4. ice axe

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. baseball bat
6. tennis racket
7. fishing rod
8. bicycle
9. skateboard
10. roller skates
11. football helmet
12. golf club
13. surfboard
14. kayak paddle
15. hockey stick
16. frisbee
17. volleyball net
18. soccer cleats
19. basketball hoop
20. archery bow
21. cricket bat
22. lacrosse stick
23. boxing gloves
24. snowboard

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
