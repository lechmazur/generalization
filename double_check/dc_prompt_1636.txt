Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring fractal patterns that form in brackish or saline water bodies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The intricate branching patterns of mangrove roots in estuarine environments
2. The formation of salt crystals on the surface of hypersaline lagoons
3. The fractal-like distribution of phytoplankton blooms in coastal saline waters
4. The complex network of tidal channels in salt marshes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The fractal patterns of river deltas
6. The branching patterns of lightning in the sky
7. The fractal geometry of snowflakes
8. The self-similar patterns in broccoli florets
9. The fractal structure of Romanesco cauliflower
10. The branching patterns of trees in a forest
11. The fractal patterns in mountain ranges
12. The self-similar patterns in coastlines
13. The fractal patterns in clouds
14. The branching patterns of blood vessels
15. The fractal patterns in coral reefs
16. The self-similar patterns in fern leaves
17. The fractal patterns in the structure of lungs
18. The branching patterns of river systems
19. The fractal patterns in the structure of galaxies
20. The self-similar patterns in the growth of bacterial colonies
21. The fractal patterns in the structure of sponges
22. The branching patterns of neural networks
23. The fractal patterns in the structure of crystals
24. The self-similar patterns in the formation of sand dunes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
