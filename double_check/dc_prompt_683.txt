Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that utilize controlled combustion for artistic or entertainment purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fire dancing
2. Indoor fireworks displays
3. Flamethrowers in theatrical productions
4. Burning sculptures

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Campfire
6. Fireplace
7. Gas stove
8. Internal combustion engine
9. Welding
10. Candle
11. Oil lamp
12. Bunsen burner
13. Fireworks for celebrations
14. Controlled burns in forestry
15. Cremation
16. Glassblowing
17. Ceramics firing
18. Hot air balloon
19. Incense
20. Charcoal grill
21. Gas lighting
22. Jet engine
23. Rocket propulsion
24. Wood-fired pizza oven

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
