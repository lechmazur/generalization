Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools or weapons constructed using a lashing technique where a separate, flexible material binds two or more rigid components together.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A traditional Polynesian paddle with a wooden blade and handle bound together with plant fibers.
2. An ancient Egyptian spear with a stone tip lashed to a wooden shaft using animal sinew.
3. A Native American bow with the limbs attached to the grip using rawhide strips.
4. A medieval European flail with the handle and chain connected using leather thongs.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern composite bow with limbs attached using epoxy resin.
6. A metal hammer with a welded handle.
7. A wooden staff carved from a single piece of wood.
8. A plastic toy sword with a glued handle.
9. A steel axe with a handle secured by a metal wedge.
10. A bamboo fishing rod with sections connected by ferrules.
11. A carbon fiber tennis racket with a one-piece frame.
12. A kitchen knife with a handle attached using rivets.
13. A baseball bat made from a single piece of aluminum.
14. A garden hoe with a metal blade and wooden handle connected by a bolt.
15. A golf club with a shaft and head joined by a hosel.
16. A carpenter's saw with a handle and blade connected by screws.
17. A metal rake with tines welded to the handle.
18. A plastic shovel with a molded handle and blade.
19. A wooden mallet with a handle inserted into a mortise.
20. A metal chisel with a handle secured by a ferrule.
21. A fiberglass fishing pole with a one-piece construction.
22. A garden trowel with a handle and blade made from a single piece of metal.
23. A metal crowbar with a solid, one-piece design.
24. A wooden rolling pin carved from a single piece of wood.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
