Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient texts that describe cataclysmic events attributed to divine intervention

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Epic of Gilgamesh, which describes a great flood sent by the gods to destroy humanity.
2. The Book of Exodus, detailing the Ten Plagues of Egypt as divine punishment.
3. The Mahabharata, recounting the destruction of the city of Dwaraka by a divine storm.
4. The Popol Vuh, describing the gods' destruction of an early, flawed version of humanity through a great flood.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Iliad, which recounts the Trojan War and the involvement of Greek gods.
6. The Bhagavad Gita, focusing on the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna about duty and righteousness.
7. The Code of Hammurabi, a set of laws attributed to divine inspiration.
8. The Dead Sea Scrolls, containing religious texts and commentaries.
9. The Tao Te Ching, a philosophical text on the nature of the Tao.
10. The Aeneid, which narrates the journey of Aeneas and the founding of Rome.
11. The Analects of Confucius, a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to Confucius.
12. The Quran, the central religious text of Islam.
13. The Book of Revelation, describing apocalyptic visions of the end times.
14. The Rigveda, a collection of ancient Indian hymns and prayers.
15. The Odyssey, detailing Odysseus's journey home after the Trojan War.
16. The Upanishads, philosophical texts exploring the nature of reality and the self.
17. The Enuma Elish, a Babylonian creation myth.
18. The Book of Genesis, describing the creation of the world and early human history.
19. The Ramayana, an epic about the life and adventures of Rama.
20. The Zend Avesta, the primary collection of Zoroastrian religious texts.
21. The Eddas, Norse mythological texts detailing the deeds of gods and heroes.
22. The Book of Job, exploring themes of suffering and divine justice.
23. The Gospel of Matthew, one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament.
24. The Art of War, a treatise on military strategy attributed to Sun Tzu.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
