Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Seasonal festivals that celebrate the blooming of specific flowers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cherry Blossom Festival in Japan
2. Rose Festival in Bulgaria
3. Tulip Festival in the Netherlands
4. Lavender Festival in France

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Oktoberfest in Germany
6. Diwali in India
7. Rio Carnival in Brazil
8. Thanksgiving in the United States
9. Chinese New Year
10. St. Patrick's Day in Ireland
11. Day of the Dead in Mexico
12. Holi Festival in India
13. Mardi Gras in New Orleans
14. Christmas Markets in Germany
15. Summer Solstice at Stonehenge
16. La Tomatina in Spain
17. Running of the Bulls in Pamplona
18. Venice Carnival in Italy
19. Burning Man in Nevada
20. Gion Matsuri in Japan
21. Edinburgh Festival Fringe
22. Coachella Music Festival
23. Winterlude in Canada
24. Harbin Ice Festival in China

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
