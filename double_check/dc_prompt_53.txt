Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed for human use that incorporate a non-functional, miniature version of themselves as a decorative element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A purse with a tiny, non-functional replica of the same purse attached as a charm.
2. A desk lamp featuring a miniature, non-working version of the same lamp design built into the base.
3. A watering can with a small, decorative version of itself fixed to the handle.
4. A ceramic teapot with a tiny, non-functional replica of the teapot forming the lid's knob.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A nesting doll
6. A model train set
7. A toy car
8. A dollhouse
9. A miniature painting of a landscape
10. A bonsai tree
11. A snow globe
12. A keychain with a photo of a car
13. A locket with a picture of a loved one
14. A building with a scale model in the lobby
15. A ship in a bottle
16. A stamp depicting a larger object
17. A thimble
18. A miniature portrait
19. A charm bracelet
20. A set of measuring spoons
21. Russian nesting dolls
22. A miniature replica of a famous landmark
23. A scale model of an airplane
24. A small figurine of a person

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
