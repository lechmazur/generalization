Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that enable remote control and monitoring of complex systems in inaccessible environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with acoustic communication systems for deep-sea exploration
2. Satellite-linked sensor networks for monitoring structural integrity of bridges in remote areas
3. Wireless robotic surgery systems with haptic feedback for telesurgery
4. Radiation-hardened cameras and manipulators for handling nuclear materials in hot cells

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smart home thermostat controlled via a mobile app
6. Bluetooth headphones for listening to music wirelessly
7. Keyless entry system for a car
8. GPS tracking device for a pet
9. Video conferencing software for remote meetings
10. Cloud-based storage for accessing files from anywhere
11. Industrial robots used in automated assembly lines
12. Security cameras monitored from a central location
13. Drones used for aerial photography and videography
14. Self-driving cars navigating using sensors and GPS
15. Wearable fitness trackers monitoring heart rate and activity levels
16. Remote desktop software for accessing a computer from another device
17. Automated irrigation systems controlled by weather sensors
18. Traffic lights controlled by a central system
19. Wireless weather stations transmitting data to a central hub
20. Smart grids managing electricity distribution remotely
21. Telepresence robots allowing remote interaction in offices
22. Virtual reality headsets for immersive gaming experiences
23. Augmented reality applications overlaying digital information on the real world
24. 3D printers creating objects from digital designs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
