Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural processes or mechanisms that involve the movement or transfer of substances within living organisms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. osmosis in plant roots
2. blood circulation through capillaries
3. active transport across cell membranes
4. lymphatic drainage in tissues

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. ocean currents
6. wind patterns
7. volcanic eruptions
8. postal delivery system
9. train transportation
10. river flow
11. conveyor belts
12. elevator movement
13. pipeline transport
14. cargo shipping
15. email transmission
16. water cycle
17. plate tectonics
18. traffic flow
19. assembly line production
20. package delivery
21. data transfer
22. electrical current
23. sewage systems
24. air conditioning circulation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
