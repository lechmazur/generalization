Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Village-level traditional governance systems that use circular physical arrangements for community decision-making

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Gacaca courts of Rwanda
2. Fono meeting houses in Samoan villages
3. Kurultai assemblies of Mongolian nomadic communities
4. Ndaba tribal gathering circles of Zulu villages

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. United Nations Security Council
6. Ancient Greek amphitheater
7. Traditional Native American powwow
8. Medieval European round table
9. Modern town hall meeting
10. Buddhist temple meditation hall
11. Roman Forum
12. Village elder's council tree
13. Tribal ceremonial fire circle
14. Celtic stone circle
15. Indigenous Australian songline gathering
16. African palaver tree meetings
17. Aztec ceremonial plaza
18. Viking thing assembly
19. Traditional Irish ringfort
20. Maori marae gathering space
21. Persian garden council
22. Chinese imperial court
23. Incan huaca ceremonial site
24. Japanese tea ceremony room

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
