Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems that utilize geometric transformations to achieve spatial optimization in physical environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Robotic arm path planning in manufacturing
2. Automated warehouse storage and retrieval systems
3. 3D printing layer optimization algorithms
4. Traffic flow optimization in smart cities

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Architectural design software
6. Urban planning models
7. Computer-aided design (CAD) systems
8. Virtual reality environments
9. Augmented reality applications
10. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
11. Robotic navigation systems
12. Automated vehicle routing
13. Drone flight path planning
14. Logistics and supply chain management
15. Facility layout planning
16. Interior design software
17. Landscape architecture tools
18. Building Information Modeling (BIM)
19. Energy efficiency modeling in buildings
20. Environmental impact assessment tools
21. Simulation software for crowd management
22. Optimization algorithms for resource allocation
23. Network topology design
24. Computational fluid dynamics for HVAC systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
