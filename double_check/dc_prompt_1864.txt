Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional rituals involving the collection and use of natural water sources at specific times of day

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Drawing water from a sacred well at dawn for a purification ritual.
2. Collecting dew from specific plants before sunrise for medicinal purposes.
3. Bathing in a river at midday during a solstice festival.
4. Offering water collected from a waterfall at sunset as part of an ancestral veneration ceremony.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Swimming in a lake for recreation.
6. Using rainwater for irrigation.
7. Drinking water from a tap.
8. Collecting spring water for bottling.
9. Washing clothes in a river.
10. Praying at a lakeside shrine.
11. Meditating near a waterfall.
12. Fishing in a stream.
13. Building a dam on a river.
14. Sailing on the ocean.
15. Watching the sunrise over the sea.
16. Visiting a hot spring for relaxation.
17. Studying the properties of water.
18. Collecting rainwater for scientific analysis.
19. Using a well for drinking water in a rural community.
20. Watering plants with a watering can.
21. Taking a shower.
22. Brushing teeth with tap water.
23. Making ice cubes.
24. Boiling water for tea.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
