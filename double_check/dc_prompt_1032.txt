Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures that rely on hidden or obscured mechanisms to function effectively, where the underlying processes are not immediately visible or understood by casual observation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A termite mound's internal ventilation
2. The human endocrine system
3. A car's electronic fuel injection
4. A smartphone's background app refresh

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A grandfather clock
6. A pulley system
7. A light switch
8. A bicycle gear chain
9. A door lock
10. A water fountain
11. A mechanical watch
12. A piano keyboard
13. A vending machine
14. A windmill
15. A telescope
16. A microscope
17. A camera lens
18. A combination safe
19. A pinball machine
20. A typewriter
21. A sewing machine
22. A music box
23. A steam engine
24. A sundial

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
