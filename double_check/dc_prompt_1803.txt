Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects used in rituals that involve the invocation of spirits or deities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. obsidian mirror
2. singing bowl
3. ceremonial rattle
4. divining bones

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. wedding ring
6. baptismal font
7. prayer beads
8. meditation cushion
9. temple bell
10. sacred text
11. prayer rug
12. holy water
13. incense holder
14. altar cloth
15. communion chalice
16. ceremonial sword
17. ritual mask
18. sacred vessel
19. prayer wheel
20. offering plate
21. ritual drum
22. blessing oil
23. ceremonial staff
24. sacred candle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
