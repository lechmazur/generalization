Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Rooms or spaces specifically designed for tracking and coordinating multiple moving objects in real-time through technological means

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Air traffic control tower
2. Maritime vessel traffic service center
3. Drone operations control room
4. Satellite tracking and command center

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Security surveillance room
6. Video game development studio
7. Weather forecasting center
8. Stock trading floor
9. Traffic management center
10. Logistics and supply chain operations center
11. Network operations center
12. Emergency response coordination center
13. Space mission control room
14. Automated warehouse management system
15. Public transportation control center
16. Border control and monitoring facility
17. Wildlife tracking and research station
18. Event management and crowd control center
19. Robotics testing and control lab
20. Telecommunications monitoring center
21. Environmental monitoring and response center
22. Automotive testing and simulation facility
23. Healthcare patient monitoring center
24. Retail inventory management system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
