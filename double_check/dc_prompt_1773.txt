Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Headwear traditionally worn by specific ethnic groups during cultural ceremonies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kippah
2. Gele
3. Chador
4. Kasa

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Baseball cap
6. Cowboy hat
7. Beret
8. Crown
9. Graduation cap
10. Military helmet
11. Construction hardhat
12. Chef's toque
13. Nurse's cap
14. Police officer's hat
15. Beanie
16. Fedora
17. Visor
18. Bucket hat
19. Top hat
20. Bonnet
21. Newsboy cap
22. Bowler hat
23. Fascinator
24. Deerstalker

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
