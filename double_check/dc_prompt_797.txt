Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures that incorporate intricate woodwork to create an illusion of simplicity while concealing complex engineering techniques.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kinkaku-ji Temple in Kyoto
2. Gamble House in Pasadena
3. Thorncrown Chapel in Arkansas
4. Villa Mairea in Finland

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Eiffel Tower
6. Taj Mahal
7. Sydney Opera House
8. Traditional Japanese pagoda
9. Log cabin
10. Wooden bridge in Lucerne
11. Notre-Dame Cathedral
12. Traditional Norwegian stave church
13. Fallingwater house
14. Empire State Building
15. Wooden gazebo
16. Traditional Chinese pavilion
17. Modern glass skyscraper
18. Wooden treehouse
19. Gothic cathedral
20. Bamboo house
21. Traditional Russian izba
22. Modern concrete building
23. Ancient Greek temple
24. Victorian mansion

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
