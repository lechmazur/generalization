Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): architectural structures designed for both aesthetic appeal and functional airflow management

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a windcatcher tower
2. a louvered facade
3. a perforated metal screen wall
4. a courtyard with strategically placed openings

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a skyscraper
6. a suspension bridge
7. a geodesic dome
8. a glass atrium
9. a stone archway
10. a brick chimney
11. a wooden gazebo
12. a steel beam structure
13. a concrete dam
14. a marble fountain
15. a thatched roof hut
16. a glass skylight
17. a brick wall
18. a wooden pergola
19. a metal staircase
20. a stone monument
21. a glass greenhouse
22. a brick oven
23. a wooden fence
24. a concrete bunker

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
