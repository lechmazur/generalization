Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Coastal infrastructure projects that harness natural water movement to generate both renewable energy and aquaculture benefits

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tidal barrage system with integrated seaweed and shellfish cultivation in South Korea's Sihwa Lake
2. Wave-powered floating oyster farm platform off the coast of Maine
3. Integrated tidal energy and salmon farming facility in Scotland's Pentland Firth
4. Multi-purpose breakwater combining wave energy capture and mussel farming in New Zealand

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Traditional hydroelectric dam
6. Offshore wind farm
7. Standalone oyster farm
8. Coastal flood barrier
9. Tidal stream turbine
10. Fish farming nets
11. Wave energy buoy
12. Seaweed cultivation platform
13. Desalination plant
14. Marine research station
15. Artificial reef
16. Floating solar array
17. Coastal protection seawall
18. Ocean thermal energy plant
19. Fish processing facility
20. Marine cargo port
21. Underwater turbine array
22. Coastal wetland restoration
23. Floating fish farm
24. Offshore drilling platform

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
