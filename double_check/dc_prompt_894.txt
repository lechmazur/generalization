Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mathematical concepts named after people that are used in quantum mechanics

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Schr√∂dinger equation
2. Heisenberg uncertainty principle
3. Pauli exclusion principle
4. Born rule

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Newton's laws of motion
6. Euler's formula
7. Fibonacci sequence
8. Pythagorean theorem
9. Archimedes' principle
10. Gauss's law
11. Fourier transform
12. Laplace's equation
13. Riemann hypothesis
14. Fermat's last theorem
15. Pascal's triangle
16. Kepler's laws
17. Bernoulli's principle
18. Planck's constant
19. Bohr model
20. Einstein's theory of relativity
21. Maxwell's equations
22. Dirac delta function
23. Boltzmann constant
24. Avogadro's number

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
