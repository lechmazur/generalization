Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Containers used for storing or transporting liquids, made from materials other than glass or metal, and dating from before the 20th century.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a ceramic amphora
2. a wooden cask
3. a leather waterskin
4. a gourd flask

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a glass bottle
6. a metal flask
7. a plastic jug
8. a glass decanter
9. a steel thermos
10. a glass jar
11. a metal canteen
12. a glass vial
13. a stainless steel water bottle
14. a glass pitcher
15. a metal tank
16. a glass carafe
17. a metal barrel
18. a glass goblet
19. a metal canister
20. a glass tumbler
21. a metal keg
22. a glass flask
23. a metal bucket
24. a glass chalice

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
