Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Innovations designed to facilitate decomposition in extreme environments

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A genetically engineered psychrophilic fungus designed to break down plastics in Antarctic ice.
2. A self-contained, solar-powered bioreactor utilizing extremophile bacteria to decompose organic waste in desert conditions.
3. A specialized enzyme cocktail developed for hydrolyzing cellulose in the highly alkaline environment of a soda lake.
4. A bioaugmentation strategy employing radiation-resistant microbes to remediate radioactive waste in a deep geological repository.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Composting food scraps in a backyard bin.
6. Using worms to create vermicompost.
7. Anaerobic digestion of manure in a biogas digester.
8. A landfill designed to capture methane gas.
9. Bioremediation of oil spills in the ocean.
10. Using bacteria to leach metals from ore.
11. Developing drought-resistant crops.
12. Creating biodegradable plastics from plant-based materials.
13. Recycling paper and cardboard.
14. Treating wastewater in a sewage treatment plant.
15. Developing new methods for carbon capture.
16. Using enzymes in laundry detergent.
17. Genetically modifying bacteria to produce insulin.
18. Developing vaccines for infectious diseases.
19. Creating artificial organs for transplantation.
20. Developing new cancer treatments.
21. Exploring the use of CRISPR technology for gene editing.
22. Developing new materials for 3D printing.
23. Creating sustainable energy sources.
24. Developing new methods for water purification.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
