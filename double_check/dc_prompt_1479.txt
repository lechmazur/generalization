Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Automated systems that use temperature sensors to trigger emergency shutdown procedures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. An industrial furnace that shuts down when internal temperatures exceed 1200째C.
2. A nuclear reactor cooling system that activates an emergency stop if coolant temperatures rise above 300째C.
3. A data center cooling unit that powers off servers if ambient temperatures surpass 40째C.
4. A vehicle engine management system that halts operation if the engine block temperature reaches 150째C.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smoke detector that triggers an alarm when smoke is detected.
6. A motion sensor that activates lights when movement is detected.
7. A pressure valve that releases steam when pressure exceeds a set limit.
8. A flood sensor that shuts off water supply when water levels rise.
9. A security system that locks doors when unauthorized access is detected.
10. A gas leak detector that shuts off gas lines when methane is detected.
11. A wind turbine that stops spinning when wind speeds exceed 100 km/h.
12. A fire suppression system that releases foam when flames are detected.
13. A humidity sensor that activates a dehumidifier when moisture levels rise.
14. A light sensor that adjusts brightness based on ambient light levels.
15. A carbon monoxide detector that sounds an alarm when CO levels are high.
16. A vibration sensor that shuts down machinery when excessive vibrations occur.
17. A water heater that turns off when water reaches boiling point.
18. A speed limiter that reduces engine power when a vehicle exceeds 120 km/h.
19. A battery management system that stops charging when the battery is full.
20. A doorbell that rings when someone approaches the door.
21. A thermostat that adjusts heating based on room temperature.
22. A UV sensor that closes blinds when sunlight intensity is too high.
23. A weight sensor that stops a conveyor belt when a load exceeds capacity.
24. A proximity sensor that locks a door when no one is nearby.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
