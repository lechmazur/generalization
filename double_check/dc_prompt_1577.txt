Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ancient architectural sites that incorporated astronomical alignments to track seasonal changes and were built without mortar

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stonehenge in England
2. Chichen Itza's El Castillo in Mexico
3. Newgrange in Ireland
4. Machu Picchu's Intihuatana in Peru

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Great Wall of China
6. The Colosseum in Rome
7. The Parthenon in Greece
8. The Pyramids of Giza
9. The Taj Mahal in India
10. The Eiffel Tower in France
11. The Statue of Liberty in the USA
12. The Sydney Opera House in Australia
13. The Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy
14. The Sagrada Familia in Spain
15. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai
16. The Angkor Wat in Cambodia
17. The Petra in Jordan
18. The Moai statues on Easter Island
19. The Alhambra in Spain
20. The Forbidden City in China
21. The St. Basil's Cathedral in Russia
22. The Golden Gate Bridge in the USA
23. The Machu Picchu terraces in Peru
24. The Acropolis in Greece

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
