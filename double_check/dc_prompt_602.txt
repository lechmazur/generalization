Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical rituals involving direct contact with fire as a central element of a traditional, localized religious or spiritual practice.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. walking barefoot over hot coals during a fire-walking ceremony
2. lighting a sacred fire and passing offerings through its flames as part of a harvest ritual
3. holding burning torches while performing a ceremonial dance around a bonfire
4. placing hands directly into a sacred flame to receive blessings during a purification rite

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. lighting candles on a birthday cake
6. burning incense sticks during meditation
7. using a fireplace to warm a home
8. roasting marshmallows over a campfire
9. lighting a lantern during a festival
10. burning sage for smudging rituals
11. using a blowtorch for metalworking
12. lighting fireworks during a celebration
13. burning a yule log during Christmas
14. using a Bunsen burner in a science lab
15. lighting a menorah during Hanukkah
16. burning old documents for disposal
17. using a candle to light a dark room
18. burning a effigy during a protest
19. lighting a match to start a stove
20. burning leaves in a backyard fire pit
21. using a lighter to ignite a cigarette
22. lighting a candle during a vigil
23. burning a piece of paper for artistic purposes
24. using a flame to sterilize a needle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
