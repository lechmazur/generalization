Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional practices or tools that use natural materials to enhance sensory experiences in specific cultural or environmental contexts.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Inuit crafting of snow goggles from bone or wood with narrow slits to reduce glare and enhance contrast in snowy landscapes.
2. Amazonian tribes using aromatic plant resins and barks in ritualistic smoking ceremonies to induce altered states of consciousness and connect with the spiritual realm.
3. Pacific Islander communities creating shell trumpets and drums using natural materials like shells, wood, and animal hides for communication, ceremonies, and storytelling.
4. Saharan nomadic groups weaving intricate grass mats and shelters that provide shade, ventilation, and tactile comfort in the desert environment.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A synthetic tapestry depicting a nature scene.
6. A digital recording of birdsong played through speakers.
7. A plastic rain stick filled with metal beads.
8. A photograph of a sunset.
9. A concrete sculpture shaped like a tree.
10. A glass bottle filled with sand from a beach.
11. A metal wind chime.
12. A synthetic essential oil diffuser.
13. A plastic toy shaped like a musical instrument.
14. A video game depicting a natural environment.
15. A book about the history of perfume.
16. A painting of a flower garden.
17. A metal sculpture of a bird.
18. A plastic replica of a seashell.
19. A recording of ocean waves played on a loop.
20. A synthetic fur rug.
21. A glass paperweight containing a dried flower.
22. A digital image of a starry night sky.
23. A plastic bird feeder.
24. A metal garden gnome.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
