Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): 1980s female pop artists known for their distinctive vocal styles and colorful fashion

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Madonna
2. Cyndi Lauper
3. Annie Lennox
4. Kate Bush

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Elton John
6. David Bowie
7. Prince
8. Michael Jackson
9. Whitney Houston
10. Cher
11. Dolly Parton
12. Stevie Nicks
13. Freddie Mercury
14. George Michael
15. Janet Jackson
16. Tina Turner
17. Boy George
18. Phil Collins
19. Sting
20. Bonnie Tyler
21. Pat Benatar
22. Linda Ronstadt
23. Grace Jones
24. Debbie Harry

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
