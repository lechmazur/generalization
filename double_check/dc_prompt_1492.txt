Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artificial systems designed to maintain dormant organisms in suspended animation for extended periods while preventing tissue damage

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cryogenic storage tanks for embryo preservation
2. Hypothermic perfusion machines for organ transplants
3. Seed bank cooling chambers with moisture control
4. Bacterial spore preservation units with temperature regulation

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Refrigerators
6. Hibernation dens
7. Tree hollows
8. Underground burrows
9. Ice caves
10. Permafrost layers
11. Vacuum sealed containers
12. Dehydration chambers
13. Freezer units
14. Incubators
15. Climate controlled vaults
16. Time capsules
17. Preservation jars
18. Sealed terrariums
19. Hyperbaric chambers
20. Life support systems
21. Pressure vessels
22. Anaerobic chambers
23. Growth chambers
24. Specimen storage boxes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
