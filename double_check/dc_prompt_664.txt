Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or designs that incorporate swirling patterns to create a sense of dynamic movement and depth, often using contrasting colors to enhance the visual effect.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a spiral galaxy painting
2. a vinyl record with a colorful marbled design
3. a whirlpool-inspired glass sculpture
4. a tie-dye shirt with concentric swirls

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a checkerboard pattern
6. a zebra's stripes
7. a honeycomb structure
8. a brick wall
9. a straight-line graph
10. a polka-dot dress
11. a grid of squares
12. a herringbone fabric
13. a mosaic tile floor
14. a bar code
15. a plaid shirt
16. a pinstripe suit
17. a leopard's spots
18. a tree's bark texture
19. a fingerprint
20. a starry night sky
21. a crossword puzzle
22. a ladder
23. a chain-link fence
24. a waffle pattern

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
