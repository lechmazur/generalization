Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or locations named after animals that are not directly related to the animal's physical characteristics or habitat.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Bull and Bear Pub
2. Swansea City football club
3. The White Horse Inn
4. The Dolphin Shopping Centre

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Penguin Books
6. Dove soap
7. The Eagles band
8. Puma sportswear
9. Cobra beer
10. The Rams football team
11. The Hornets basketball team
12. The Bears baseball team
13. The Lions rugby team
14. The Tigers cricket team
15. Crocodile Dundee film
16. The Black Stallion book
17. The Fox and the Hound movie
18. Eagle Scout award
19. The Greyhound bus company
20. Caterpillar construction equipment
21. Seagull outboard motors
22. The Lobster Shack restaurant
23. The Elephant Sanctuary
24. The Monkey House zoo enclosure

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
