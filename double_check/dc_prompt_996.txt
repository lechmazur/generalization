Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places or objects that are hidden or revealed through the cessation of a repetitive or cyclical sound or motion.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A secret door behind a grandfather clock that swings open when the pendulum stops.
2. A hidden compartment in a washing machine revealed when the drum ceases spinning.
3. A message written in the sand that becomes visible when the tide recedes.
4. A flickering light bulb illuminating a hidden passage when the flickering stops.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A treasure chest buried under an X.
6. A hidden message in a bottle.
7. A secret room behind a bookcase.
8. A coded message revealed under UV light.
9. A hidden microphone in a lamp.
10. A spy camera disguised as a pen.
11. A secret passage behind a waterfall.
12. A hidden compartment in a car's dashboard.
13. A message written in invisible ink.
14. A treasure map found in an attic.
15. A hidden key under a doormat.
16. A secret knock to enter a speakeasy.
17. A false bottom in a suitcase.
18. A hidden compartment in a shoe.
19. A secret tunnel under a castle.
20. A hidden message in a painting.
21. A secret code in a book.
22. A hidden room accessed by a rotating wall panel.
23. A disguised listening device in a teddy bear.
24. A secret compartment revealed by a specific sequence of button presses.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
