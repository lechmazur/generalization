Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Pre-Columbian artifacts made from volcanic glass used in religious ceremonies

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. An obsidian blade used for ritual bloodletting in Aztec ceremonies
2. A Mayan figurine carved from obsidian, representing a deity associated with agriculture and fertility
3. An obsidian mirror used by an Olmec shaman for divination and communication with the spirit world
4. A Teotihuacan mask inlaid with obsidian eyes, worn during funerary rites

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A clay pot used for cooking maize
6. A gold pendant worn by a Mayan ruler
7. A feather headdress used in Aztec dances
8. A stone carving depicting a Chavin deity
9. A turquoise mosaic adorning a Moche mask
10. A bone flute played during Inca ceremonies
11. A cotton textile woven with intricate patterns
12. A ceramic vessel used for storing chicha
13. A wooden mask representing a Northwest Coast spirit
14. A copper ornament found in a Hopewell burial mound
15. An obsidian arrowhead used for hunting
16. An obsidian scraper used for hide working
17. A volcanic rock used in construction
18. A piece of jade carved into a pendant
19. A shell ornament used in a burial ritual
20. A quartz crystal used for healing
21. A Nazca geoglyph depicting a hummingbird
22. A painted mural depicting a Mayan myth
23. A stone altar used for sacrifices
24. A ceremonial mace made of wood and stone

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
