Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring mineral deposits that serve as both wildlife sanctuaries and economic resources in southern Africa

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Jwaneng Diamond Mine
2. Venetia Diamond Mine
3. Palabora Copper Mine
4. Sishen Iron Ore Mine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Great Barrier Reef
6. Kruger National Park
7. Table Mountain
8. Kalahari Desert
9. Victoria Falls
10. Namib Desert
11. Okavango Delta
12. Drakensberg Mountains
13. Zambezi River
14. Etosha Salt Pan
15. Kimberley Big Hole
16. Cradle of Humankind
17. Blyde River Canyon
18. Tsodilo Hills
19. Makgadikgadi Pan
20. Cango Caves
21. Fish River Canyon
22. Richtersveld Desert
23. Mapungubwe National Park
24. iSimangaliso Wetland Park

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
