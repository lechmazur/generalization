Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional fishing techniques that rely on interpreting animal behavior patterns to predict fish locations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Following flocks of seabirds to locate schools of fish near the surface.
2. Observing the movements of dolphins or other marine mammals to pinpoint tuna or other predatory fish.
3. Identifying subtle changes in water turbidity caused by bottom-feeding fish stirring up sediment.
4. Recognizing specific insect hatches that attract fish to the surface for feeding.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Using sonar technology to map the seabed and locate fish aggregations.
6. Trolling with multiple lines to cover a wider area and attract different species.
7. Employing longline fishing with hundreds of baited hooks to catch pelagic fish.
8. Casting nets from shore to capture fish in shallow waters.
9. Using fish finders to identify water temperature and depth preferences of target species.
10. Drift netting with large nets to passively catch fish carried by currents.
11. Bottom trawling with weighted nets to catch demersal fish on the seafloor.
12. Jigging with artificial lures to mimic the movements of prey fish.
13. Setting traps or pots baited with attractants to capture crustaceans and shellfish.
14. Using chum to create a feeding frenzy and attract fish to a specific location.
15. Studying migration patterns of fish using tagging and tracking technology.
16. Analyzing stomach contents of caught fish to understand their dietary preferences.
17. Monitoring water quality parameters like salinity and oxygen levels to identify suitable fish habitats.
18. Using underwater cameras to observe fish behavior and distribution.
19. Applying mathematical models to predict fish stock abundance and distribution.
20. Developing artificial reefs to enhance fish habitat and promote biodiversity.
21. Implementing fishing regulations to manage fish populations and prevent overfishing.
22. Using gillnets to entangle fish by their gills.
23. Electrofishing to stun fish for capture in research or management activities.
24. Using dynamite fishing to kill or stun fish for easy collection (illegal and destructive).

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
