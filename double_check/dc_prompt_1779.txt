Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Victorian-era inspired transportation methods that incorporate divination practices

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fortune-telling hansom cab with tarot-reading driver
2. Crystal ball-guided penny-farthing bicycle
3. Steam locomotive with built-in tea leaf reading compartment
4. Horse-drawn omnibus with astrological navigation system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Modern subway car with palm reader
6. Horse-drawn carriage
7. Steam locomotive
8. Crystal ball on display
9. Tarot card reading room
10. Victorian walking stick
11. Fortune teller's wagon
12. Electric tram
13. Ouija board parlor
14. Penny-farthing bicycle
15. Gypsy caravan
16. Canal boat
17. Astrology chart
18. Sedan chair
19. Railway station
20. Fortune telling booth
21. Hansom cab
22. Tea room
23. Hot air balloon
24. Stagecoach

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
