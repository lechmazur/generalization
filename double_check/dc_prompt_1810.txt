Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Early 20th-century inventions that significantly influenced visual storytelling

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Lumi√®re Brothers' cinematograph
2. Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope
3. George Eastman's roll film camera
4. The Technicolor process

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The printing press
6. The radio
7. The phonograph
8. The steam engine
9. The electric light bulb
10. The telephone
11. The airplane
12. The assembly line
13. The refrigerator
14. The television
15. The computer
16. The internet
17. The smartphone
18. The digital camera
19. The video cassette recorder
20. The compact disc
21. The microwave oven
22. The air conditioner
23. The washing machine
24. The elevator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
