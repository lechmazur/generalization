Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific or technological breakthroughs that were initially dismissed as hoaxes by mainstream publications or academic institutions but were later proven genuine within the discoverer's lifetime

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Wright brothers' first powered flight in 1903
2. Semmelweis's handwashing theory preventing childbed fever in 1847
3. Marshall and Warren's discovery that H. pylori bacteria cause ulcers in 1982
4. Wegener's continental drift theory proposed in 1912

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Galileo's heliocentric model of the solar system
6. Darwin's theory of evolution
7. Cold fusion announcement by Pons and Fleischmann
8. N-rays claimed by Ren√© Blondlot
9. The Cardiff Giant discovery
10. Piltdown Man fossil finding
11. Tesla's wireless power transmission
12. Einstein's theory of relativity
13. Mendel's laws of inheritance
14. The discovery of X-rays
15. Pasteur's germ theory
16. Discovery of nuclear fission
17. Kepler's laws of planetary motion
18. The discovery of penicillin
19. Planck's quantum theory
20. Maxwell's electromagnetic theory
21. Bohr's atomic model
22. Copernicus's astronomical observations
23. Mesmer's animal magnetism theory
24. Jenner's smallpox vaccination

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
