Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made from plant fibers that have been used for communication or documentation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Papyrus scroll
2. Hemp rope used for knot tying records
3. Amatl bark paper codex
4. Washi paper used for calligraphy

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Clay tablet
6. Stone inscription
7. Parchment manuscript
8. Woven silk tapestry depicting a historical event
9. Metal printing plate
10. Photographic film
11. Magnetic tape
12. Bamboo flute
13. Cotton shirt
14. Linen bed sheets
15. Wooden printing block
16. Sisal rug
17. Jute bag
18. Coconut shell bowl
19. Palm leaf fan
20. Digital document
21. Email
22. Voice recording
23. Video recording
24. Cave painting

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
