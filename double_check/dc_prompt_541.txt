Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that depict fictional maps with at least one deliberate, artistic imperfection.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a hand-drawn map of Middle-earth with a river flowing uphill
2. a fantasy city map where the streets form an impossible geometric pattern
3. a treasure map with a mountain range that loops back on itself
4. a fictional island map with a coastline that changes shape depending on the angle viewed

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a globe
6. a topographic map
7. a subway map
8. a world atlas
9. a GPS navigation device
10. a road map
11. a star chart
12. a weather map
13. a nautical chart
14. a political map
15. a city blueprint
16. a geological map
17. a historical map
18. a treasure chest
19. a compass
20. a map pin
21. a map scale
22. a map legend
23. a map projection
24. a map case

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
