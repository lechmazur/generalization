Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places where retired or obsolete entertainment equipment is permanently displayed and maintained for historical preservation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland
2. National Pinball Museum in Baltimore
3. Computer Game Museum in Berlin
4. Museum of the Game in San Francisco

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Dave & Buster's arcade
6. Universal Studios theme park
7. A private collector's game room
8. Circus World Museum
9. Broadway theater storage warehouse
10. Disney animation archives
11. Las Vegas casino floor
12. Hollywood prop warehouse
13. Antique toy store
14. Film restoration facility
15. Amusement park maintenance shed
16. Television studio equipment room
17. Concert venue storage facility
18. Movie theater projection booth
19. Carnival equipment yard
20. Stage lighting rental company
21. Recording studio gear closet
22. Theater costume department
23. Radio station equipment room
24. Gaming convention display hall

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
