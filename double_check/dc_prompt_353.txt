Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems designed to accelerate the movement of specific entities through a predetermined, complex, non-linear path.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A software program designed to optimize the routing of data packets through a computer network.
2. A series of specialized conveyor belts and automated guided vehicles within a manufacturing plant, designed to move components through various assembly stations in a specific order.
3. A system of locks, canals, and dams engineered to facilitate the passage of ships through a waterway with varying elevations.
4. A protein folding chaperone molecule that guides a nascent polypeptide chain through the complex process of achieving its functional three-dimensional structure.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A highway system.
6. A train track.
7. A water slide.
8. An assembly line for a single product.
9. A pipeline for oil or gas.
10. A mail sorting system.
11. A blood vessel.
12. A nerve fiber.
13. An airport runway.
14. A rollercoaster.
15. A logistics company's delivery network.
16. A river.
17. An escalator.
18. A queueing system at a bank.
19. A supply chain for a retail store.
20. The digestive system.
21. An air traffic control system.
22. A conveyor belt for luggage at an airport.
23. A subway system.
24. A food delivery service.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
