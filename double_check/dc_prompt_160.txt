Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems that temporarily store kinetic energy from cyclical processes to smooth out power delivery or improve efficiency

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Flywheel energy storage system
2. Regenerative braking in electric vehicles
3. Pumped hydroelectric energy storage
4. Compressed air energy storage

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Solar panels
6. Wind turbines
7. Battery storage systems
8. Geothermal power plants
9. Hydroelectric dams
10. Coal-fired power plants
11. Nuclear reactors
12. Natural gas turbines
13. Biomass energy systems
14. Wave energy converters
15. Tidal power stations
16. Electric grid transformers
17. Diesel generators
18. Photovoltaic cells
19. Hydrogen fuel cells
20. Steam turbines
21. Capacitor banks
22. Thermal energy storage
23. Biogas digesters
24. Electric heaters

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
