Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic expressions that caused significant public controversy or backlash at their initial presentation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sergei Eisenstein's film "Battleship Potemkin" (1925)
2. Andres Serrano's photograph "Piss Christ" (1987)
3. Chris Ofili's painting "The Holy Virgin Mary" (1996)
4. Dennis Cooper's novel "Frisk" (1991)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Beatles' album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" (1967)
6. Picasso's painting "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" (1907)
7. James Joyce's novel "Ulysses" (1922)
8. Salvador Dal√≠'s painting "The Persistence of Memory" (1931)
9. Bob Dylan's electric performance at the Newport Folk Festival (1965)
10. Marcel Duchamp's "Fountain" (1917)
11. Stravinsky's ballet "The Rite of Spring" (1913)
12. Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 (1824)
13. Jackson Pollock's drip paintings (1940s-1950s)
14. Elvis Presley's performance on The Ed Sullivan Show (1956)
15. The Sex Pistols' single "God Save the Queen" (1977)
16. Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup Cans (1962)
17. The film "The Exorcist" (1973)
18. The musical "Hair" (1967)
19. The film "A Clockwork Orange" (1971)
20. The novel "Lolita" by Vladimir Nabokov (1955)
21. The film "The Last Temptation of Christ" (1988)
22. The play "Angels in America" by Tony Kushner (1991)
23. The film "Brokeback Mountain" (2005)
24. The television show "All in the Family" (1971-1979)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
