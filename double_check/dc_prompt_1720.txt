Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): antique mechanical devices used for automated entertainment

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Silver Swan Automaton
2. Draughtsman-Writer
3. A table-top sized mechanical orchestra
4. A wind-up toy depicting acrobats

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A player piano
6. A music box
7. A zoetrope
8. A steam engine
9. A loom
10. A clockwork calculator
11. A telescope
12. A phonograph
13. A telegraph
14. A sewing machine
15. An astrolabe
16. A printing press
17. A typewriter
18. A wind-up toy car
19. A cuckoo clock
20. A water wheel
21. An automaton designed for factory work
22. A mechanical bird used for hunting
23. A miniature steam train
24. A mechanical doll that cries

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
