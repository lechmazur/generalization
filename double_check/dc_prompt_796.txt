Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Biological entities that rely on symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient acquisition in nutrient-poor environments.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Orchids
2. Ericaceous plants like blueberries
3. Monotropoid plants such as Indian pipe
4. Certain species of liverworts

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bacteria in the human gut
6. Clownfish and sea anemones
7. Lichens
8. Mycorrhizal fungi and trees
9. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legume roots
10. Cleaner fish and larger marine animals
11. Ants and aphids
12. Termites and gut protozoa
13. Corals and zooxanthellae
14. Oxpeckers and large mammals
15. Fungi decomposing dead wood
16. Parasitic plants like mistletoe
17. Bioluminescent bacteria in squid
18. Fungi forming lichens with algae
19. Bees pollinating flowers
20. Fungi infecting insects
21. Fungi breaking down leaf litter
22. Fungi producing antibiotics
23. Fungi causing plant diseases
24. Fungi forming fairy rings

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
