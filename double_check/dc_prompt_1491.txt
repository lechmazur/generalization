Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices that automatically monitor and regulate bodily functions through closed-loop feedback systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. artificial pancreas system
2. implantable cardioverter defibrillator
3. closed-loop deep brain stimulator
4. automated insulin pump with continuous glucose monitoring

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. heart rate monitor watch
6. blood pressure cuff
7. thermometer
8. pulse oximeter
9. mechanical ventilator
10. hearing aid
11. pacemaker without feedback
12. prosthetic leg
13. dialysis machine
14. CPAP machine
15. fitness tracker
16. ECG monitor
17. insulin pen
18. cochlear implant
19. blood glucose meter
20. infusion pump
21. nerve stimulator
22. artificial heart
23. robotic prosthetic arm
24. spinal cord stimulator

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
