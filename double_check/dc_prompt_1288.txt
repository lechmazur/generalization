Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): objects or artifacts that embody cultural or personal significance but are visibly damaged or altered, reflecting a narrative of loss, transformation, or resilience

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a cracked porcelain doll with a missing arm
2. a faded family photograph with torn edges
3. a war-torn flag with bullet holes
4. a rusted pocket watch with a broken face

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a brand-new wedding ring
6. a pristine museum artifact
7. a freshly painted mural
8. a modern smartphone
9. a newly printed book
10. a flawless diamond necklace
11. a recently carved wooden sculpture
12. a factory-sealed vinyl record
13. a just-released video game
14. a mint-condition comic book
15. a newly built house
16. a freshly baked loaf of bread
17. a recently planted tree
18. a brand-new car
19. a just-opened bottle of wine
20. a newly designed fashion dress
21. a recently discovered fossil
22. a freshly minted coin
23. a just-released movie
24. a newly constructed bridge

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
