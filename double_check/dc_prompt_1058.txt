Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or man-made structures that exhibit fractal-like patterns at multiple scales and are named after organic or biological entities.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Romanesco broccoli
2. Snowflake formations
3. Tree-like river deltas
4. Lung bronchial structures

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Eiffel Tower
6. Great Wall of China
7. Golden Gate Bridge
8. Mount Everest
9. Grand Canyon
10. Niagara Falls
11. Burj Khalifa
12. Stonehenge
13. Machu Picchu
14. Colosseum
15. Pyramids of Giza
16. Amazon Rainforest
17. Great Barrier Reef
18. Victoria Falls
19. Mount Fuji
20. Yellowstone National Park
21. Statue of Liberty
22. Angkor Wat
23. Petra
24. Christ the Redeemer

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
