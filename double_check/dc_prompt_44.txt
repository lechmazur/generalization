Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Antique wicker picnic hampers specifically designed to carry bottled beverages.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Vintage woven hamper with a dedicated compartment for wine bottles
2. Early 20th-century wicker basket designed with insulated sections for champagne
3. Antique picnic hamper featuring a removable cooler for beer bottles
4. 1930s wicker picnic set with a built-in rack for holding soda bottles

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Modern insulated cooler bag for beverages
6. Plastic picnic basket with a section for snacks
7. Contemporary wicker hamper without specific beverage compartments
8. Metal ice bucket for chilling drinks
9. Wooden picnic box with utensils but no beverage storage
10. Leather satchel designed for carrying food
11. Canvas tote bag for general picnic use
12. Stainless steel flask for personal drink consumption
13. Glass pitcher for serving beverages at picnics
14. Portable barbecue grill for outdoor cooking
15. Folding picnic table for outdoor dining
16. Disposable picnic set with plastic cutlery
17. Backpack cooler for hiking trips
18. Beach bag designed for carrying towels and sunscreen
19. Travel mug for keeping beverages hot or cold
20. Reusable water bottle for hydration on the go
21. Collapsible silicone container for food storage
22. Portable blender for making smoothies outdoors
23. Electric picnic blanket with built-in speakers
24. Outdoor seating cushion for comfort during picnics

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
