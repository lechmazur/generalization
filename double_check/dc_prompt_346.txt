Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for outdoor use that incorporate natural plant fibers in their construction.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A woven wicker patio chair with a bamboo frame
2. A hanging planter made from coconut fiber
3. A woven seagrass beach bag with jute handles
4. A garden trellis made from willow branches

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A plastic Adirondack chair
6. A metal garden gnome
7. A cedar wood picnic table
8. A concrete birdbath
9. A wrought iron garden gate
10. A ceramic flower pot
11. A glass hummingbird feeder
12. A canvas camping tent
13. A nylon hammock
14. A polyester outdoor rug
15. An inflatable pool toy
16. A wooden birdhouse
17. A metal toolbox
18. A plastic watering can
19. A rubber garden hose
20. A fiberglass planter box
21. A stone garden statue
22. A steel fire pit
23. An aluminum lawn chair
24. A teak outdoor bench

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
