Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tactile writing systems created before 1900 that were officially adopted by at least one government or institution

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Braille
2. Moon type
3. New York Point
4. Boston Line Type

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Morse code
6. Semaphore
7. Sign language
8. American Braille
9. Unified English Braille
10. Shorthand
11. ASCII
12. Binary code
13. Hieroglyphics
14. Cuneiform
15. International Phonetic Alphabet
16. Finger spelling
17. Optical Character Recognition
18. QR code
19. Bar code
20. SignWriting
21. Blissymbols
22. Haptic communication
23. Knotted cords (Quipu)
24. Semaphore flags

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
