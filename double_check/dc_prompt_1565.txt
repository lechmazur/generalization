Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional medicinal plants that were later found to contain compounds now used in modern prescription antidepressants

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. St. John's Wort
2. Turmeric
3. Rhodiola rosea
4. Saffron

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ginseng
6. Chamomile
7. Lavender
8. Echinacea
9. Ginkgo biloba
10. Valerian root
11. Peppermint
12. Garlic
13. Milk thistle
14. Aloe vera
15. Feverfew
16. Licorice root
17. Yarrow
18. Hawthorn
19. Black cohosh
20. Evening primrose
21. Red clover
22. Goldenseal
23. Catnip
24. Passionflower

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
