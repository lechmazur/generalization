Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Heavy metal objects used in traditional strength competitions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Atlas stone
2. Farmer's walk implements
3. Yoke
4. Conan's wheel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Barbell
6. Dumbbell
7. Kettlebell
8. Weight plate
9. Medicine ball
10. Sandbag
11. Weightlifting belt
12. Gymnastic rings
13. Pull-up bar
14. Rowing machine
15. Treadmill
16. Elliptical trainer
17. Stationary bike
18. Jump rope
19. Resistance band
20. Bench press
21. Squat rack
22. Deadlift platform
23. Power rack
24. Smith machine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
