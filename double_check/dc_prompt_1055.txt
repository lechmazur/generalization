Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Processes or systems that involve the transformation or repurposing of materials or signals at the end of their primary lifecycle, often requiring specialized infrastructure or technology.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Recycling of plastic bottles into polyester fabric
2. Converting food waste into biogas through anaerobic digestion
3. Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to extract usable uranium and plutonium
4. Transforming sewage sludge into biosolids for agricultural use

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Composting yard waste
6. Donating used clothes
7. Refilling ink cartridges
8. Repairing a broken appliance
9. Upcycling furniture
10. Melting down gold jewelry to create new pieces
11. Using scrap wood for firewood
12. Grinding coffee beans
13. Squeezing oranges for juice
14. Filtering water
15. Distilling alcohol
16. Photosynthesis
17. Digestion
18. Data compression
19. Signal amplification
20. Translating languages
21. Encrypting data
22. Burning coal for electricity
23. Building a house from lumber
24. Weaving fabric from yarn

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
