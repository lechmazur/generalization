Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geographical locations named after European explorers that are primarily known for their unique marine ecosystems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Cook Islands
2. The Tasman Sea
3. Hudson Bay
4. The Strait of Magellan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Vancouver Island
6. Newfoundland
7. The Amazon River
8. The Galapagos Islands
9. Mount Everest
10. The Grand Canyon
11. The Sahara Desert
12. Lake Victoria
13. The Nile River
14. The Bering Strait
15. Drake Passage
16. The English Channel
17. The Bay of Biscay
18. The Gulf of Mexico
19. The Caribbean Sea
20. The Mediterranean Sea
21. The Baltic Sea
22. The North Sea
23. The Norwegian Sea
24. The Barents Sea

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
