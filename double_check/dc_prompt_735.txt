Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Individuals who have significantly influenced a field or culture and have names that are commonly used as code names or project names in technology or military operations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Enigma
2. Apollo
3. Da Vinci
4. Odyssey

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Thunder
6. Eclipse
7. Horizon
8. Neptune
9. Genesis
10. Phantom
11. Comet
12. Galaxy
13. Storm
14. Blizzard
15. Firefly
16. Twilight
17. Serenity
18. Oracle
19. Tempest
20. Zephyr
21. Nova
22. Spectre
23. Harrier
24. Meridian

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
