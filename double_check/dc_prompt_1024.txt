Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or practices that incorporate protective or symbolic barriers to separate the sacred or dangerous from the mundane or vulnerable.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a mezuzah affixed to a doorframe
2. a protective circle drawn during a ritual
3. a tabernacle veil in a church
4. a moat surrounding a castle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wedding ring
6. a traffic cone
7. a security camera
8. a fire extinguisher
9. a lighthouse
10. a scarecrow
11. a lock on a door
12. a life jacket
13. a vaccination
14. a helmet
15. a fence around a garden
16. a password-protected account
17. a seatbelt
18. a smoke detector
19. a guard dog
20. a privacy screen
21. a warning sign
22. a raincoat
23. a security guard
24. a fire alarm

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
