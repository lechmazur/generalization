Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments designed to be played with more than ten fingers simultaneously.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. pipe organ
2. carillon
3. theater organ
4. barrel organ

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. piano
6. harpsichord
7. accordion
8. guitar
9. violin
10. drum set
11. synthesizer
12. xylophone
13. marimba
14. harp
15. cello
16. clarinet
17. flute
18. trumpet
19. dulcimer
20. banjo
21. mandolin
22. ukulele
23. bassoon
24. timpani

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
