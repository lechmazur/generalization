Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artisanal tools or structures that amplify or transform natural elements through human craftsmanship, often requiring precise, repetitive motion or technique.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. bellows
2. water wheel
3. potter's wheel
4. spinning wheel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. hammer
6. sundial
7. compass
8. telescope
9. windmill
10. chisel
11. loom
12. anvil
13. mortar and pestle
14. pulley
15. forge
16. kiln
17. weathervane
18. hand pump
19. grinding stone
20. saw
21. rake
22. sieve
23. bucket
24. axe

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
