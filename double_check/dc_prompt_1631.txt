Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring phenomena that create sustained, audible frequencies below 20 Hz while maintaining a consistent rhythm

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ocean waves breaking on a beach
2. volcanic tremors
3. glacier movement
4. wind through mountain passes

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. thunder
6. whale songs
7. waterfall sounds
8. earthquake vibrations
9. wind chimes
10. tree branches creaking
11. subway rumbling
12. helicopter blades
13. diesel engine idling
14. church bells
15. avalanche
16. rain on a roof
17. geysers erupting
18. rock slides
19. cave echoes
20. tectonic plate movement
21. meteor entry sounds
22. aurora sounds
23. forest fire roaring
24. ice cracking

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
