Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geometric shapes that are truncations of regular polychora in four-dimensional space

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Truncated 16-cell
2. Truncated 24-cell
3. Bitruncated 5-cell
4. Cantitruncated tesseract

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Cube
6. Tetrahedron
7. Octahedron
8. Dodecahedron
9. Icosahedron
10. Rhombicuboctahedron
11. Truncated cube
12. Cuboctahedron
13. Snub cube
14. Triangular prism
15. Square pyramid
16. Pentagonal antiprism
17. Tesseract
18. 16-cell
19. 24-cell
20. 120-cell
21. 600-cell
22. Runcinated 5-cell
23. Omnitruncated 24-cell
24. Rectified 120-cell

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
