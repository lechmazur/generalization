Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): things named after people that are not directly related to the person's primary field of expertise or fame

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Graham cracker
2. The Diesel engine
3. The Salisbury steak
4. The Bunsen burner

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Nobel Prize
6. The Pulitzer Prize
7. The Tesla car
8. The Ford Motor Company
9. The Edison light bulb
10. The Darwin Awards
11. The Curie point
12. The Newton's cradle
13. The Pasteurization process
14. The Braille system
15. The Morse code
16. The Fahrenheit scale
17. The Richter scale
18. The Hubble Space Telescope
19. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle
20. The Freudian slip
21. The Pavlovian response
22. The Machiavellian tactics
23. The Orwellian surveillance
24. The Kafkaesque situation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
