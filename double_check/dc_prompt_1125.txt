Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or devices that convert one form of energy into another through mechanical vibration or resonance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ultrasonic humidifier
2. Tuning fork
3. Piezoelectric speaker
4. Resonant transformer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Solar panel
6. Electric motor
7. Wind turbine
8. Battery
9. Light bulb
10. Microphone
11. Generator
12. Heat pump
13. Fuel cell
14. Photovoltaic cell
15. Thermoelectric generator
16. Hydraulic system
17. Steam engine
18. Gas turbine
19. Internal combustion engine
20. Electric heater
21. Refrigerator
22. Air conditioner
23. Radio transmitter
24. Laser

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
