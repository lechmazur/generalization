Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects worn around the waist that are primarily decorative and made from animal materials

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a beaded leather belt
2. a feathered waist sash
3. a snakeskin waist cincher
4. a fur-trimmed decorative girdle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a leather jacket
6. a wool scarf
7. a silk necktie
8. a cotton apron
9. a metal belt buckle
10. a feather boa
11. a fur coat
12. a beaded necklace
13. a leather wallet
14. a wool sweater
15. a silk handkerchief
16. a cotton headband
17. a metal chain bracelet
18. a feather headdress
19. a fur hat
20. a beaded bracelet
21. a leather handbag
22. a wool beanie
23. a silk sash
24. a cotton belt

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
