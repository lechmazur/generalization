Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Culinary preparation methods that require ingredients to be arranged in concentric circles before cooking begins

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ratatouille
2. Galette des Rois
3. Pizza Margherita
4. Paella Valenciana

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Grilled cheese sandwich
6. Beef Wellington
7. Lasagna
8. Stir-fried vegetables
9. Roast chicken
10. Spaghetti Bolognese
11. Caesar salad
12. Fried rice
13. Chicken curry
14. Hamburger
15. Quiche Lorraine
16. Shepherd's pie
17. Clam chowder
18. Fish and chips
19. Eggs Benedict
20. Beef stew
21. Apple pie
22. French toast
23. Chicken pot pie
24. Macaroni and cheese

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
