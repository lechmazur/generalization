Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Japanese yokai that transform into or mimic everyday household objects when attacking humans

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a teapot that suddenly sprouts limbs and chases its owner
2. a folding fan that unfurls into a monstrous creature
3. a lantern that reveals a sinister face and floats menacingly
4. a futon that wraps around and suffocates its sleeper

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a kappa lurking near a river
6. a kitsune transforming into a human
7. a tengu perched on a mountain
8. a oni wielding a giant club
9. a nekomata with a forked tail
10. a rokurokubi stretching its neck
11. a nurikabe blocking a path
12. a tsuchinoko slithering through grass
13. a yuki-onna appearing in a snowstorm
14. a kasa-obake hopping on one leg
15. a zashiki-warashi playing pranks
16. a umibozu rising from the sea
17. a shirime exposing its eye
18. a bake-danuki shapeshifting into a tree
19. a hitotsume-kozo with a single eye
20. a kamaitachi slicing through the air
21. a gashadokuro towering over villages
22. a mokumokuren watching from walls
23. a wanyudo rolling as a flaming wheel
24. a kudan predicting disasters

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
