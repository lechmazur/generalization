Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools and techniques used by indigenous peoples for hunting in cold climates

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. bone-tipped harpoon
2. sinew-backed bow
3. caribou snare
4. seal scratcher

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. fishing net
6. stone axe
7. bamboo spear
8. wooden club
9. obsidian knife
10. leather sling
11. blowgun
12. pit trap
13. throwing stick
14. reed basket
15. clay pot
16. woven rope
17. fire starter
18. wooden canoe
19. stone hammer
20. bone needle
21. shell scraper
22. grass net
23. wooden bow drill
24. stone mortar

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
