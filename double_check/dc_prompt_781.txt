Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that facilitate communication by converting analog signals to digital data

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a modem
2. a digital telephone system
3. a voice-over-IP (VoIP) device
4. a digital radio transmitter

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a smartphone
6. a satellite dish
7. a fiber optic cable
8. a Bluetooth headset
9. a Wi-Fi router
10. a microphone
11. a speaker
12. a television remote
13. a webcam
14. a GPS device
15. a smartwatch
16. a landline telephone
17. a walkie-talkie
18. a fax machine
19. a radio antenna
20. a soundbar
21. a hearing aid
22. a video conferencing app
23. a streaming device
24. a barcode scanner

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
