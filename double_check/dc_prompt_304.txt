Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate a functional pendulum or swinging component within their primary structure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A grandfather clock
2. A metronome
3. A swing set
4. A wrecking ball

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A ceiling fan
6. A yo-yo
7. A Newton's cradle
8. A pendulum ride at an amusement park
9. A rocking chair
10. A seesaw
11. A trebuchet
12. A bell
13. A slinky
14. A pogo stick
15. A tire swing
16. A hammock
17. A jump rope
18. A balance scale
19. A wind chime
20. A mobile (hanging sculpture)
21. A clothesline with clothes hanging
22. A chandelier
23. A trapeze
24. A punching bag

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
