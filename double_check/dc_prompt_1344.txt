Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): biological adaptations in extreme environments that involve unique molecular or structural modifications

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The production of antifreeze proteins in the blood of Antarctic icefish to prevent freezing in subzero waters.
2. The evolution of specialized rhodopsins in deep-sea hydrothermal vent tube worms to detect faint infrared light emitted from the vents.
3. The synthesis of heat-shock proteins by thermophilic bacteria living in hot springs to protect their cellular machinery from thermal denaturation.
4. The development of DNA repair mechanisms in Deinococcus radiodurans that allow it to withstand extreme levels of radiation.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Migration of birds to warmer climates during winter.
6. Hibernation of bears during winter.
7. Desert animals being nocturnal to avoid the heat.
8. Camouflage of animals in their environment.
9. A plant growing towards sunlight.
10. The thick fur of arctic foxes.
11. The large ears of desert foxes for heat dissipation.
12. Webbed feet of ducks for swimming.
13. Echolocation in bats.
14. The streamlined body shape of dolphins.
15. The sharp claws of eagles.
16. The long neck of giraffes.
17. The prehensile tail of monkeys.
18. The venom of snakes.
19. The bright colors of poison dart frogs.
20. The mimicry of viceroy butterflies.
21. The development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
22. The evolution of pesticide resistance in insects.
23. Succulents storing water in their leaves.
24. Deciduous trees shedding their leaves in autumn.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
