Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional characters who serve as double agents within a magical or supernatural organization

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a spy who infiltrates a coven of witches while secretly working for a rival magical faction
2. a shapeshifter who poses as a loyal member of a supernatural council but reports to an ancient dragon
3. a mage who joins a secret society of sorcerers while secretly aiding a rogue demon
4. a vampire who infiltrates a werewolf pack's inner circle while secretly serving a shadowy necromancer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a detective solving supernatural crimes
6. a wizard who trains young apprentices
7. a ghost haunting a magical library
8. a werewolf leading a pack in the wilderness
9. a fairy granting wishes to humans
10. a dragon guarding a treasure hoard
11. a witch brewing potions in a hidden cottage
12. a vampire hunter tracking down rogue vampires
13. a necromancer raising an army of undead
14. a time traveler altering magical history
15. a cursed pirate sailing supernatural seas
16. a magical artifact collector searching for rare items
17. a shapeshifter living in disguise among humans
18. a sorcerer battling a rival in a magical duel
19. a demon bound to serve a mortal master
20. a prophet foreseeing magical disasters
21. a guardian spirit protecting a sacred forest
22. a rogue mage evading magical authorities
23. a cursed knight seeking redemption
24. a magical creature hiding in a human city

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
