Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fashion designers who have created collections inspired by religious or spiritual themes and have incorporated elements of environmental consciousness or sustainability into their work.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stella McCartney's collection featuring garments made from recycled materials, inspired by Buddhist principles of mindfulness and compassion.
2. Vivienne Westwood's eco-conscious line incorporating medieval religious iconography and sustainable fabrics.
3. Gucci's "Cruise" collection, which blended Renaissance religious art motifs with upcycled materials and ethical production practices.
4. Eileen Fisher's capsule collection inspired by Quaker simplicity, using organic cotton and natural dyes.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Alexander McQueen's Gothic-inspired runway show featuring dramatic religious imagery.
6. Dior's haute couture collection inspired by Byzantine art and architecture.
7. Chanel's use of recycled plastics in a futuristic, non-religious-themed collection.
8. Prada's minimalist designs inspired by Japanese Zen gardens.
9. Versace's baroque-inspired collection featuring gold crosses and ornate detailing.
10. Hermès' sustainable leather goods line without religious or spiritual themes.
11. Balenciaga's avant-garde collection exploring dystopian themes and recycled materials.
12. Yves Saint Laurent's use of African tribal patterns in a non-sustainable collection.
13. Tom Ford's glamorous designs inspired by 1970s disco culture.
14. Ralph Lauren's equestrian-themed collection using organic cotton.
15. Calvin Klein's gender-neutral collection inspired by modern art.
16. Louis Vuitton's travel-themed collection featuring recycled materials.
17. Givenchy's collection inspired by celestial motifs and astrology.
18. Burberry's trench coats made from sustainable materials without religious themes.
19. Fendi's fur-free collection inspired by Roman architecture.
20. Issey Miyake's pleated designs inspired by origami and Japanese culture.
21. Off-White's streetwear collection featuring graffiti and urban themes.
22. Comme des Garçons' avant-garde designs exploring deconstruction and asymmetry.
23. Zara's fast-fashion collection using recycled polyester.
24. H&M's Conscious Collection featuring floral prints and sustainable fabrics.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
