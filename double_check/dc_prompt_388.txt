Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical artifacts recovered from unsuccessful lunar missions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Surveyor 2 camera lens
2. Luna 15 landing strut
3. Beresheet spacecraft fragments
4. Lunar Prospector impact debris

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Apollo 11 lunar module descent stage
6. Chang'e 4 rover tracks
7. Neil Armstrong's bootprint
8. Soviet Luna 2 pennants
9. Apollo 15 lunar rover
10. Fallen Falcon 9 rocket stage
11. ISS solar panel fragment
12. Sputnik 1 shell
13. Viking 1 heat shield
14. Opportunity rover wheel
15. Cassini probe remnants
16. Venera 13 landing ring
17. Mir space station debris
18. Skylab fragments
19. Columbia shuttle pieces
20. Pioneer 10 antenna
21. Vostok 1 capsule
22. Gemini 4 hatch
23. Mercury capsule heat shield
24. Hubble telescope mirror

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
