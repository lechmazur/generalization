Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures designed for precise measurement that utilize a coiled or retractable mechanism for storage or extension.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A tape measure with a retractable spring mechanism
2. A self-retracting steel measuring tape used in construction
3. A pocket-sized, coiled fabric tape measure for sewing
4. A long, retractable measuring wheel for distance measurement

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A ruler
6. A caliper
7. A micrometer
8. A protractor
9. A level
10. A plumb bob
11. A spring scale
12. A thermometer
13. A barometer
14. A stopwatch
15. A digital multimeter
16. A laser distance meter
17. A GPS device
18. A surveyor's transit
19. A theodolite
20. A sextant
21. A compass
22. A slide rule
23. A drafting compass
24. A T-square

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
