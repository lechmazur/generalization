Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures designed to mitigate the effects of infrequent, high-impact natural events.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Seawall
2. Flood levee
3. Earthquake-resistant building
4. Storm surge barrier

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Skyscraper
6. Bridge
7. Residential house
8. Highway overpass
9. Shopping mall
10. Airport terminal
11. Railway station
12. Office building
13. Sports stadium
14. Amusement park
15. Library
16. Hospital
17. University campus
18. Factory
19. Warehouse
20. Parking garage
21. Residential apartment complex
22. Convention center
23. Zoo
24. Art museum

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
