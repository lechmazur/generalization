Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Places or entities named after historical figures who significantly influenced their creation or development, but are not directly associated with the figure's birthplace or primary residence.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Carnegie Hall (New York City, named after Andrew Carnegie)
2. Rockefeller Center (New York City, named after John D. Rockefeller)
3. Hoover Dam (Nevada/Arizona border, named after Herbert Hoover)
4. Fermilab (Illinois, named after Enrico Fermi)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mount Vernon (George Washington's home)
6. Lincoln Memorial (memorial to Abraham Lincoln)
7. Washington, D.C. (named after George Washington)
8. Jefferson City (named after Thomas Jefferson)
9. Ford's Theatre (where Lincoln was assassinated)
10. Shakespeare's Globe (reconstruction of original theatre)
11. The Louvre (former royal palace)
12. The Eiffel Tower (designed by Gustave Eiffel)
13. The Statue of Liberty (gift from France)
14. The Colosseum (ancient Roman amphitheater)
15. The Great Pyramid of Giza (ancient Egyptian tomb)
16. The Taj Mahal (mausoleum)
17. The Empire State Building (named after New York's nickname)
18. The Chrysler Building (named after Walter Chrysler)
19. Times Square (named after the New York Times)
20. Hollywood Walk of Fame (honors celebrities)
21. Graceland (Elvis Presley's home)
22. Monticello (Thomas Jefferson's home)
23. Hyde Park (London park)
24. Central Park (New York City park)

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
