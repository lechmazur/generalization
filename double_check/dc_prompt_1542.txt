Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or techniques that involve intricate patterns being built up through repeated small-scale layering while maintaining structural flexibility

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. crochet lace
2. origami tessellations
3. basket weaving
4. knitting

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. brick wall
6. quilt
7. chain mail armor
8. mosaic art
9. macrame
10. embroidery
11. tile flooring
12. patchwork
13. beadwork
14. sandwich
15. layer cake
16. laminated wood
17. concrete slab
18. pavement
19. tapestry
20. collage
21. venetian blinds
22. stained glass window
23. chain link fence
24. tiled roof

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
