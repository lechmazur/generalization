Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate a flexible, textured surface for gripping, cleaning, or manipulating other materials, where the flexible surface is permanently bonded to a rigid core.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a silicone spatula with a rubberized handle
2. a textured steering wheel cover
3. a scrub brush with a flexible rubber base
4. a phone case with a soft, grippy exterior

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wooden spoon
6. a metal wrench
7. a glass jar
8. a ceramic mug
9. a plastic water bottle
10. a leather glove
11. a cotton towel
12. a stainless steel knife
13. a paper notebook
14. a vinyl record
15. a concrete block
16. a marble statue
17. a cardboard box
18. a wool sweater
19. a bamboo cutting board
20. a nylon rope
21. a copper wire
22. a porcelain vase
23. a polyester umbrella
24. a rubber band

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
