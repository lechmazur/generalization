Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Photographic works known for capturing reflections in unconventional settings

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A photograph of a city skyline reflected in a puddle on a street
2. An image of a forest mirrored in the surface of a pair of sunglasses
3. A picture capturing a sunset reflected in a glass building's windows
4. A photo of a mountain range reflected in a car's side mirror

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A portrait of a person
6. A landscape photograph of a desert
7. A black and white street photograph
8. A macro shot of a flower
9. A wildlife photograph of a lion
10. An aerial view of a city
11. A long exposure shot of a waterfall
12. A photograph of a busy market
13. A night sky photograph with stars
14. A close-up of a butterfly
15. A photograph of a historic building
16. A candid shot of a child playing
17. A photograph of a snowy landscape
18. A picture of a beach at sunrise
19. A photograph of a bustling city street
20. A still life photograph of fruit
21. A photograph of a concert
22. A photograph of a mountain peak
23. A photograph of a sports event
24. A photograph of a traditional festival

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
