Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures that utilize decentralized, self-sustaining networks to distribute resources or information without a central authority

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Bitcoin
2. Tor network
3. Mesh networks
4. Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Corporate hierarchical structure
6. Centralized database systems
7. Traditional banking systems
8. Government-controlled media
9. Client-server model
10. Public transportation systems
11. Supply chain management
12. Cloud computing services
13. Telecommunication networks
14. Traditional energy grids
15. Water distribution systems
16. National postal services
17. Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
18. Traditional education systems
19. Healthcare systems
20. Retail distribution networks
21. Public libraries
22. Traditional voting systems
23. Social media platforms
24. Corporate intranets

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
