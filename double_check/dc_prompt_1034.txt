Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Art forms or practices that involve a single performer using a traditional, handheld instrument to narrate or express cultural or historical stories through music or poetry.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a Japanese koto player performing a traditional epic ballad
2. a West African griot playing the kora while recounting ancestral tales
3. a Scottish bard reciting poetry accompanied by a cl√†rsach
4. a Rajasthani musician singing folk stories with a sarangi

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a symphony orchestra performing Beethoven's Fifth
6. a modern dance troupe interpreting a historical event
7. a painter creating a mural depicting cultural heritage
8. a film director producing a documentary about ancient civilizations
9. a theater group performing a Shakespearean play
10. a choir singing traditional hymns
11. a DJ mixing electronic music at a festival
12. a sculptor carving a statue of a historical figure
13. a novelist writing a book about a cultural legend
14. a photographer capturing images of traditional ceremonies
15. a street artist painting graffiti inspired by folklore
16. a puppeteer performing a traditional shadow play
17. a jazz band improvising on a classic tune
18. a ballet dancer performing a solo piece
19. a poet reciting modern free verse without music
20. a digital artist creating an animated short about history
21. a calligrapher writing ancient texts in a traditional style
22. a potter crafting traditional clay vessels
23. a fashion designer creating garments inspired by cultural motifs
24. a chef preparing a dish based on historical recipes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
