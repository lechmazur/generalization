Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific concepts or theories named after individuals who contributed significantly to multiple fields of study.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Maxwell's equations
2. Newton's laws of motion
3. Einstein's theory of relativity
4. Darwin's theory of evolution

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ohm's law
6. Boyle's law
7. Hooke's law
8. Pascal's principle
9. Fourier transform
10. Kepler's laws of planetary motion
11. Coulomb's law
12. Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction
13. Avogadro's law
14. Heisenberg uncertainty principle
15. Planck's constant
16. Bernoulli's principle
17. Archimedes' principle
18. Pythagorean theorem
19. Euclidean geometry
20. Galilean invariance
21. Mendel's laws of inheritance
22. Lavoisier's law of conservation of mass
23. Curie's law
24. Fermat's last theorem

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
