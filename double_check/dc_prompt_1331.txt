Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or structures that organize or categorize information or entities based on a hierarchical or sequential framework, where the arrangement is both non-arbitrary and verifiable through external rules or principles.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Dewey Decimal System
2. The geologic time scale
3. The Linnaean taxonomy
4. The periodic table of elements

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A family tree
6. A flowchart
7. A library catalog
8. A to-do list
9. A recipe
10. An alphabetical list of names
11. A color wheel
12. A musical scale
13. A map
14. A calendar
15. A database
16. A spreadsheet
17. A filing cabinet
18. A table of contents
19. An index
20. A dictionary
21. A thesaurus
22. An organizational chart
23. A food chain
24. A social hierarchy

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
