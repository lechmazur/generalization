Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological systems designed to simulate or replicate celestial navigation techniques used by ancient civilizations

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A software program that uses algorithms to mimic the star patterns used by Polynesian navigators for wayfinding.
2. A virtual reality system that recreates the night sky as seen by ancient Egyptian priests for astrological purposes.
3. An app that simulates the use of the astrolabe, a tool used by ancient Greek sailors for celestial navigation.
4. A digital platform that replicates the methods used by the Maya civilization to predict agricultural cycles based on celestial observations.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern GPS navigation system used in cars.
6. A smartphone app that provides real-time satellite imagery.
7. A computer program that calculates the position of planets for astronomical research.
8. A virtual planetarium that displays current night sky conditions.
9. A navigation system used by modern ships that relies on satellite data.
10. A software tool for designing and simulating satellite orbits.
11. An app that tracks the International Space Station's position in real-time.
12. A digital tool for mapping constellations visible from different parts of the world.
13. A program that simulates the movement of stars and planets for educational purposes.
14. A navigation app that uses augmented reality to guide users through urban environments.
15. A system that uses machine learning to predict weather patterns based on historical data.
16. A virtual reality experience that allows users to explore the solar system.
17. A software that calculates the best routes for drones based on wind and weather conditions.
18. An app that helps users identify stars and planets visible in the night sky.
19. A digital tool for tracking the phases of the moon for planning purposes.
20. A system that uses satellite data to monitor and predict natural disasters.
21. A program that simulates the effects of gravity on celestial bodies for physics education.
22. A navigation system for autonomous vehicles that uses lidar and radar technology.
23. A software that models the impact of solar flares on Earth's atmosphere.
24. An app that uses AI to predict the best times for stargazing based on local weather conditions.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
