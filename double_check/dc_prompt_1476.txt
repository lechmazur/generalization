Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific phenomena or systems that detect changes by comparing sequential measurements taken at regular intervals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a seismograph detecting earthquake tremors
2. a heart rate monitor tracking pulse changes over time
3. a weather station measuring temperature fluctuations
4. a motion sensor detecting movement in a room

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a thermometer measuring current temperature
6. a barometer measuring atmospheric pressure
7. a speedometer tracking vehicle speed
8. a pedometer counting steps
9. a GPS device tracking location
10. a light sensor detecting brightness
11. a smoke detector sensing smoke particles
12. a carbon monoxide detector measuring gas levels
13. a pH meter measuring acidity
14. a hygrometer measuring humidity
15. a wind vane indicating wind direction
16. a rain gauge measuring precipitation
17. a voltmeter measuring electrical voltage
18. a scale measuring weight
19. a stopwatch measuring elapsed time
20. a compass indicating magnetic north
21. a Geiger counter detecting radiation
22. a spectrometer analyzing light wavelengths
23. a sonar device detecting underwater objects
24. a radar system detecting distant objects

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
