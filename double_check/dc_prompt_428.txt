Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical phenomena first scientifically observed and documented between 1660 and 1700.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
2. Boyle's Law of Gas Pressure and Volume
3. Hooke's Law of Elasticity
4. Huygens' Principle of Wavefronts

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Einstein's Theory of Relativity
6. Maxwell's Equations of Electromagnetism
7. Ohm's Law of Electrical Resistance
8. Archimedes' Principle of Buoyancy
9. Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion
10. Bernoulli's Principle of Fluid Dynamics
11. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction
12. Pascal's Law of Fluid Pressure
13. Planck's Law of Black Body Radiation
14. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
15. Snell's Law of Refraction
16. Avogadro's Law of Gas Volumes
17. Fermat's Principle of Least Time
18. Galileo's Law of Falling Bodies
19. Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures
20. Newton's Laws of Motion
21. Bohr's Model of the Atom
22. Schrodinger's Wave Equation
23. Curie's Law of Magnetism
24. Fick's Laws of Diffusion

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
