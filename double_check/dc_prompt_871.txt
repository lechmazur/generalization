Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Events or phenomena that significantly altered global perceptions of conflict resolution through non-traditional or unexpected means

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The fall of the Berlin Wall through peaceful protests
2. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission
3. The Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland
4. The Salt March led by Mahatma Gandhi

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Treaty of Versailles
6. The Cuban Missile Crisis resolution
7. The League of Nations formation
8. The Camp David Accords
9. The United Nations peacekeeping missions
10. The Marshall Plan implementation
11. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
12. The Geneva Conventions
13. The Paris Peace Accords
14. The Treaty of Rome
15. The Nuremberg Trials
16. The Helsinki Accords
17. The Dayton Agreement
18. The Oslo Accords
19. The Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe
20. The Chemical Weapons Convention
21. The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
22. The International Criminal Court establishment
23. The Treaty of Portsmouth
24. The Congress of Vienna

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
