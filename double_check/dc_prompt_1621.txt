Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring biological structures that create geometric patterns through self-organizing luminescence

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Firefly synchronization patterns
2. Bioluminescent plankton aggregations
3. Mycena lux-coeli mushroom glow patterns
4. Deep-sea anglerfish lure patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Snowflake formation
6. Hexagonal basalt columns
7. Spider web designs
8. Leaf venation patterns
9. Fractal branching in trees
10. Honeycomb structures
11. Peacock feather patterns
12. Coral reef formations
13. Sand dune ripples
14. Animal migration patterns
15. Galaxy spiral arms
16. Crystal lattice structures
17. Weather patterns
18. Human fingerprint patterns
19. Termite mound architecture
20. Seed dispersal patterns
21. Cloud formations
22. River meandering patterns
23. Animal flocking behaviors
24. Mountain range formations

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
