Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological systems named after historical explorers that manage or process information

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Magellan Data Navigator
2. Columbus Information Tracker
3. Vespucci Analytics Platform
4. Hudson Resource Manager

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a GPS navigation system
6. a weather forecasting tool
7. a social media algorithm
8. a search engine
9. a blockchain ledger
10. a cloud storage service
11. a machine learning model
12. a virtual assistant
13. a data encryption software
14. a customer relationship management system
15. a video streaming platform
16. a cybersecurity firewall
17. a digital payment gateway
18. a project management tool
19. a language translation app
20. a recommendation engine
21. a stock trading algorithm
22. a virtual reality headset
23. a smart home automation system
24. a quantum computing processor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
