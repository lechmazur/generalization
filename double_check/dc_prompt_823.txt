Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Literary works that prominently feature a character who is a writer and explores themes of existential isolation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. "The Bell Jar" by Sylvia Plath
2. "The Stranger" by Albert Camus
3. "Notes from Underground" by Fyodor Dostoevsky
4. "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" by Milan Kundera

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee
6. "1984" by George Orwell
7. "Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen
8. "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald
9. "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger
10. "Moby-Dick" by Herman Melville
11. "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley
12. "The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde
13. "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Bronte
14. "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien
15. "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Bronte
16. "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" by Mark Twain
17. "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley
18. "The Scarlet Letter" by Nathaniel Hawthorne
19. "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky
20. "The Grapes of Wrath" by John Steinbeck
21. "One Hundred Years of Solitude" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez
22. "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller
23. "Slaughterhouse-Five" by Kurt Vonnegut
24. "The Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
