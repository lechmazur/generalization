Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Experimental musicians who have created their own custom digital instruments or interfaces specifically to perform their compositions live

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Imogen Heap using her Mi.Mu gloves
2. Reeps One developing and using his bespoke vocal percussion software and hardware
3. Jordan Rudess playing the custom-designed GeoShred app on an iPad
4. Suzanne Ciani performing with her Buchla 200e modular synthesizer system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Kraftwerk using sequencers in the 1970s
6. Brian Eno creating generative music with software
7. Aphex Twin using custom Max/MSP patches
8. Autechre performing with custom-programmed Elektron devices
9. Deadmau5 using his "mau5head" helmet
10. Daft Punk's stage show with elaborate lighting and visuals
11. Bj√∂rk's use of the Reactable instrument
12. Herbie Hancock playing the keytar
13. Jean-Michel Jarre's laser harp
14. Morton Subotnick composing electronic music with the Buchla synthesizer
15. Wendy Carlos using the Moog synthesizer for film scores
16. Laurie Spiegel creating algorithmic music
17. Holly Herndon using AI in her music creation
18. Grimes using Ableton Live in her performances
19. Flying Lotus using visuals and 3D mapping in his shows
20. Squarepusher playing bass guitar with complex effects
21. Radiohead using the ondes Martenot
22. Nine Inch Nails using custom stage props and instruments
23. Matmos using unconventional objects as instruments
24. Steve Reich using phasing techniques in his compositions

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
