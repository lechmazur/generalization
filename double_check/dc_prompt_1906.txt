Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Philosophical movements named after their founders that emerged in the 19th or 20th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Marxism
2. Freudianism
3. Darwinism
4. Skinnerian behaviorism

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Existentialism
6. Stoicism
7. Empiricism
8. Rationalism
9. Phenomenology
10. Pragmatism
11. Positivism
12. Structuralism
13. Epicureanism
14. Platonism
15. Nihilism
16. Materialism
17. Idealism
18. Realism
19. Modernism
20. Postmodernism
21. Determinism
22. Utilitarianism
23. Absolutism
24. Relativism

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
