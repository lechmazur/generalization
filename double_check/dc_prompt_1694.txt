Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Venues or locations that temporarily transform their primary function to host horse-related events exactly three times per year

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A convention center that hosts equestrian competitions in March, July, and November
2. A stadium that transforms into a venue for horse shows in April, August, and December
3. An arena that hosts horse jumping events in May, September, and January
4. A fairground that converts to a horse racing track for events in June, October, and February

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A park that hosts a horse parade annually
6. A theater that occasionally hosts horse-themed performances
7. A museum that has a permanent exhibit on horse history
8. A farm that offers horse riding lessons daily
9. A racetrack that hosts horse races every weekend
10. A hotel that has a horse stable for guests
11. A shopping mall that hosts a horse-themed festival once a year
12. A school that has a horse riding club that meets weekly
13. A community center that hosts a horse show every other month
14. A restaurant that serves horse-themed dishes
15. A library that has a section dedicated to books about horses
16. A gymnasium that hosts a horse-themed charity event biannually
17. A beach that hosts horse races during the summer months
18. A campground that offers horse trail rides on weekends
19. A city square that hosts a horse-drawn carriage event quarterly
20. A country club that has a horse riding facility for members
21. A zoo that has a horse exhibit open year-round
22. A festival ground that hosts a horse-themed carnival annually
23. A sports complex that hosts horse polo matches monthly
24. A historic site that offers horse-drawn tours daily

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
