Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or practices that integrate mathematical principles into cultural or artistic expressions to convey deeper meanings or enhance understanding.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Islamic geometric patterns in mosque architecture
2. The golden ratio in Renaissance paintings
3. Fractal patterns in African tribal designs
4. Sacred geometry in mandala art

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A calculator
6. Mathematical equations written on a blackboard
7. An abacus
8. A protractor
9. Sheet music notation
10. A sundial
11. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics
12. A multiplication table
13. Binary code
14. A compass rose
15. An architectural blueprint
16. A pie chart
17. A musical metronome
18. A calendar
19. A chess board
20. A multiplication flash card
21. A ruler
22. A graph paper notebook
23. A scientific calculator display
24. A mathematical formula poster

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
