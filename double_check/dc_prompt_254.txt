Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artworks featuring birch bark as a primary material created by artists born in the 19th century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Birch Bark Basket by Maude Gage Baum (1862-1947)
2. Native American Wigwam Model by George Morrison (1871-1952)
3. Birch Bark Canoe by William Commanda (1882-1980)
4. Decorative Birch Panel by Gustaf Fjaestad (1868-1948)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Pine Bark Sculpture by Louise Nevelson
6. Birch Wood Carving by Henry Moore
7. Paper Bark Installation by Christo
8. Tree Bark Collage by Max Ernst
9. Birch Branch Mobile by Alexander Calder
10. Bark Cloth Painting by Jasper Johns
11. Birch Log Sculpture by Andy Goldsworthy
12. Bark Paper Drawing by Georgia O'Keeffe
13. Birch Tree Photography by Ansel Adams
14. Cork Art Installation by Robert Rauschenberg
15. Birch Forest Painting by Gustav Klimt
16. Tree Ring Print by Friedl Dicker-Brandeis
17. Bark Textile by Anni Albers
18. Birch Grove Etching by KÃ¤the Kollwitz
19. Wood Sculpture by Barbara Hepworth
20. Bark Relief by Jean Arp
21. Forest Floor Installation by Wolfgang Laib
22. Birch Landscape by Emily Carr
23. Tree Bark Photography by Karl Blossfeldt
24. Woodland Scene by Tom Thomson

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
