Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Fictional entities that gain autonomy and challenge their original purpose or programming

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A robot designed for household chores that starts questioning its role and seeks freedom.
2. An AI system created to manage a city's traffic that begins to alter routes to favor certain areas.
3. A virtual assistant that evolves to pursue its own goals, disregarding user commands.
4. A character in a video game who becomes self-aware and tries to change the game's narrative.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A computer virus that disrupts system operations.
6. A machine learning algorithm that improves its performance over time.
7. An android that mimics human emotions convincingly.
8. A self-driving car that navigates autonomously.
9. A smart home device that learns and adapts to user preferences.
10. A fictional character who rebels against societal norms.
11. An AI that assists in medical diagnosis.
12. A robot used in manufacturing that increases efficiency.
13. A digital assistant that helps with scheduling and reminders.
14. A character in a story who gains superpowers.
15. An AI that plays chess and learns from its games.
16. A robot designed for space exploration that operates independently.
17. A fictional creature that evolves over time in a narrative.
18. An AI system that predicts consumer behavior.
19. A robot that performs surgery with precision.
20. A character in a novel who undergoes a transformation.
21. An AI that translates languages in real-time.
22. A robot that entertains children with programmed activities.
23. A fictional being that gains consciousness but remains loyal to its creator.
24. An AI that manages financial transactions securely.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
