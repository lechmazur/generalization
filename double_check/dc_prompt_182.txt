Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural elements from the Renaissance period that depict mythological scenes on ceilings

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The ceiling fresco of the Camera degli Sposi in Mantua, depicting the Gonzaga family and Olympian gods.
2. The central panel of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, illustrating scenes from the Book of Genesis, including the creation of Adam and Eve.
3. The stucco and fresco decoration of the Villa Farnesina Loggia, portraying the myth of Cupid and Psyche.
4. The ceiling painting in the Palazzo Te's Sala dei Giganti, showing the fall of the giants, a mythological battle scene.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A Roman bust of Julius Caesar
6. A Gothic cathedral's stained-glass window depicting biblical scenes
7. A Renaissance portrait of a nobleman
8. A fresco of the Last Supper in a monastery refectory
9. A Baroque sculpture of David and Goliath
10. An Egyptian sarcophagus with hieroglyphic inscriptions
11. A Greek temple frieze depicting the Battle of the Centaurs
12. A Roman mosaic floor depicting scenes of daily life
13. A medieval tapestry depicting the unicorn hunt
14. An illuminated manuscript page with floral decorations
15. A Renaissance altarpiece depicting the Madonna and Child
16. A Baroque ceiling fresco depicting allegorical figures
17. A Rococo painting of a pastoral scene
18. A Neoclassical sculpture of Venus de Milo
19. An Impressionist painting of water lilies
20. A Cubist painting of a still life
21. A Surrealist painting of a melting clock
22. An Abstract Expressionist painting with bold colors
23. A Pop Art sculpture of a Campbell's soup can
24. A Minimalist sculpture of a steel cube

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
