Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or tools that incorporate circular symmetry and radial precision for functional or symbolic purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. sundial
2. protractor
3. compass rose
4. astrolabe

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. steering wheel
6. vinyl record
7. clock face
8. pizza
9. dartboard
10. bicycle wheel
11. circular saw blade
12. manhole cover
13. dinner plate
14. frisbee
15. CD-ROM
16. pie chart
17. color wheel
18. roulette wheel
19. pinwheel
20. wagon wheel
21. circular window
22. round table
23. ship's helm
24. lazy susan

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
