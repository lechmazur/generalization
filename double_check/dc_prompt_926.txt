Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural artifacts that incorporate both natural elements and human craftsmanship to symbolize a connection between the spiritual and physical worlds.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a totem pole carved with animal spirits and natural motifs
2. a dreamcatcher woven with feathers and beads
3. a Tibetan prayer wheel inscribed with mantras and adorned with gemstones
4. a Maori greenstone pendant shaped like a fish hook, symbolizing prosperity and connection to the sea

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a ceramic vase
6. a wooden chair
7. a bronze statue
8. a glass sculpture
9. a woven basket
10. a leather-bound book
11. a metal shield
12. a stone tablet
13. a clay pot
14. a silk scarf
15. a wooden mask
16. a marble statue
17. a beaded necklace
18. a painted canvas
19. a carved walking stick
20. a woven rug
21. a ceramic figurine
22. a metal amulet
23. a wooden flute
24. a stone sculpture

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
