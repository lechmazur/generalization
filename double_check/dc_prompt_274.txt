Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or situations that are left unattended and undergo a transformation due to natural processes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A rusty bicycle left in a field
2. A wooden boat decaying on a shore
3. A pile of leaves decomposing in a forest
4. An abandoned building overtaken by vines

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A car being restored in a garage
6. A garden being tended by a homeowner
7. A painting being restored in a museum
8. A piece of fruit ripening on a tree
9. A child playing with a toy in a park
10. A machine being maintained by a technician
11. A freshly painted fence
12. A new sculpture in a public space
13. A person actively cleaning a room
14. A newly planted tree in a yard
15. A book being read by a student
16. A freshly baked loaf of bread
17. A car driving on a highway
18. A person exercising in a gym
19. A newly constructed building
20. A freshly cut bouquet of flowers
21. A chef cooking a meal in a kitchen
22. A child building a sandcastle on a beach
23. A musician playing an instrument
24. A person writing in a journal

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
