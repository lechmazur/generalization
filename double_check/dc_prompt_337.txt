Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Representations of individuals created for funerary purposes where the individual represented held significant power during their life.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a terracotta warrior from the mausoleum of the first Qin emperor
2. a statue of a pharaoh from an ancient Egyptian tomb
3. a bust of a Roman emperor displayed in a mausoleum
4. a funerary mask of a Mayan ruler

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a portrait of a medieval king painted during his reign
6. a statue of a Greek god in a temple
7. a modern-day wax figure of a celebrity
8. a commemorative coin featuring a historical leader
9. a mural depicting a battle scene with a victorious general
10. a tapestry showing a royal coronation ceremony
11. a bronze statue of a philosopher in a public square
12. a painting of a queen commissioned for her palace
13. a sculpture of a mythological hero in a museum
14. a mosaic of a Roman senator in a villa
15. a photograph of a modern political leader in an office
16. a relief carving of a deity on a temple wall
17. a stained-glass window depicting a saint in a church
18. a figurine of a warrior from a historical reenactment
19. a drawing of a tribal chief in a history book
20. a statue of a founding father in a city park
21. a bust of a poet displayed in a library
22. a painting of a noble family in their estate
23. a sculpture of a mythological creature in a garden
24. a commemorative plaque honoring a war hero

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
