Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures built primarily of sun-dried mud bricks that incorporate astronomical alignments related to solar events.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Chaco Canyon's Pueblo Bonito
2. Great Zimbabwe
3. Casa Rinconada
4. Nabta Playa

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge
6. Giza Pyramids
7. Machu Picchu
8. Angkor Wat
9. Newgrange
10. Hagia Sophia
11. Petra
12. Colosseum
13. Notre-Dame Cathedral
14. Parthenon
15. Moai Statues of Easter Island
16. Leaning Tower of Pisa
17. Alhambra
18. Great Wall of China
19. Taj Mahal
20. Mount Rushmore
21. Christ the Redeemer
22. Burj Khalifa
23. Sydney Opera House
24. Empire State Building

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
