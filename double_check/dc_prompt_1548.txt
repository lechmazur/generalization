Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that are deliberately arranged in a descending size order to achieve a practical function

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Nesting dolls
2. Stackable food storage containers
3. A set of graduated measuring cups
4. Telescoping ladders

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A collection of antique coins arranged by year
6. Books on a shelf sorted alphabetically by author
7. A rainbow
8. A flight of stairs
9. A pyramid
10. Concentric circles
11. A set of differently sized screws
12. A decreasing sequence of numbers
13. Russian dolls arranged chronologically
14. A set of weights for a scale
15. A stack of pancakes
16. Layers of sedimentary rock
17. A sorted deck of cards
18. A group of people arranged by height
19. A set of mixing bowls
20. A collection of progressively smaller boxes, each containing a gift
21. A tower built with blocks
22. A set of sieves with progressively finer mesh
23. A collection of drill bits
24. A set of cookie cutters

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
