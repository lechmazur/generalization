Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific discoveries made by analyzing frozen material that had been naturally preserved for over 1000 years

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Analysis of ancient ice cores revealing atmospheric composition from 1,000 years ago
2. Discovery of ancient viruses preserved in permafrost for over a millennium
3. Identification of prehistoric plant species from seeds frozen in glaciers for 1,000+ years
4. Reconstruction of ancient climate patterns using frozen lake sediments over 1,000 years old

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Fossilized dinosaur bones
6. Preserved amber with insects inside
7. Ancient pottery shards found in archaeological digs
8. Mummified remains from Egyptian tombs
9. Petrified wood
10. Stone tools from the Paleolithic era
11. Ancient coins discovered in shipwrecks
12. Preserved scrolls from the Dead Sea
13. Frozen mammoth remains from the last Ice Age
14. Ancient cave paintings
15. Preserved textiles from Viking burial sites
16. Fossilized footprints of early humans
17. Ancient Roman aqueducts
18. Preserved seeds from medieval storage pits
19. Fossilized coral reefs
20. Ancient manuscripts from monastic libraries
21. Preserved leather artifacts from bogs
22. Fossilized fish from ancient lake beds
23. Ancient jewelry found in burial mounds
24. Preserved wooden ships from Viking times

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
