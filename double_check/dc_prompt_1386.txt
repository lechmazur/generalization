Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Abandoned research facilities in remote desert locations that were used for classified government experiments before 1970

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Camp Century in Greenland
2. Dugway Proving Ground in Utah
3. White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico
4. Nevada Test Site Area 12

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Los Alamos National Laboratory
6. Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant
7. Hanford Site
8. Rocky Flats Plant
9. Fort Detrick
10. Aberdeen Proving Ground
11. Plum Island Animal Disease Center
12. Wright-Patterson AFB
13. Camp Hero
14. Fort Irwin Research Center
15. Brookhaven National Laboratory
16. Oak Ridge National Laboratory
17. Sandia National Laboratories
18. Lawrence Livermore Laboratory
19. Edwards Air Force Base
20. China Lake Naval Weapons Center
21. Fort Huachuca
22. Tonopah Test Range
23. Wendover Air Force Base
24. Groom Lake Facility

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
