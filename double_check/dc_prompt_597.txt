Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Entities whose primary defining characteristic involves a quantifiable change in physical scale or form triggered by a specific, identifiable external stimulus.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A bimetallic strip bending when heated
2. A liquid crystal changing color with temperature variation
3. A photovoltaic cell producing electricity when exposed to light
4. A shape memory alloy resuming its original form when heated

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A chameleon changing color
6. A plant growing towards sunlight
7. A child growing taller
8. Ice melting into water
9. Water boiling into steam
10. A rubber band stretching
11. A balloon inflating
12. A metal expanding with heat
13. A flower blooming
14. Hair growing longer
15. A caterpillar transforming into a butterfly
16. A tadpole becoming a frog
17. Wood burning in a fire
18. A rock eroding
19. A tire deflating
20. Dough rising
21. Fruit ripening
22. A battery discharging
23. A spring compressing
24. A muscle contracting

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
