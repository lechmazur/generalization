Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Portable devices designed for observing celestial phenomena with adjustable time-lapse functionality.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Astronomical observation camera with time-lapse mode
2. Portable telescope with integrated time-lapse feature
3. Handheld star tracker with time-lapse recording
4. Compact sky-watching device with adjustable time-lapse

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphone with a camera
6. Binoculars for bird watching
7. Digital camera with zoom lens
8. Portable weather station
9. Handheld GPS device
10. Smartwatch with fitness tracking
11. Night vision goggles
12. Drone with video recording
13. Portable solar charger
14. Action camera for sports
15. Wireless Bluetooth speaker
16. Portable power bank
17. Handheld gaming console
18. Digital voice recorder
19. Portable air purifier
20. Smart home assistant device
21. Portable camping stove
22. Handheld metal detector
23. Portable water filter
24. Compact travel umbrella

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
