Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural formations or phenomena that are named after their auditory characteristics, where the sound produced is a defining feature of their identity or perception.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Whispering Gallery
2. Booming Dunes
3. Singing Sand
4. Moaning Cavern

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Niagara Falls
6. Grand Canyon
7. Mount Everest
8. Victoria Falls
9. Northern Lights
10. Rainbow
11. Earthquake
12. Volcano
13. Tsunami
14. Hurricane
15. Tornado
16. Blizzard
17. Geyser
18. Glacier
19. Stalactite
20. Stalagmite
21. Echolocation
22. Dog whistle
23. Sonar
24. Thunder

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
