Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Photographic portraits of costumed infants interacting with miniature replicas of ancient Greek furniture or architectural elements.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A baby dressed as a Roman gladiator sitting on a tiny replica of a Greek klismos chair.
2. An infant in a medieval knight costume playing with a miniature model of a Greek Ionic column.
3. A newborn wearing a pirate outfit lying next to a small-scale replica of a Greek kline bed.
4. A toddler in a fairy costume standing beside a miniature version of a Greek Corinthian capital.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A child in a superhero costume playing with a toy car.
6. An adult dressed as a historical figure posing with a full-sized antique chair.
7. A baby in a dinosaur costume interacting with a modern toy sofa.
8. A photograph of a Greek temple without any people or costumes.
9. An infant in a plain onesie sitting on a regular baby chair.
10. A toddler dressed as a princess playing with a dollhouse.
11. An adult in a Greek god costume standing next to a life-sized replica of a Roman column.
12. A baby in a cowboy outfit playing with a toy horse.
13. A child in a wizard costume reading a book on a regular couch.
14. A photograph of a modern architectural model without any people or costumes.
15. An infant in a sports jersey playing with a toy basketball hoop.
16. A toddler in a firefighter costume interacting with a toy fire truck.
17. An adult in a historical costume posing with a full-sized antique table.
18. A baby in a chef outfit playing with toy kitchen utensils.
19. A child in a space suit costume playing with a toy rocket.
20. A photograph of a Greek statue without any people or costumes.
21. An infant in a ballerina costume dancing on a regular stage.
22. A toddler in a police officer costume playing with a toy police car.
23. An adult in a Greek goddess costume standing next to a life-sized replica of a Greek temple.
24. A baby in a construction worker outfit playing with toy building blocks.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
