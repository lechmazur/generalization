Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Classical compositions inspired by or named after natural hallucinogenic substances

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fanfare for the Common Man
2. Music for the Royal Fireworks
3. The Four Seasons
4. William Tell Overture

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Requiem in D minor, K. 626
6. Brandenburg Concertos
7. The Planets
8. The Rite of Spring
9. Clair de Lune
10. Boléro
11. Symphony No. 5 in C minor
12. Swan Lake
13. The Nutcracker
14. Peer Gynt Suite No. 1
15. Pictures at an Exhibition
16. Canon in D major
17. Eine kleine Nachtmusik
18. Water Music
19. Messiah
20. Toccata and Fugue in D minor
21. Für Elise
22. Moonlight Sonata
23. The Barber of Seville
24. Carmen

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
