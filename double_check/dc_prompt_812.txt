Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that revolutionized inventory management in the 20th and 21st centuries

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Barcode scanners
2. Radio-frequency identification (RFID)
3. Warehouse management systems (WMS)
4. Cloud-based inventory management software

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Forklifts
6. Conveyor belts
7. Pallets
8. Shipping containers
9. Just-in-time manufacturing
10. Supply chain management software
11. Customer relationship management (CRM) software
12. E-commerce platforms
13. The internet
14. Personal computers
15. Mobile devices
16. Database software
17. Statistical process control
18. Lean manufacturing
19. Six Sigma
20. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs)
21. Robotics
22. 3D printing
23. Artificial intelligence
24. Blockchain technology

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
