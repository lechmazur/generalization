Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional musical instruments that are played with sticks or mallets and have a cylindrical shape

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Djembe
2. Timpani
3. Marimba
4. Conga

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Guitar
6. Piano
7. Violin
8. Flute
9. Trumpet
10. Drum set
11. Bass
12. Harp
13. Accordion
14. Saxophone
15. Clarinet
16. Oboe
17. Cello
18. Ukulele
19. Mandolin
20. Banjo
21. Sitar
22. Bagpipes
23. Harmonica
24. Didgeridoo

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
