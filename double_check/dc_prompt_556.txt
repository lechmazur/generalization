Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures designed for a specific purpose that have been repurposed by nature as a habitat for a keystone species.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Abandoned railway bridges in the Pacific Northwest hosting peregrine falcon nests
2. Old water towers in Texas serving as primary roosting sites for Mexican free-tailed bats
3. Decommissioned oil platforms off California's coast supporting sea lion colonies
4. Historic grain silos in Chicago harboring critical populations of chimney swifts

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bird nests in traffic lights
6. Squirrels living in attics
7. Bees colonizing wall cavities
8. Moss growing on building walls
9. Abandoned mine shafts
10. Empty barns housing owls
11. Coral reefs near coastal structures
12. Pigeons nesting under bridges
13. Vines covering old buildings
14. Fish swimming in flooded quarries
15. Rabbits burrowing under concrete slabs
16. Termites in wooden structures
17. Abandoned subway tunnels with rat colonies
18. Weeds growing through sidewalk cracks
19. Spiders in window frames
20. Raccoons in chimneys
21. Algae on sea walls
22. Foxes denning in drainage pipes
23. Wasps nesting in shed eaves
24. Lichens on old monuments

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
