Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Religious or mythological deities whose physical forms incorporate both human and elephant characteristics

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ganesha
2. Erawan
3. Airavata
4. Vinayaka

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Zeus
6. Anubis
7. Minotaur
8. Centaur
9. Hanuman
10. Sphinx
11. Garuda
12. Sekhmet
13. Thoth
14. Bastet
15. Horus
16. Pan
17. Medusa
18. Vishnu
19. Krishna
20. Lakshmi
21. Kali
22. Quetzalcoatl
23. Sobek
24. Hathor

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
