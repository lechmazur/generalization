Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made from plant fibers used historically for binding or tying.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. hemp rope
2. jute twine
3. flax cord
4. raffia string

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. cotton thread
6. nylon rope
7. silk ribbon
8. metal chain
9. plastic zip tie
10. rubber band
11. leather strap
12. wool yarn
13. velcro strip
14. steel cable
15. polyester string
16. glass fiber cord
17. aluminum wire
18. carbon fiber thread
19. copper wire
20. kevlar rope
21. elastic cord
22. paracord
23. fishing line
24. rubber hose

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
