Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architectural structures or objects that incorporate spiral or helical forms to optimize space, airflow, or aesthetic appeal while maintaining structural integrity.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Guggenheim Museum in New York City
2. The DNA double helix model
3. The Nautilus shell
4. The helical staircase in the Vatican Museum

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A geodesic dome
6. A suspension bridge
7. A skyscraper with a rectangular design
8. A traditional pagoda
9. A Gothic cathedral
10. A cantilever bridge
11. A tensile structure
12. A Roman aqueduct
13. A pyramid
14. A traditional Japanese tea house
15. A geodesic sphere
16. A modern glass office building
17. A traditional log cabin
18. A steel arch bridge
19. A concrete dam
20. A thatched roof cottage
21. A medieval castle
22. A modern art museum with straight lines
23. A traditional adobe house
24. A steel-frame high-rise building

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
