Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or tools that revolutionized their respective fields by providing a fundamentally new way to understand, diagnose, or regulate complex systems.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in molecular biology.
2. The development of the Global Positioning System (GPS) in navigation.
3. The implementation of the Internet Protocol (IP) in computer networking.
4. The creation of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in psychiatry.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the wheel in transportation.
6. The discovery of penicillin in medicine.
7. The use of the assembly line in manufacturing.
8. The development of the steam engine in the Industrial Revolution.
9. The creation of the printing press in communication.
10. The establishment of the scientific method in research.
11. The introduction of double-entry bookkeeping in accounting.
12. The invention of the microscope in biology.
13. The development of the theory of relativity in physics.
14. The creation of the periodic table in chemistry.
15. The use of the compass in navigation.
16. The invention of the telephone in communication.
17. The development of the airplane in transportation.
18. The introduction of the electric light bulb in daily life.
19. The creation of the World Wide Web in information sharing.
20. The use of the stethoscope in medicine.
21. The invention of the telescope in astronomy.
22. The development of the internal combustion engine in automotive industry.
23. The introduction of the bar code in retail.
24. The creation of the transistor in electronics.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
