Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects made of silver that produce a clear, ringing sound when struck and were manufactured before 1900.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A coin silver teaspoon made in London in 1850
2. A sterling silver handbell crafted in Boston in 1888
3. A Mexican silver peso minted in 1875
4. A small silver Tibetan singing bowl from 1822

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A steel tuning fork
6. A crystal wine glass
7. A brass bell
8. A silver plated spoon made in 1902
9. A gold coin from 1880
10. A modern silver pendant
11. An aluminum wind chime
12. A porcelain teacup
13. A silver candlestick made in 1910
14. A bronze cymbal
15. A glass bottle
16. A wooden xylophone key
17. A silver bracelet made in 1925
18. A platinum ring
19. A stainless steel bowl
20. A silver tea set made in 1901
21. An antique pewter tankard
22. A copper gong
23. A silver locket made in 1950
24. A cast iron bell

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
