Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural practices or technologies that use rhythmic patterns to encode or transmit information, where the rhythm itself serves as a primary medium of communication or organization.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. African talking drums
2. Morse code telegraph signals
3. Aboriginal Australian message sticks
4. Ancient Greek water clocks with rhythmic droplet patterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. metronomes
6. church bells
7. musical notation
8. traffic light timing systems
9. sundials
10. digital pulse counters
11. heart rate monitors
12. drum circles
13. military marching cadences
14. factory assembly lines
15. mechanical pendulums
16. tribal dance ceremonies
17. prayer beads
18. ship chronometers
19. binary code
20. meditation breathing patterns
21. rowing team synchronization
22. ceremonial drumming
23. signal flags
24. semaphore systems

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
