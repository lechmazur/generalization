Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Naturally occurring periodic pauses or gaps that occur between regular cycles in biological systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The interval between heartbeats in a resting human
2. The period of dormancy between growth cycles in deciduous trees
3. The time between successive molts in the life cycle of an insect
4. The pause between breaths in a sleeping mammal

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The time between high tides
6. The interval between planetary alignments
7. The period between economic recessions
8. The gap between Olympic Games
9. The time between software updates
10. The interval between train arrivals at a station
11. The period between major historical events
12. The gap between seasons of a television series
13. The time between eruptions of a geyser
14. The interval between flights at an airport
15. The period between full moons
16. The gap between annual company meetings
17. The time between solar eclipses
18. The interval between bus schedules
19. The period between national elections
20. The gap between academic semesters
21. The time between major sports tournaments
22. The interval between book releases by an author
23. The period between music album releases by a band
24. The gap between technology product launches

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
