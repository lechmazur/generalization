Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or documentary works that capture a specific moment of daily transition between darkness and light

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A photograph capturing the first light of dawn breaking over a city skyline.
2. A painting depicting the moment streetlights turn on as dusk settles over a quiet neighborhood.
3. A short film showing the transition from night to day as a market begins to open.
4. A poem describing the shift from twilight to nightfall in a rural landscape.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A documentary about the history of street lighting.
6. A painting of a sunset over the ocean.
7. A novel set in a city that never sleeps.
8. A photograph of a starry night sky.
9. A film about the nightlife in a bustling metropolis.
10. A poem about the beauty of a full moon.
11. A short story set entirely at midnight.
12. A documentary on the effects of light pollution.
13. A painting of a bright sunny day in a park.
14. A photograph of a cityscape at noon.
15. A film capturing the hustle and bustle of a morning commute.
16. A poem about the midday sun.
17. A novel that takes place over a single night.
18. A documentary about the evolution of timekeeping.
19. A painting of a moonlit beach.
20. A photograph of a sunrise over a mountain range.
21. A short film about the nightlife in a small town.
22. A poem about the afternoon rain.
23. A novel that explores the concept of time travel.
24. A documentary on the history of photography.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
