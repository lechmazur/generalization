Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural practices or artifacts that deliberately incorporate incompleteness or unfinished elements as a core philosophical principle

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Japanese kintsugi pottery, where broken pieces are repaired with gold, emphasizing imperfections
2. unfinished novels or manuscripts left intentionally incomplete by authors
3. deliberately asymmetrical or incomplete designs in wabi-sabi aesthetics
4. musical compositions with open-ended or unresolved endings

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a perfectly symmetrical sculpture
6. a fully completed jigsaw puzzle
7. a polished marble statue
8. a meticulously edited film
9. a flawless diamond
10. a finished painting with no visible brushstrokes
11. a fully constructed skyscraper
12. a complete symphony with a definitive ending
13. a perfectly tailored suit
14. a fully baked cake with no cracks or imperfections
15. a finalized architectural blueprint
16. a fully edited and published novel
17. a seamless ceramic vase
18. a completed crossword puzzle
19. a perfectly restored antique
20. a fully assembled piece of furniture
21. a flawless digital rendering
22. a finished quilt with no loose threads
23. a complete set of matching dinnerware
24. a fully developed video game with no bugs

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
