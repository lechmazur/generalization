Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): National parks in the United States that contain canyons named after royalty

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kings Canyon National Park
2. Prince Canyon in Yellowstone National Park
3. Royal Arch Canyon in Grand Canyon National Park
4. Empress Canyon in Death Valley National Park

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Bryce Canyon National Park
6. Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park
7. Grand Canyon National Park
8. Zion Canyon National Park
9. Antelope Canyon
10. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area
11. Canyon de Chelly National Monument
12. Kings Peak in Kings Canyon
13. Royal Gorge Bridge and Park
14. Crown Point at Bryce Canyon
15. Queen's Garden Trail
16. Emperor Falls in Glacier National Park
17. Monarch Cave in Bears Ears
18. Castle Canyon in Carlsbad Caverns
19. Imperial Point at Grand Canyon
20. Coronado National Memorial
21. Prince William Forest Park
22. Queen Victoria Rock in Yosemite
23. Duchess Cave in Mammoth Cave
24. Royal Arch in Arches National Park

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
