Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or concepts that were initially misunderstood or misinterpreted by contemporary societies but later revealed to have complex, intentional designs or purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Antikythera Mechanism, initially dismissed as a complex clock, later revealed to be an astronomical calculator predicting celestial movements.
2. Nazca Lines, once thought to be simple irrigation ditches or pathways, now understood as elaborate geoglyphs with potential ritualistic significance.
3. Stonehenge, originally interpreted as a Druid temple or Roman construction, now recognized as a prehistoric monument aligned with solar and lunar events.
4. Voynich Manuscript, initially considered a hoax or coded message, now believed to be a potentially genuine document with an unknown language and purpose, possibly related to herbal remedies or alchemy.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Crop circles
6. The Shroud of Turin
7. The pyramids of Giza
8. The Easter Island Moai
9. GÃ¶bekli Tepe
10. The Great Sphinx of Giza
11. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
12. Machu Picchu
13. The Terracotta Army
14. Angkor Wat
15. The Mayan calendar
16. The Rosetta Stone
17. The Library of Alexandria
18. The Colossus of Rhodes
19. The Lighthouse of Alexandria
20. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
21. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
22. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia
23. Qin Shi Huang's tomb
24. The Phaistos Disc

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
