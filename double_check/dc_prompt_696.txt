Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artworks that incorporate celestial bodies as a central motif and are created by artists known for their unconventional use of materials.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A sculpture of a supernova crafted from recycled computer components by an artist known for their "technosculptures."
2. An installation featuring a projected lunar eclipse onto a hanging tapestry woven from human hair by an artist famous for using bodily materials in their work.
3. A mixed-media piece depicting the Milky Way galaxy using rusting metal shavings and discarded plastic bags by an artist who primarily works with found objects.
4. A series of photographs of planetary nebulae printed on silk scarves dyed with natural pigments derived from plants by an artist known for their unconventional photographic printing techniques.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A painting of a sunset.
6. A photograph of the night sky.
7. A traditional oil painting of the constellations.
8. A bronze sculpture of a Greek god associated with a planet.
9. A digital illustration of a spaceship.
10. A song about the moon.
11. A poem about the stars.
12. A science fiction novel about space travel.
13. A documentary about astronomy.
14. A telescope.
15. An astrolabe.
16. A meteorite.
17. A piece of moon rock.
18. A model of the solar system.
19. A stained-glass window depicting a biblical scene with stars.
20. A children's book about the planets.
21. A mobile featuring planets.
22. A ceramic bowl with a galaxy glaze.
23. A watercolor painting of a comet.
24. A wooden carving of the sun.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
