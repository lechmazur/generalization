Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for a single human user that incorporate a dedicated space or mechanism for containing or supporting the user's head

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a reclining chair with a built-in headrest
2. a virtual reality headset with adjustable straps
3. a motorcycle helmet with a padded interior
4. a massage chair with a neck support cushion

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a bicycle
6. a desk lamp
7. a pair of headphones
8. a backpack
9. a car seat
10. a pillow
11. a hammock
12. a laptop stand
13. a pair of sunglasses
14. a wristwatch
15. a treadmill
16. a yoga mat
17. a water bottle
18. a pair of gloves
19. a sleeping bag
20. a pair of shoes
21. a keyboard
22. a coffee mug
23. a bookshelf
24. a pair of scissors

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
