Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or tools that combine a soft, pliable material with a rigid, structural component to enhance functionality or aesthetic contrast.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a toothbrush with a soft rubber grip and a hard plastic handle
2. a laptop bag with a padded, soft interior and a hard, protective shell exterior
3. a shoe with a soft leather upper and a rigid sole for support
4. a pen with a soft silicone grip and a hard plastic body

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a pillow
6. a hammer
7. a sponge
8. a metal chair
9. a wooden table
10. a glass vase
11. a cotton shirt
12. a leather belt
13. a plastic bottle
14. a rubber ball
15. a steel rod
16. a ceramic mug
17. a silk scarf
18. a wool sweater
19. a nylon rope
20. a paper clip
21. a concrete block
22. a denim jacket
23. a rubber tire
24. a metal fork

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
