Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): cultural practices or rituals that involve the symbolic use of circular formations to represent unity, continuity, or cyclical processes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a Native American medicine wheel used in healing ceremonies
2. a Sufi whirling dervish dance symbolizing spiritual unity
3. a Celtic stone circle used in solstice celebrations
4. a Hindu rangoli design created during Diwali to symbolize the cycle of life

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wedding ring
6. a Ferris wheel
7. a clock face
8. a circular table
9. a roundabout in a city
10. a basketball hoop
11. a car tire
12. a vinyl record
13. a hula hoop
14. a circular saw blade
15. a pizza
16. a globe
17. a bicycle wheel
18. a coin
19. a circular mirror
20. a round shield
21. a circular rug
22. a donut
23. a circular window
24. a circular pool

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
