Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects intentionally modified to prevent or mitigate a specific, documented historical disaster or near-disaster.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. O-rings redesigned after the Challenger disaster
2. Watertight bulkheads added to ships after the Titanic sinking
3. Reinforced cockpit doors implemented after 9/11
4. TAWS terrain warning systems installed after multiple CFIT accidents

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Life jackets on airplanes
6. Fire extinguishers
7. Lightning rods
8. Earthquake-resistant buildings
9. Safety goggles
10. Smoke detectors
11. Seat belts
12. Emergency exits
13. Flood barriers
14. Radiation shields
15. Storm shelters
16. Circuit breakers
17. Safety valves
18. Guardrails
19. Airbags
20. Bulletproof vests
21. Emergency oxygen masks
22. Hazmat suits
23. Tsunami warning buoys
24. Fallout shelters

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
