Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Mechanical devices that utilize a continuously variable transmission for their primary function.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Honda Civic Hybrid
2. Nissan Murano
3. Subaru Outback
4. Yamaha Tmax

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a mountain bike
6. a manual transmission car
7. a skateboard
8. a rowing machine
9. a wind-up clock
10. a traditional bicycle
11. a steam engine
12. a diesel locomotive
13. a jet ski
14. a hoverboard
15. a roller coaster
16. a Segway
17. a treadmill
18. a gas-powered lawn mower
19. a chainsaw
20. a snowmobile
21. a go-kart
22. a scooter
23. a dirt bike
24. a fishing reel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
