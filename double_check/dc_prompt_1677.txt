Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that were historically used to record information but required specialized knowledge or tools to decode their contents

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Quipu
2. Cipher disk
3. Punched card
4. Wax tablet

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A diary
6. A letter
7. A newspaper
8. A book
9. A photograph
10. A painting
11. A sculpture
12. A film reel
13. A cassette tape
14. A vinyl record
15. A floppy disk
16. A CD
17. A USB drive
18. A hard drive
19. Cave paintings
20. Hieroglyphics
21. Runes
22. Morse code
23. Semaphore flags
24. Smoke signals

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
