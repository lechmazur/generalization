Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Spaces or environments that facilitate the interpretation of cultural or social meanings through their ambient characteristics and subtle cues.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A dimly lit room with soft jazz music playing in the background, where people gather to discuss art and literature.
2. A bustling street market filled with vendors selling traditional foods and crafts, where the sounds and smells evoke a sense of cultural heritage.
3. A serene garden with carefully placed sculptures and water features, designed to inspire contemplation and reflection on nature and spirituality.
4. A modern art gallery with minimalist decor and strategic lighting, where the ambiance enhances the viewer's engagement with the displayed works.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A brightly lit classroom with educational posters on the walls.
6. A noisy factory floor with machinery and workers in safety gear.
7. A quiet library with rows of books and study tables.
8. A crowded subway car during rush hour.
9. A sports stadium filled with cheering fans and bright lights.
10. A cozy living room with a fireplace and family photos.
11. A sterile hospital room with medical equipment and monitors.
12. A bustling airport terminal with travelers and announcements.
13. A serene beach with clear water and white sand.
14. A dark alley with graffiti and trash cans.
15. A high-tech laboratory with scientists in white coats.
16. A traditional church with stained glass windows and pews.
17. A vibrant nightclub with flashing lights and loud music.
18. A peaceful countryside with rolling hills and farmhouses.
19. A busy shopping mall with stores and food courts.
20. A minimalist office with sleek furniture and large windows.
21. A historic castle with stone walls and ancient artifacts.
22. A lively playground with children playing and laughing.
23. A tranquil spa with soothing music and scented candles.
24. A cluttered garage with tools and old furniture.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
