Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that were first discovered or invented in the 1960s and have a rotational or circular component as a key feature.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the Lava Lamp
2. the Hula Hoop
3. the Frisbee
4. the Wham-O Super Ball

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a vinyl record
6. a bicycle wheel
7. a roulette wheel
8. a ceiling fan
9. a windmill
10. a carousel
11. a gyroscope
12. a spinning top
13. a Ferris wheel
14. a propeller
15. a yo-yo
16. a record player
17. a merry-go-round
18. a washing machine drum
19. a centrifuge
20. a pottery wheel
21. a helicopter rotor
22. a clock face
23. a pinwheel
24. a drill bit

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
