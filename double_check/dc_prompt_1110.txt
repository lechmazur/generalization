Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that utilize magnetic properties to guide, organize, or influence directional or informational flow.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A magnetic compass
2. A magnetic hard drive
3. A magnetic levitation train (maglev)
4. A cathode ray tube (CRT)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A map
6. A GPS device
7. A road sign
8. A traffic light
9. A barcode scanner
10. A QR code
11. A radio antenna
12. A fiber optic cable
13. A copper wire
14. A water pipe
15. A train track
16. An airplane
17. A ship
18. A book
19. A computer keyboard
20. A computer mouse
21. A touch screen
22. A light bulb
23. A battery
24. A solar panel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
