Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Ceremonial vessels designed to hold warm, fatty liquids that are traditionally passed between multiple users during religious or social rituals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a Tibetan butter tea churn
2. a communal kava bowl
3. a ceremonial gourd cup for mate
4. a shared chalice for mulled wine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a teapot
6. a coffee mug
7. a wine glass
8. a soup bowl
9. a thermos
10. a gravy boat
11. a sake cup
12. a beer stein
13. a water pitcher
14. a shot glass
15. a cocktail shaker
16. a milk jug
17. a gravy ladle
18. a soup tureen
19. a tea infuser
20. a champagne flute
21. a decanter
22. a coffee carafe
23. a punch bowl
24. a gravy dish

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
