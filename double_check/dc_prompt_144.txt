Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Sounds made by humans that require specialized physical movements of the tongue against specific parts of the mouth and cannot be easily replicated by non-native speakers

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the rolled "r" sound in Spanish
2. the retroflex "t" sound in Hindi
3. the uvular trill in French
4. the lateral fricative "ll" sound in Welsh

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a whistle
6. a sneeze
7. a cough
8. a hum
9. a yawn
10. a laugh
11. a scream
12. a whisper
13. a sigh
14. a hiccup
15. a snore
16. a growl
17. a grunt
18. a moan
19. a shriek
20. a gasp
21. a murmur
22. a chant
23. a song
24. a cry

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
