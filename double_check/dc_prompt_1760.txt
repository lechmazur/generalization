Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Religious structures that incorporate specific natural elements in their architecture or rituals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Megalithic tombs incorporating large stones believed to possess spiritual significance.
2. Shinto shrines utilizing sacred groves and incorporating natural wood and thatch in their construction.
3. Native American medicine wheels constructed with stones aligned to celestial events and cardinal directions.
4. Christian churches with stained-glass windows depicting natural scenes and incorporating water in baptismal rituals.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A church built of brick.
6. A mosque with geometric patterns.
7. A synagogue decorated with symbolic art.
8. A temple with gold leaf ornamentation.
9. A Buddhist stupa.
10. A Hindu temple with intricate carvings.
11. A cathedral with flying buttresses.
12. A monastery located on a mountaintop.
13. A hermitage in a forest.
14. An altar made of marble.
15. A crucifix made of wood.
16. A menorah made of metal.
17. A prayer rug made of wool.
18. Incense used in religious ceremonies.
19. Candles used in religious rituals.
20. Holy water used in blessings.
21. Religious texts written on parchment.
22. Hymns sung in worship services.
23. Prayers recited in religious gatherings.
24. Buildings designed with feng shui principles.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
