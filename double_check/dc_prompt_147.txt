Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Astronomical phenomena that have been successfully simulated in laboratory conditions using analog materials or systems

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Accretion disks around black holes using rotating fluids
2. Solar flares using plasma experiments
3. Planetary rings using granular materials
4. Neutron star mergers using colliding droplets of superfluid helium

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Observing a lunar eclipse
6. Calculating the trajectory of a comet
7. Building a scale model of the solar system
8. Photographing the Milky Way
9. Measuring the redshift of a distant galaxy
10. Detecting gravitational waves
11. Studying the composition of meteorites
12. Simulating the formation of stars in a computer
13. Analyzing data from a space telescope
14. Launching a weather satellite
15. Creating a 3D model of a nebula
16. Developing a new type of telescope
17. Teaching astronomy in a classroom
18. Writing a science fiction novel about space travel
19. Visiting a planetarium
20. Watching a documentary about the universe
21. Using a telescope to observe Jupiter
22. Tracking the movement of asteroids
23. Searching for extraterrestrial life
24. Studying the cosmic microwave background radiation

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
