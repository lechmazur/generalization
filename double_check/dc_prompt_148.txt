Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or systems designed to support weight that rely primarily on tension rather than compression forces

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Golden Gate Bridge cables
2. Rock climbing harness
3. Circus trapeze rigging
4. Spider web

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Roman arch
6. Steel I-beam
7. Stone column
8. Concrete dam
9. Brick wall
10. Flying buttress
11. Metal scaffold
12. Wooden post
13. Support bracket
14. Foundation slab
15. Load-bearing wall
16. Steel truss
17. Granite pillar
18. Retaining wall
19. Concrete pier
20. Metal strut
21. Stone abutment
22. Support beam
23. Concrete pillar
24. Steel frame

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
