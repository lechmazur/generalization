Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or tools traditionally used in ceremonial or artistic practices that are crafted from natural materials and imbued with symbolic meaning.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A carved wooden mask used in traditional dances
2. A feather quill pen used in ancient rituals
3. A stone sculpture representing a deity in religious ceremonies
4. A woven grass basket used in harvest festivals

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern paintbrush made from synthetic materials
6. A plastic trophy awarded at a sports event
7. A metal ceremonial sword used in knighthood ceremonies
8. A digital artwork displayed on a screen
9. A glass vase used as a centerpiece at a wedding
10. A leather-bound book used for personal journaling
11. A silk scarf worn as part of a cultural costume
12. A cotton flag used in national celebrations
13. A rubber stamp used for office paperwork
14. A ceramic mug used in daily life
15. A nylon rope used in climbing activities
16. A polyester banner displayed at a concert
17. A steel hammer used in construction work
18. A titanium ring worn as jewelry
19. A concrete statue in a public park
20. A woolen blanket used for warmth
21. A linen tablecloth used at a dinner party
22. A bamboo flute played in a modern orchestra
23. A copper pot used in cooking
24. A synthetic fiber carpet in a home

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
