Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects traditionally made of iron that were historically used to communicate over long distances

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. church bell
2. railroad signal bell
3. ship's bell
4. town bell tower

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. telephone
6. telegraph key
7. radio antenna
8. brass horn
9. wooden drum
10. smoke signal pot
11. signal mirror
12. flag pole
13. lighthouse lamp
14. messenger pigeon cage
15. signal cannon
16. heliograph
17. semaphore flags
18. bronze gong
19. warning siren
20. signal flare
21. beacon fire pit
22. drum tower
23. speaking trumpet
24. signal lantern

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
