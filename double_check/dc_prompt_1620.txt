Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Devices or systems that analyze large quantities of discrete units to predict future patterns but were invented before 1950

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Hollerith tabulating machine
2. Powers-Samas punched card machines
3. IBM 601 multiplying punch
4. BTM Type 3 statistical machine

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Google Analytics
6. SPSS software
7. Watson supercomputer
8. Crystal ball
9. Weather vane
10. Abacus
11. Slide rule
12. ENIAC
13. Stock ticker
14. Mechanical calculator
15. Astrolabe
16. Geiger counter
17. Barometer
18. Random number generator
19. Census ledger
20. Mechanical adding machine
21. Difference engine
22. Analytical engine
23. Pascal's calculator
24. Modern predictive analytics software

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
