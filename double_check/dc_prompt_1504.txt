Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that use colored lights in a repeating sequence to indicate status or progress

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A device on a coffee maker that cycles through red, yellow, and green lights to show brewing progress
2. An air purifier with a sequence of blue, purple, and white lights indicating different stages of air cleaning
3. A charging dock for electronic devices that uses a pattern of flashing orange and steady green lights to show charging status
4. A water filtration system that displays a rotating sequence of blue, green, and red lights to indicate filter life and water quality

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A traffic light that changes from red to green
6. A Christmas tree with static multicolored lights
7. A smartphone screen displaying a solid blue light when charging
8. A flashlight with a single white light
9. A car dashboard with a steady red light indicating low fuel
10. A neon sign with a static yellow glow
11. A computer monitor with a blinking cursor
12. A street lamp that turns on at dusk
13. A laser pointer with a continuous red beam
14. A light bulb that dims and brightens in a single color
15. A disco ball with rotating multicolored lights
16. A fire alarm with a flashing red light during an alert
17. A glow stick that emits a steady green light
18. A movie theater sign with a static marquee
19. A candle flame flickering in one color
20. A digital clock with a changing display but no colored lights
21. A strobe light used in a nightclub
22. A lamp with a touch-sensitive color-changing base
23. A security camera with a steady infrared light
24. A toy car with headlights that turn on and off

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
