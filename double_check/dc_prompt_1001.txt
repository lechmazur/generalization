Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): artifacts or phenomena that are associated with a specific, legendary location or event and have been recreated or referenced in modern technology or media

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Excalibur sword in video games
2. Atlantis in animated films
3. Troy in historical dramas
4. El Dorado in adventure movies

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a smartphone
6. a digital camera
7. a smartwatch
8. a laptop
9. a microwave oven
10. a refrigerator
11. a washing machine
12. a vacuum cleaner
13. a blender
14. a toaster
15. a hair dryer
16. a television
17. a radio
18. a printer
19. a coffee maker
20. a dishwasher
21. a sewing machine
22. a lawn mower
23. a electric drill
24. a air conditioner

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
