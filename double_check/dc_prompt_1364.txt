Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Methods of establishing truth or authenticity that rely on comparing two physically separated pieces that must perfectly match

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Verifying the authenticity of a torn banknote by matching the serial numbers and patterns on both halves
2. Confirming the identity of a broken ancient artifact by fitting the two pieces together perfectly
3. Authenticating a historical document by comparing the watermarks on two separate pieces of paper
4. Proving the originality of a piece of art by matching the signature on two separate canvases

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Using DNA testing to confirm paternity
6. Verifying a person's identity through fingerprint analysis
7. Authenticating a wine bottle by checking its label and cork
8. Confirming the validity of a passport through its hologram and microprinting
9. Using carbon dating to determine the age of an artifact
10. Verifying a credit card by checking its chip and signature
11. Authenticating a painting by analyzing its brush strokes and pigments
12. Confirming the identity of a person through facial recognition technology
13. Verifying the authenticity of a coin by examining its weight and metal composition
14. Using a polygraph test to determine the truthfulness of a statement
15. Authenticating a stamp by checking its perforations and ink
16. Confirming the originality of a manuscript by analyzing its handwriting and ink
17. Verifying the authenticity of a watch by examining its serial number and movement
18. Using voice recognition to confirm a person's identity
19. Authenticating a piece of jewelry by checking its hallmarks and gemstones
20. Confirming the validity of a driver's license through its hologram and barcode
21. Verifying the authenticity of a photograph by analyzing its metadata and EXIF data
22. Using blockchain technology to confirm the ownership of a digital asset
23. Authenticating a musical instrument by examining its craftsmanship and materials
24. Confirming the identity of a person through iris scanning technology

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
