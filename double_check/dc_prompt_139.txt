Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Handheld optical devices used historically by seafaring professions to aid in navigation or observation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. sextant
2. spyglass
3. octant
4. astrolabe

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. compass
6. map
7. telescope
8. binoculars
9. chronometer
10. barometer
11. anemometer
12. logbook
13. star chart
14. gyroscope
15. radar
16. sonar
17. periscope
18. lantern
19. signal flag
20. life preserver
21. anchor
22. ship's wheel
23. sextant case
24. nautical almanac

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
