Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects that have been struck by documented hail larger than 4 inches in diameter.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. 1965 Ford Mustang in Fort Worth, Texas
2. greenhouse at Johnson Family Farm in Aurora, Nebraska
3. metal storage shed in Moore, Oklahoma
4. Walmart shopping cart in Vivian, South Dakota

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. dented mailbox in Kansas City
6. cracked windshield in Denver
7. broken solar panel in Phoenix
8. damaged roof in Dallas
9. bent street sign in Chicago
10. shattered window in Houston
11. crushed trash can in Miami
12. broken garden gnome in Seattle
13. dented car hood in Minneapolis
14. damaged satellite dish in Atlanta
15. broken flower pot in Portland
16. cracked bird bath in Boston
17. damaged lawn furniture in Detroit
18. broken outdoor light in Sacramento
19. dented garbage bin in Austin
20. damaged pool cover in Tampa
21. broken weather vane in Nashville
22. cracked skylight in San Diego
23. damaged air conditioner unit in Memphis
24. broken patio umbrella in Cleveland

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
