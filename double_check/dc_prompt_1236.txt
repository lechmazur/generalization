Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Historical or mythological events involving natural phenomena that are symbolically or literally interpreted as divine intervention or supernatural occurrences.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, which some Romans interpreted as a punishment from the gods.
2. The parting of the Red Sea in the biblical Exodus story, seen as a divine intervention to aid the Israelites.
3. The Great Flood in various mythologies, such as the story of Noah's Ark, interpreted as a divine cleansing of the earth.
4. The appearance of Halley's Comet in 1066, which was seen as an omen of victory for William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg.
6. The signing of the Magna Carta in 1215.
7. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914.
8. The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming.
9. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
10. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912.
11. The moon landing in 1969.
12. The signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
13. The invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell.
14. The discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492.
15. The Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries.
16. The assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC.
17. The construction of the Great Wall of China.
18. The French Revolution in 1789.
19. The invention of the wheel in ancient times.
20. The signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.
21. The discovery of electricity by Benjamin Franklin.
22. The fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD.
23. The invention of the internet in the late 20th century.
24. The Renaissance period in Europe.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
