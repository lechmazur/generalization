Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Political figures who were the first woman or person of color to run for major party presidential nomination in the United States

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Shirley Chisholm
2. Hillary Clinton
3. Barack Obama
4. Kamala Harris

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Abraham Lincoln
6. Margaret Thatcher
7. John F. Kennedy
8. Rosa Parks
9. George Washington
10. Eleanor Roosevelt
11. Martin Luther King Jr.
12. Franklin D. Roosevelt
13. Susan B. Anthony
14. Thomas Jefferson
15. Sojourner Truth
16. Theodore Roosevelt
17. Harriet Tubman
18. Winston Churchill
19. Malcolm X
20. Benjamin Franklin
21. Indira Gandhi
22. Frederick Douglass
23. Lyndon B. Johnson
24. Booker T. Washington

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
