Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for precise distribution of liquids or gases through engineered apertures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Spray nozzle
2. Fuel injector
3. Nebulizer
4. Airbrush

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Water bottle
6. Garden hose
7. Faucet
8. Fire hydrant
9. Drinking straw
10. IV drip
11. Syringe
12. Pipette
13. Watering can
14. Teapot
15. Perfume bottle
16. Gas pump
17. Scuba tank
18. Balloon
19. Air compressor
20. Oxygen mask
21. Exhaust pipe
22. Chimney
23. Hair dryer
24. Fan

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
