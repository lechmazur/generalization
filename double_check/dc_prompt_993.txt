Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or events that serve as cultural or technological beacons, guiding or influencing communities in unique ways

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The invention of the printing press
2. The Eiffel Tower
3. The first moon landing
4. The Great Firewall of China

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A popular social media platform
6. The invention of the wheel
7. The discovery of penicillin
8. The construction of the pyramids
9. A viral dance craze
10. A bestselling novel
11. The development of the internet
12. A specific model of a popular car
13. A fashion trend
14. A hit song
15. The invention of the telescope
16. A widely used programming language
17. A specific type of architecture
18. A philosophical movement
19. A scientific theory
20. A religious text
21. A political ideology
22. A historical event
23. A work of art
24. A sporting event

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
