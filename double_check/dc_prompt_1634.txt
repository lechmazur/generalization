Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Scientific artifacts or discoveries that were initially misidentified as religious or mythological objects when first found

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Antikythera Mechanism
2. Fossilized Dinosaur Bones
3. Ancient Astronomical Alignments
4. Viking Sunstone

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge
6. The Rosetta Stone
7. The Dead Sea Scrolls
8. The Shroud of Turin
9. The Nazca Lines
10. The Oracle of Delphi
11. The Terracotta Army
12. The Moai Statues of Easter Island
13. The Pyramids of Giza
14. The Sphinx
15. The Voynich Manuscript
16. The Baghdad Battery
17. The Ark of the Covenant
18. The Holy Grail
19. The Philosopher's Stone
20. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
21. The Library of Alexandria
22. The Colossus of Rhodes
23. The Lighthouse of Alexandria
24. The Labyrinth of Crete

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
