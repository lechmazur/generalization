Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects traditionally used in coming-of-age ceremonies that are worn or carried by the initiate and kept as keepsakes afterward

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A beaded bracelet given during a Quincea√±era
2. A yarmulke worn at a Bar Mitzvah
3. A feather worn in a Native American vision quest
4. A cross necklace received at a Confirmation

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A graduation cap
6. A wedding ring
7. A trophy from a sports competition
8. A diploma
9. A birthday cake
10. A driver's license
11. A first job paycheck
12. A college acceptance letter
13. A prom dress
14. A baby's first shoe
15. A family heirloom necklace
16. A military uniform
17. A passport
18. A first car
19. A high school yearbook
20. A retirement watch
21. A christening gown
22. A first apartment key
23. A engagement ring
24. A first published book

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
