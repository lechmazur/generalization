Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that fundamentally altered human interaction with the cosmos

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the telescope
2. the Hubble Space Telescope
3. the James Webb Space Telescope
4. the Large Hadron Collider

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the printing press
6. the steam engine
7. the internet
8. the smartphone
9. the radio
10. the telegraph
11. the airplane
12. the satellite
13. the GPS system
14. the microscope
15. the X-ray machine
16. the MRI scanner
17. the electric light bulb
18. the computer
19. the laser
20. the atomic bomb
21. the solar panel
22. the wind turbine
23. the electric car
24. the drone

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
