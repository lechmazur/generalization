Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Human-made objects designed for long-term mobile habitation that utilize animal power for locomotion.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Vardo traditionally used by Romani people in Europe.
2. A Conestoga wagon used by settlers in North America.
3. A Yurt mounted on a wheeled frame and pulled by oxen across the steppes.
4. A small, covered wagon designed for two people, pulled by a single horse, used for nomadic trading.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A houseboat
6. A recreational vehicle (RV)
7. A tent
8. A log cabin
9. A train car
10. A cruise ship
11. A bicycle
12. A horse-drawn carriage
13. A sedan chair
14. A palanquin
15. A rickshaw
16. A pack animal with saddlebags
17. A covered wagon pulled by a tractor
18. A mobile home
19. A yurt
20. A teepee
21. A house on wheels (not pulled by animals)
22. A ship
23. An airplane
24. A submarine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
