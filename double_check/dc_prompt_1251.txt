Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): technological or cultural innovations that emerged from isolated or remote communities and later gained global significance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Didgeridoo, a traditional wind instrument developed by Indigenous Australians, which has gained worldwide recognition and use in various music genres.
2. The Inuit kayak, originally designed for hunting and transportation in the Arctic, which has influenced modern recreational and competitive kayaking globally.
3. The Polynesian outrigger canoe, a design that has significantly influenced modern sailing and boat-building techniques around the world.
4. The Maori Haka, a traditional war dance from New Zealand, which has been adopted and recognized globally in sports and cultural performances.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The internet, a global network that revolutionized communication and information sharing.
6. The printing press, an innovation that transformed the spread of knowledge and literacy.
7. The smartphone, a device that has become integral to modern communication and daily life.
8. The steam engine, a key development in the Industrial Revolution that powered machinery and transportation.
9. The wheel, an ancient invention that has been fundamental to transportation and machinery.
10. The compass, an essential tool for navigation that has influenced global exploration and trade.
11. The guitar, a musical instrument that has evolved and spread across various cultures and genres.
12. The bicycle, a mode of transportation that has influenced urban planning and personal mobility.
13. The telescope, an instrument that has advanced our understanding of the universe.
14. The airplane, a revolutionary mode of transportation that has connected the world.
15. The radio, a device that transformed communication and entertainment.
16. The television, a medium that has shaped global culture and information dissemination.
17. The computer, a machine that has revolutionized data processing and communication.
18. The camera, a device that has changed the way we capture and share visual information.
19. The electric light bulb, an invention that has transformed daily life and work.
20. The refrigerator, a household appliance that has impacted food preservation and safety.
21. The sewing machine, a tool that has influenced the textile industry and personal crafting.
22. The phonograph, a device that revolutionized the recording and playback of sound.
23. The satellite, a technology that has enabled global communication and navigation.
24. The microscope, an instrument that has advanced scientific research and medical diagnostics.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
