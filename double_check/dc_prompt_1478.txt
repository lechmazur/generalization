Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Digital systems that translate continuous analog signals into discrete numerical values while deliberately preserving some of the original signal's natural variations or imperfections

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Audio processing software that applies dithering to maintain the warmth of analog recordings during digital conversion
2. A digital camera that uses film grain emulation to preserve the aesthetic of traditional photography
3. A vinyl record digitization tool that intentionally retains some surface noise to mimic the original listening experience
4. A medical imaging system that keeps minor fluctuations in signal intensity to reflect biological variability

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A digital thermometer that converts temperature readings into numerical values
6. A smartphone app that converts voice recordings into text
7. A digital audio workstation that removes all background noise from recordings
8. A scanner that converts printed text into editable digital text
9. A digital oscilloscope that displays electrical signals in real-time
10. A software that converts analog video to digital format without any intentional imperfections
11. A digital signal processor that filters out all unwanted frequencies from an audio signal
12. A barcode scanner that reads and converts barcodes into digital data
13. A digital converter that transforms analog TV signals into digital signals for modern televisions
14. A pressure sensor that converts physical pressure into digital readings
15. A digital audio interface that converts analog audio signals into digital audio files
16. A software that converts handwritten notes into digital text
17. A digital multimeter that measures and displays electrical values
18. A system that converts analog sensor data into digital data for analysis
19. A digital converter that transforms analog radio signals into digital signals
20. A software that converts analog drawings into digital vector graphics
21. A digital converter that changes analog voltage signals into digital values
22. A system that converts analog seismic data into digital data for geological analysis
23. A digital converter that transforms analog light signals into digital data for fiber optic communication
24. A software that converts analog weather data into digital data for meteorological analysis

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
