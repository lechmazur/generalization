Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Techniques or methods that combine precise mathematical modeling with deliberately imperfect or incomplete data to make predictions about human behavior or social phenomena

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Using Bayesian inference to predict election outcomes based on incomplete polling data
2. Applying machine learning algorithms to forecast consumer spending patterns with noisy transactional data
3. Modeling disease spread in a population using stochastic processes and limited case reports
4. Predicting traffic flow dynamics using differential equations and sparse sensor data

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Analyzing historical stock prices to predict future trends
6. Using linear regression to estimate the relationship between education and income
7. Forecasting weather patterns using satellite imagery and atmospheric models
8. Predicting sports outcomes based on player statistics and team performance
9. Estimating population growth using census data and demographic models
10. Using neural networks to classify images of handwritten digits
11. Predicting crop yields based on soil quality and weather conditions
12. Modeling the spread of wildfires using geographic and meteorological data
13. Forecasting energy demand using historical consumption patterns
14. Predicting customer churn using CRM data and machine learning
15. Estimating the impact of advertising campaigns on sales revenue
16. Using sentiment analysis to predict public opinion on social media
17. Modeling the spread of misinformation using network analysis
18. Predicting the success of new product launches using market research
19. Forecasting airline passenger numbers using booking data
20. Estimating the likelihood of loan defaults using credit scores
21. Predicting crime rates using demographic and socioeconomic data
22. Modeling the spread of infectious diseases using contact tracing data
23. Forecasting retail sales using point-of-sale data and seasonal trends
24. Predicting student performance using standardized test scores

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
