Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Tools or weapons depicted in Renaissance paintings of Christian martyrs.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. In one painting, Saint Sebastian is depicted tied to a column and pierced with arrows.
2. A painting shows Saint Catherine of Alexandria with a broken wheel at her feet.
3. Saint Lawrence is portrayed in a painting lying on a gridiron, symbolizing his martyrdom.
4. In a depiction of Saint Peter's martyrdom, he is shown being crucified upside down on a cross.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A medieval tapestry showing knights with swords.
6. A sculpture of a Greek god holding a thunderbolt.
7. A painting of a hunter with a bow and arrow in a forest scene.
8. An illustration of a blacksmith forging a sword.
9. A photograph of a modern soldier with a rifle.
10. A drawing of a Viking warrior wielding an axe.
11. A film still showing a character using a dagger in a fight scene.
12. An ancient Egyptian relief depicting a pharaoh with a ceremonial staff.
13. A comic book panel featuring a superhero with a laser gun.
14. A historical reenactment photo of a Civil War soldier with a musket.
15. A video game screenshot showing a character using a sword to fight a monster.
16. An advertisement for a kitchen knife set.
17. A museum exhibit of a samurai's katana.
18. A painting of a Native American with a tomahawk.
19. A sculpture of a Roman gladiator with a trident.
20. A photograph of a construction worker using a hammer.
21. An illustration of a pirate with a cutlass.
22. A drawing of a medieval peasant using a scythe in a field.
23. A film poster showing a character with a futuristic weapon.
24. A painting of a mythological figure holding a spear.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
