Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural or spiritual landmarks that are also natural geographical formations and hold significant meaning in local traditions or religions.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Uluru/Ayers Rock in Australia
2. Mount Kailash in Tibet
3. Bear Butte in South Dakota
4. Mount Fuji in Japan

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stonehenge
6. The Great Pyramid of Giza
7. Notre Dame Cathedral
8. The Grand Canyon
9. Mount Everest
10. Machu Picchu
11. The Vatican
12. Angel Falls
13. The Western Wall
14. Mount Rushmore
15. The Blue Mosque
16. Niagara Falls
17. Easter Island Statues
18. The Parthenon
19. Mount Sinai
20. The Golden Temple
21. Victoria Falls
22. The Taj Mahal
23. Giant's Causeway
24. Angkor Wat

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
