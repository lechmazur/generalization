Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical structures or systems that were originally designed for military defense but have since been repurposed for civilian recreational use.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Fort Adams State Park in Newport, Rhode Island
2. The High Line in New York City
3. Suomenlinna fortress islands in Helsinki
4. Fort Monroe National Monument in Virginia

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ellis Island Immigration Museum
6. The Pentagon
7. Alcatraz Island
8. USS Constitution Museum
9. Churchill War Rooms
10. Pearl Harbor National Memorial
11. The Alamo
12. Bunker Hill Monument
13. Fort McHenry
14. West Point Military Academy
15. Imperial War Museum
16. Checkpoint Charlie Museum
17. National World War II Museum
18. Fort Ticonderoga
19. USS Midway Museum
20. Normandy American Cemetery
21. Arlington National Cemetery
22. National Naval Aviation Museum
23. Canadian War Museum
24. Fort Knox

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
