Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Digital payment systems that deliberately exaggerate transaction processing times to appear more secure to users

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A mobile banking app displays a spinning loading icon for 10 seconds after a successful transaction, even though the transaction is processed instantly.
2. A peer-to-peer payment platform shows a progress bar slowly filling up during a transfer, despite the funds being transferred immediately.
3. An online retailer's checkout process includes a simulated "security check" animation that adds a 5-second delay before confirming the purchase.
4. A cryptocurrency exchange displays a "blockchain verification" message with a timer that artificially extends the transaction confirmation time.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Two-factor authentication requiring a code from a separate device.
6. Biometric login using fingerprint or facial recognition.
7. End-to-end encryption for messaging apps.
8. Using a virtual private network (VPN) for online browsing.
9. Regularly updating software to patch security vulnerabilities.
10. A website using HTTPS protocol.
11. Complex password requirements with minimum length and special characters.
12. Security questions for account recovery.
13. Email notifications for login attempts from new devices.
14. Antivirus software scanning for malware.
15. A firewall blocking unauthorized network access.
16. Hardware security tokens for added protection.
17. Using a password manager to store credentials securely.
18. Avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.
19. A bank requiring in-person identity verification for new accounts.
20. Credit card companies using fraud detection algorithms.
21. A website displaying security certifications and badges.
22. Using a dedicated device for online banking.
23. Regularly backing up important data.
24. A physical lock on a computer or server room.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
