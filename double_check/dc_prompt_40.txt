Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural products that explicitly reference or incorporate elements of Reformed Epistemology in their core narrative or thematic structure.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A novel where the protagonist's journey to faith is portrayed as a basic, non-inferential belief, central to the plot.
2. A film that explores the concept of religious belief as properly basic, with characters debating the nature of faith without empirical evidence.
3. A play where the main conflict revolves around characters accepting religious beliefs as foundational and not requiring justification through reason.
4. A television series where the narrative arc focuses on the acceptance of religious beliefs as rational without needing evidential support, influencing character development.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A book that discusses the philosophy of religion in general terms.
6. A movie that explores the concept of faith but does not specifically address Reformed Epistemology.
7. A documentary about different religious practices around the world.
8. A podcast series on the history of Christian theology.
9. A novel where characters debate the existence of God using traditional arguments.
10. A film that focuses on the personal journey of faith without referencing any specific epistemological framework.
11. A play that examines the role of faith in society but does not delve into epistemological theories.
12. A television show that portrays various religious beliefs but does not focus on the rationality of belief without evidence.
13. A book that explores the concept of belief in general, without specific reference to Reformed Epistemology.
14. A movie that deals with the conflict between science and religion but does not mention Reformed Epistemology.
15. A documentary on the impact of religion on culture and society.
16. A podcast discussing the psychological aspects of belief.
17. A novel where characters struggle with their faith but do not discuss it in terms of Reformed Epistemology.
18. A film that portrays the journey of a character converting to a new religion without addressing epistemological issues.
19. A play that uses religious themes as a backdrop but does not focus on the rationality of belief.
20. A television series that explores different world religions but does not delve into specific epistemological theories.
21. A book that discusses the role of faith in personal development without referencing Reformed Epistemology.
22. A movie that examines the impact of religious beliefs on family dynamics.
23. A documentary on the history of religious conflicts.
24. A podcast that interviews people about their personal faith journeys without discussing epistemological frameworks.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
