Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Submerged ceramic objects designed for communication or containing messages.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A ceramic amphora with inscribed messages from ancient Greece
2. A ceramic tablet with cuneiform script submerged in a river
3. A sunken ceramic jar containing scrolls with encoded messages
4. A submerged ceramic vessel with hieroglyphs from an ancient civilization

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A clay pot used for cooking
6. A ceramic vase displayed in a museum
7. A porcelain teacup from a modern tea set
8. A terracotta warrior statue
9. A ceramic tile from a kitchen backsplash
10. A clay sculpture of a horse
11. A ceramic bowl used for serving food
12. A pottery shard found in a desert
13. A ceramic mug with a printed logo
14. A clay brick from an ancient building
15. A porcelain figurine of a dancer
16. A ceramic plate from a dinner set
17. A clay flower pot in a garden
18. A ceramic tile from a bathroom floor
19. A terracotta roof tile
20. A clay model of a car
21. A ceramic sculpture in a public park
22. A porcelain doll from a toy collection
23. A clay tablet with no inscriptions
24. A ceramic sink in a bathroom

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
