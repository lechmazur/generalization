Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Capital cities of countries that are named after saints and located in Central America.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. San José
2. San Salvador
3. San Pedro Sula
4. San Miguel

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Mexico City
6. Bogotá
7. Lima
8. Quito
9. Caracas
10. Panama City
11. Tegucigalpa
12. Managua
13. Guatemala City
14. Belmopan
15. Santo Domingo
16. San Juan
17. San Diego
18. San Francisco
19. San Antonio
20. San Cristóbal
21. San Andrés
22. San Marcos
23. San Ignacio
24. San Vicente

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
