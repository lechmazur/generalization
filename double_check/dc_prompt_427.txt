Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed to securely transmit or store something valuable using a hidden or concealed mechanism.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A hollowed-out book with a secret compartment for storing valuables.
2. A belt buckle that opens to reveal a hidden space for carrying cash.
3. A pen with a concealed compartment for storing small items like microfilm.
4. A wall clock with a false back used to hide important documents.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A safe deposit box at a bank.
6. A locked diary with a key.
7. A password-protected smartphone.
8. A traditional piggy bank.
9. A jewelry box with a lock.
10. A wallet with a zippered compartment.
11. A briefcase with a combination lock.
12. A file cabinet with a padlock.
13. A cash register with a drawer.
14. A strongbox with a key.
15. A locked toolbox.
16. A secure online cloud storage service.
17. A locked bicycle chain.
18. A padlocked storage unit.
19. A locked car glove compartment.
20. A locked medicine cabinet.
21. A locked liquor cabinet.
22. A locked gun safe.
23. A locked drawer in a desk.
24. A locked suitcase.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
