Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical objects designed with intentionally discontinuous surfaces to create a perception of fragmented forms reassembled in a new configuration.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A cubist sculpture of a woman's face with displaced geometric planes
2. A deconstructivist building with intersecting angular fragments
3. A ceramic vase with deliberately broken and reattached sections
4. A metal wall panel with intentionally misaligned geometric segments

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A jigsaw puzzle
6. A cracked mirror
7. A broken plate
8. A shattered window
9. A mosaic tile wall
10. A stained glass window
11. A collage artwork
12. A patchwork quilt
13. A terrazzo floor
14. A brick wall
15. An abstract painting
16. A kaleidoscope
17. A fractured rock
18. A pixelated digital image
19. A honeycomb structure
20. A chain link fence
21. A woven basket
22. A perforated metal sheet
23. A lattice screen
24. A segmented display screen

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
