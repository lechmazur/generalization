Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical phenomena that create repeating spiral patterns visible to the naked eye when viewed from above

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A hurricane viewed from a satellite
2. The spiral arms of a galaxy
3. A nautilus shell
4. A whirlpool in a draining bathtub

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A spiral staircase
6. A coiled spring
7. A corkscrew
8. A snail's trail
9. A roll of paper towels
10. A DNA molecule
11. A vine growing around a pole
12. A record groove
13. A spiral notebook binding
14. A barber pole
15. A tornado
16. A conch shell
17. A fingerprint whorl
18. A fern frond
19. A ram's horn
20. A coiled rope
21. A spiral-cut ham
22. A swirl of paint
23. A pinwheel
24. A cinnamon roll

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
