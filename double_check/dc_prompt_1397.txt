Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments that were invented specifically to help teach music theory concepts to students

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tonalpiano
2. Music Theory Keyboard
3. Chordophone
4. Intervallic Harp

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Piano
6. Guitar
7. Violin
8. Flute
9. Trumpet
10. Drum
11. Saxophone
12. Clarinet
13. Cello
14. Harp
15. Oboe
16. Bass Guitar
17. Tuba
18. Ukulele
19. Mandolin
20. Accordion
21. Banjo
22. Harmonica
23. Marimba
24. Xylophone

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
