Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that utilize electromagnetic waves to gather information from a distance without physical contact

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ground-penetrating radar
2. Doppler weather radar
3. Radio telescopes
4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Seismograph
6. Sonar
7. Telescope (optical)
8. Microscope
9. Barometer
10. Thermometer
11. Spectrometer
12. Mass spectrometer
13. Lidar
14. Infrared camera
15. Geiger counter
16. Satellite imagery (visible light)
17. Electron microscope
18. Hydrophone
19. Anemometer
20. Rain gauge
21. pH meter
22. Hygrometer
23. Wind vane
24. Ultrasound

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
