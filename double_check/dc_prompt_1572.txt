Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Algorithms directly inspired by the collective movement patterns of small flying insects

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Particle Swarm Optimization
2. Firefly Algorithm
3. Artificial Bee Colony
4. Mosquito Host-Seeking Algorithm

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ant Colony Optimization
6. Genetic Algorithm
7. Neural Networks
8. Simulated Annealing
9. Grey Wolf Optimizer
10. Bat Algorithm
11. Cuckoo Search
12. Spider Monkey Optimization
13. Whale Optimization Algorithm
14. Differential Evolution
15. Butterfly Optimization Algorithm
16. Fish School Search
17. Cat Swarm Optimization
18. Bacterial Foraging Algorithm
19. Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm
20. Bird Swarm Algorithm
21. Cockroach Swarm Optimization
22. Krill Herd Algorithm
23. Moth-Flame Optimization
24. Dragon Fly Algorithm

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
