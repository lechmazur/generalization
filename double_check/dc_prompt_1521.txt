Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that gradually accumulate layers of sediment or residue over decades while remaining mostly intact and visible underneath

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A submerged statue in a lake
2. An old shipwreck at the bottom of the ocean
3. A buried ancient tool in an archaeological site
4. An abandoned car in a desert

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A tree growing moss over time
6. A building covered in ivy
7. A river delta forming over centuries
8. A glacier accumulating snow and ice
9. A rock eroded by wind and sand
10. A painting that fades over time
11. A piece of metal that rusts
12. A fossil formed from an ancient organism
13. A mountain range shaped by tectonic forces
14. A coral reef growing over time
15. A cave with stalactites and stalagmites
16. A landfill accumulating waste
17. A city street covered in layers of asphalt
18. A book with pages yellowing over time
19. A wine bottle accumulating dust on a shelf
20. A piece of pottery that cracks and weathers
21. A bridge accumulating graffiti over the years
22. A field covered in layers of fallen leaves
23. A piece of driftwood washed up on a beach
24. A wall covered in posters and flyers

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
