Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural practices that involve rhythmic pounding or striking of grains to transform them into edible forms

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mortar and pestle used in West African fufu preparation
2. Japanese mochi pounding with kine and usu
3. Husking rice with a traditional wooden pestle in Southeast Asia
4. Grinding maize with a metate in Mesoamerican cultures

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Grinding coffee beans with a modern electric grinder
6. Using a blender to make a smoothie
7. Chopping vegetables with a knife
8. Using a rolling pin to flatten dough
9. Crushing garlic with a garlic press
10. Using a food processor to make hummus
11. Beating eggs with a whisk
12. Using a meat tenderizer on steak
13. Mixing batter with an electric mixer
14. Using a juicer to extract juice from fruits
15. Grinding spices with an electric spice grinder
16. Using a potato masher to mash potatoes
17. Crushing ice with an ice crusher
18. Using a mortar and pestle to make pesto
19. Using a cheese grater to shred cheese
20. Using a pasta maker to roll out pasta dough
21. Using a bread machine to knead dough
22. Using a stand mixer to knead bread dough
23. Using a hand-cranked coffee grinder
24. Using a nutcracker to crack nuts

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
