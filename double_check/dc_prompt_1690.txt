Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Annual festivals or celebrations that prominently feature paper decorations hung from above to represent celestial objects

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mid-Autumn Festival lanterns in Singapore
2. Tanabata paper stars in Japan
3. Mexican Christmas Las Posadas paper star pi√±atas
4. Taiwan Lantern Festival sky lanterns

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Diwali oil lamps
6. Chinese New Year door decorations
7. Valentine's Day paper hearts on walls
8. Mardi Gras beaded necklaces
9. Christmas tree ornaments
10. Halloween paper ghosts
11. Easter egg trees
12. Fourth of July bunting
13. Cinco de Mayo papel picado
14. New Year's Eve confetti
15. Birthday party streamers
16. Wedding paper flower walls
17. Carnival masks
18. Holi powder throws
19. Day of the Dead paper flags
20. Oktoberfest garlands
21. St. Patrick's Day shamrock decorations
22. Lunar New Year red envelopes
23. Ramadan crescents
24. Festival of Lights floating candles

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
