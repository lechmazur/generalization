Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that incorporate traditional craftsmanship techniques to serve a modern technological function

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a smartphone case handwoven with traditional Japanese bamboo techniques
2. a modern lamp featuring a hand-blown glass shade crafted using Venetian glassmaking methods
3. a smartwatch with a strap made using ancient leather tooling techniques
4. a Bluetooth speaker housed in a ceramic body shaped by traditional pottery methods

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a wooden rocking chair
6. a hand-knitted sweater
7. a hand-carved wooden bowl
8. a hand-painted ceramic vase
9. a traditional Japanese tea set
10. a handwoven basket
11. a hand-stitched leather wallet
12. a hand-forged iron skillet
13. a hand-embroidered tablecloth
14. a hand-carved wooden figurine
15. a hand-painted silk scarf
16. a handcrafted wooden chess set
17. a handwoven rug
18. a hand-blown glass ornament
19. a hand-carved stone sculpture
20. a hand-painted wooden mask
21. a hand-stitched quilt
22. a hand-forged sword
23. a hand-painted mural
24. a hand-carved wooden flute

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
