Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Events or phenomena that signify a sudden transition from chaos or activity to silence or stillness, often marking a significant change in perception or atmosphere.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The moment after a conductor signals the end of a symphony and the music stops.
2. A sudden power outage during a bustling city night.
3. The instant a snowstorm ceases, leaving a quiet, white landscape.
4. The abrupt silence following a firework display finale.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A sunrise over a calm ocean.
6. A bustling market at noon.
7. A gentle breeze rustling through leaves.
8. A crowded subway station during rush hour.
9. A waterfall cascading down a cliff.
10. A busy highway at peak traffic time.
11. A thunderstorm rolling in from the distance.
12. A lively concert in full swing.
13. A river flowing steadily through a valley.
14. A forest filled with the sounds of wildlife.
15. A bustling airport terminal.
16. A city park filled with children playing.
17. A crowded beach on a sunny day.
18. A parade marching down the street.
19. A busy restaurant during dinner service.
20. A train station with trains arriving and departing.
21. A festival with music and dancing.
22. A sports stadium during a game.
23. A construction site with machinery operating.
24. A classroom full of students during a lesson.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
