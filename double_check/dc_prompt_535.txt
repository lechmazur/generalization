Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate a naturally occurring spiral structure as a primary functional element.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A corkscrew
2. A spiral staircase
3. A DNA extraction kit
4. A spiral notebook

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A helical antenna
6. A coiled spring
7. A spiral galaxy model
8. A snail shell
9. A tornado simulation device
10. A spiral-shaped pasta
11. A nautilus shell
12. A spiral-bound book
13. A DNA molecule
14. A spiral ramp
15. A coiled telephone cord
16. A spiral water slide
17. A hurricane tracking map
18. A spiral-shaped candy
19. A coiled garden hose
20. A spiral-shaped architectural design
21. A DNA double helix model
22. A spiral-shaped wind turbine
23. A coiled electrical wire
24. A spiral-shaped seashell

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
