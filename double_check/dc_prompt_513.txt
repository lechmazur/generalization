Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures that incorporate a shallow pool of water designed to create a reflective surface, built between 1900 and 1950, and located in a capital city.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C.
2. The Canberra War Memorial's Pool of Reflection in Canberra, Australia
3. The Reflecting Pool at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, Mexico
4. The Reflecting Pool at the National Gallery in Ottawa, Canada

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A modern skyscraper with a rooftop pool in New York City
6. A natural lake used for reflection in a park in Paris
7. A fountain built in the 1960s in Rome
8. A pond in a botanical garden in Tokyo
9. A reflecting pool in a private estate built in the 1800s in London
10. A public swimming pool constructed in the 1970s in Berlin
11. A small decorative pool in a shopping mall in Beijing
12. A large artificial lake in a theme park in Orlando
13. A reflecting pool in a university campus built in the 1980s in Madrid
14. A pond in a residential area in Sydney
15. A water feature in a museum courtyard built in the 1990s in Cairo
16. A reflecting pool in a monastery garden in Dublin
17. A decorative pool in a hotel lobby in Las Vegas
18. A pond in a public park in Seoul
19. A reflecting pool in a corporate building constructed in the 2000s in Mumbai
20. A water feature in a historic site built in the 1850s in Athens
21. A pool in a community center in Johannesburg
22. A reflecting pool in a private garden in Buenos Aires
23. A pond in a nature reserve in Wellington
24. A water feature in a hospital built in the 2010s in Brussels

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
