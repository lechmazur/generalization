Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural or engineered systems that utilize specialized anchoring mechanisms to stabilize or secure themselves in dynamic environments.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Mangrove roots that anchor into coastal sediments to withstand tidal forces.
2. Climbing plants using tendrils to secure themselves to structures for support.
3. Ship anchors designed to hold vessels in place against currents and winds.
4. Gecko feet utilizing van der Waals forces to adhere to surfaces for climbing.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A tree's root system spreading out for stability.
6. A skyscraper's foundation designed to withstand earthquakes.
7. A satellite's orbit maintained by gravitational forces.
8. A car's seatbelt system for passenger safety.
9. A magnet attaching to a refrigerator door.
10. A spider web's silk threads for capturing prey.
11. A bridge's suspension cables for structural support.
12. A suction cup used to hang objects on smooth surfaces.
13. A climber's harness and rope system for safety.
14. A kite's string used to control its flight.
15. A barnacle's attachment to a whale's skin.
16. A Velcro fastening system on clothing.
17. A dam's structure to control water flow.
18. A bird's nest built in the fork of a tree.
19. A screw's threads for securing into wood.
20. A leech's ability to attach to a host.
21. A mountain climber's ice axe for stability on ice.
22. A balloon's string to keep it from floating away.
23. A lizard's ability to cling to walls.
24. A hook and loop fastener on a shoe.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
