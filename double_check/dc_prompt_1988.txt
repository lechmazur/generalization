Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Early 20th-century American poets who won the Pulitzer Prize multiple times

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Robert Frost
2. Edwin Arlington Robinson
3. Archibald MacLeish
4. Carl Sandburg

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Emily Dickinson
6. Walt Whitman
7. Langston Hughes
8. T.S. Eliot
9. Maya Angelou
10. Sylvia Plath
11. Ezra Pound
12. Wallace Stevens
13. William Carlos Williams
14. Gwendolyn Brooks
15. Robert Lowell
16. Marianne Moore
17. Edna St. Vincent Millay
18. Hart Crane
19. Allen Ginsberg
20. E.E. Cummings
21. Rita Dove
22. Louise Gl√ºck
23. Billy Collins
24. Sharon Olds

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
