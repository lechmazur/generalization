Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Physical spaces that were once regularly occupied but have been permanently abandoned while preserving most of their original contents

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Soviet research station in Antarctica with equipment and personal items left behind in 1992
2. The Pripyat amusement park in Ukraine with its untouched Ferris wheel and bumper cars
3. A 1950s Nevada desert diner with plates still on tables and coffee cups on counters
4. A Japanese elementary school on a remote island with books, desks, and teaching materials intact

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. An empty warehouse that was cleared out before closing
6. A demolished shopping mall
7. A renovated historic theater
8. An old factory converted into apartments
9. A closed museum with artifacts moved to storage
10. A vacant lot where a building once stood
11. A decommissioned military base that was properly cleared
12. An ancient Roman ruins site
13. A temporarily closed office building
14. A seasonal beach resort during winter
15. An emptied prison facility
16. A cleaned-out foreclosed home
17. A closed-down airport terminal
18. An empty school during summer break
19. A ghost town's stripped buildings
20. A bankrupt store after liquidation
21. A condemned building awaiting demolition
22. An archaeological dig site
23. A cleared monastery ruins
24. A cleaned-out abandoned mine

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
