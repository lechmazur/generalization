Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that exist in a state of suspension between two contrasting environments or realities

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The meniscus of water in a graduated cylinder
2. A soap bubble floating in the air
3. The thermocline in a lake
4. The aurora borealis in the Earth's atmosphere

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bridge connecting two landmasses
6. A person standing at a crossroads
7. A hybrid car
8. A bilingual dictionary
9. A person with dual citizenship
10. A chameleon changing colors
11. A person in a doorway
12. A river delta
13. A person on a seesaw
14. A person in a hammock
15. A person on a tightrope
16. A person in an elevator
17. A person at the beach where the water meets the sand
18. A person in a revolving door
19. A person on a swing
20. A person in a hot air balloon
21. A person on a trampoline
22. A person in a kayak
23. A person on a zip line
24. A person in a cable car

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
