Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or processes designed to prevent catastrophic failures that were themselves responsible for major disasters due to their complexity or misapplication

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, where the O-ring failure was exacerbated by cold weather conditions not adequately accounted for in the design and safety protocols.
2. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster, where the safety test procedure led to a power surge and subsequent explosion due to flaws in the reactor's design and safety systems.
3. The Therac-25 radiation therapy machine incidents, where software errors in the safety interlocks resulted in patients receiving lethal doses of radiation.
4. The Boeing 737 MAX crashes, where the MCAS system designed to enhance safety instead caused the aircraft to enter unrecoverable dives due to faulty sensor data and inadequate pilot training.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A car's airbag system that deploys correctly to prevent injury during a collision.
6. A fire suppression system in a building that successfully extinguishes a fire.
7. A backup generator that automatically activates during a power outage.
8. A safety harness used by construction workers to prevent falls.
9. A circuit breaker that trips to prevent electrical overloads.
10. A smoke detector that alerts occupants to a fire, allowing for safe evacuation.
11. A seatbelt that prevents injury during a car accident.
12. A pressure relief valve that prevents a boiler from exploding.
13. A child safety lock on a car door that prevents accidental opening.
14. A life jacket that keeps a person afloat in water.
15. A helmet that protects a cyclist's head during a fall.
16. A guardrail on a highway that prevents vehicles from veering off the road.
17. A safety net used by circus performers to catch them if they fall.
18. A ground fault circuit interrupter that prevents electrocution.
19. A safety switch on a power tool that prevents accidental activation.
20. A rollover protection system in a vehicle that protects occupants during a rollover accident.
21. A safety curtain in a theater that prevents the spread of fire.
22. A dead man's switch on a train that stops the train if the operator becomes incapacitated.
23. A safety valve on a scuba tank that prevents over-pressurization.
24. A safety interlock on a machine that prevents operation without proper guarding in place.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
