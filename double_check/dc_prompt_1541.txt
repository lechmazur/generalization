Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Festivals or events that began as small local gatherings and now draw over 300,000 international visitors annually while still maintaining their original location

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Oktoberfest in Munich
2. Edinburgh Festival Fringe
3. Carnival of Venice
4. Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. South by Southwest
6. Coachella Valley Music Festival
7. Burning Man
8. Ultra Music Festival Miami
9. Comic-Con International
10. Glastonbury Festival
11. Mardi Gras New Orleans
12. Rio Carnival
13. Tomorrowland Belgium
14. Electric Daisy Carnival
15. Sundance Film Festival
16. Toronto International Film Festival
17. Cannes Film Festival
18. Chinese New Year Parade San Francisco
19. St. Patrick's Day Parade NYC
20. Carnival of Brazil
21. Running of the Bulls Pamplona
22. Day of the Dead Mexico
23. Holi Festival India
24. Songkran Festival Thailand

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
