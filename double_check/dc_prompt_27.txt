Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Events or phenomena that occur exclusively during periods of continuous daylight or darkness in regions near the poles

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A specific type of aurora borealis display only visible during the polar night
2. The complete hibernation cycle of a certain Arctic ground squirrel species
3. A particular type of phytoplankton bloom occurring only during the midnight sun
4. Certain social rituals performed by an indigenous Arctic community exclusively during the period of continuous darkness

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Migration of caribou herds
6. The blooming of Arctic poppies
7. The formation of permafrost
8. The hunting behavior of polar bears
9. The nesting of Arctic terns
10. The growth of ice algae
11. Changes in sea ice extent
12. The behavior of narwhals
13. The life cycle of a mosquito in the Arctic
14. The molting of Arctic foxes
15. The emergence of insects in spring
16. The freezing of rivers and lakes
17. The thawing of snow in summer
18. The occurrence of blizzards
19. The formation of icebergs
20. The behavior of penguins
21. The breeding season of seals
22. The migration of whales
23. The changing of seasons
24. The Earth's axial tilt

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
