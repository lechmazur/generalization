Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): ancient structures used for competitive sports or games with religious significance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the Colosseum in Rome
2. the Stadium at Olympia
3. the Hippodrome of Constantinople
4. the Ball Court at Chichen Itza

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a Roman aqueduct
6. the Parthenon
7. Stonehenge
8. the Great Pyramid of Giza
9. a medieval jousting lance
10. a Greek amphora
11. a Viking longship
12. the Temple of Karnak
13. a Roman gladiator's helmet
14. the Acropolis
15. a Mayan calendar stone
16. a chariot wheel
17. the Sphinx
18. a Roman mosaic
19. a Greek theater mask
20. the Pantheon
21. a medieval castle
22. a Viking shield
23. the Temple of Artemis
24. a Roman coin

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
