Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Items or concepts that are used to create or represent a sense of calm or balance through mathematical or sensory means.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A perfectly symmetrical fractal image
2. A mobile perpetually balanced by precisely weighted objects
3. The Fibonacci sequence visualized as a spiral
4. White noise played at a consistent, low volume

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A yoga pose
6. A meditation cushion
7. A cup of chamomile tea
8. A weighted blanket
9. The sound of rain
10. A dimly lit room
11. A lavender scent
12. A nature scene painting
13. A ticking clock
14. A metronome
15. A swing set in motion
16. A spinning top
17. A perfectly still pond
18. A bonsai tree
19. A rock garden
20. An ocean wave
21. A gentle breeze
22. A field of wildflowers
23. A starry night sky
24. A single, sustained musical note

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
