Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative patterns created by overlapping circular shapes that gradually decrease in size while maintaining consistent spacing between elements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A series of concentric circles created with a spirograph, where the pen position is shifted inwards after each full rotation.
2. A target board design where each ring is slightly thinner than the one outside it, maintaining equal spacing between the rings.
3. A flower with petals shaped like teardrops, arranged in overlapping layers, each layer smaller than the last, with consistent spacing between the petal tips.
4. A digital graphic of shrinking, overlapping circles radiating outwards from a central point, each circle a consistent distance from the next.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A nautilus shell
6. A spiral staircase
7. A set of Russian nesting dolls
8. Concentric squares
9. A dartboard with varying widths between sections
10. A ripple effect in water
11. A tree's growth rings
12. A sunflower head
13. A pinecone
14. A fingerprint
15. A spiderweb
16. A chain link fence
17. A honeycomb
18. A tiled floor with hexagonal tiles
19. A series of overlapping ellipses
20. A bullseye pattern with irregular spacing
21. A fractal design
22. A kaleidoscope image
23. A series of nested triangles
24. A string of pearls

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
