Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or structures that are traditionally pulled by horses and have a designated area for a human operator to control movement

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. stagecoach
2. hansom cab
3. phaeton
4. surrey

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. rickshaw
6. chariot
7. ox cart
8. covered wagon
9. hay wagon
10. sled
11. bicycle
12. motorcycle
13. golf cart
14. forklift
15. tractor
16. wheelbarrow
17. bulldozer
18. train car
19. horse trailer
20. dog sled
21. Roman quadriga
22. palanquin
23. sedan chair
24. ski lift

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
