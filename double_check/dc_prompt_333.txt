Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made structures that convert a waste product of one process into a usable input for a different process, involving a chemical transformation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Anaerobic digester converting food waste to methane gas
2. Pyrolysis plant converting plastic waste to diesel fuel
3. Biorefinery converting agricultural residue to ethanol
4. Gasification unit converting sewage sludge to syngas

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Solar panel array
6. Recycling sorting facility
7. Compost bin
8. Water filtration plant
9. Mechanical shredder
10. Landfill gas collection system
11. Waste incinerator
12. Material recovery facility
13. Plastic recycling machine
14. Glass crusher
15. Paper pulping machine
16. Scrap metal smelter
17. Textile shredding machine
18. Waste heat exchanger
19. Wastewater treatment plant
20. Tire shredding facility
21. E-waste processing plant
22. Oil refinery
23. Biomass power plant
24. Chemical neutralization tank

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
