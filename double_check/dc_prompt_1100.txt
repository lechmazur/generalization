Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): performative art forms that use indirect representation to convey abstract or philosophical ideas through tangible, manipulable mediums

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. shadow puppetry
2. sand mandala creation
3. origami storytelling
4. ice sculpture performance

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. opera singing
6. stand-up comedy
7. oil painting
8. classical ballet
9. slam poetry
10. digital animation
11. street graffiti
12. photography
13. film directing
14. novel writing
15. jazz improvisation
16. mosaic art
17. ceramic pottery
18. theatrical play
19. modern dance
20. wood carving
21. fashion design
22. calligraphy
23. puppet theater
24. landscape gardening

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
