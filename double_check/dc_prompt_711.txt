Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or systems that involve the transformation or translation of information from one form to another to enhance understanding or efficiency

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Compiling source code into executable programs
2. Converting handwritten notes into typed text
3. Translating spoken language into another language
4. Transforming data into visual charts and graphs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Sending a letter through postal mail
6. Driving a car from one location to another
7. Cooking a meal following a recipe
8. Playing a musical instrument
9. Taking a photograph
10. Painting a picture
11. Building a house from blueprints
12. Solving a mathematical equation
13. Learning a new skill
14. Memorizing a poem
15. Reading a book
16. Writing a story
17. Watching a movie
18. Listening to music
19. Sharing a story verbally
20. Transferring files between computers
21. Delivering a package
22. Moving furniture from one room to another
23. Copying text from one document to another
24. Storing data on a hard drive

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
