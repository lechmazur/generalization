Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artifacts created specifically to facilitate the understanding of multiple languages or scripts simultaneously.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a Rosetta Stone replica
2. a multilingual dictionary
3. a parallel text translation app
4. a bilingual children's book

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a grammar textbook
6. a language learning podcast
7. a single-language dictionary
8. a handwriting recognition tool
9. a speech-to-text software
10. a phonetic alphabet chart
11. a language proficiency test
12. a monolingual storybook
13. a sign language interpreter
14. a translation memory database
15. a language exchange platform
16. a dialect map
17. a language origin chart
18. a word frequency list
19. a language family tree
20. a speech synthesis tool
21. a language history timeline
22. a monolingual thesaurus
23. a language learning game
24. a cultural phrasebook

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
