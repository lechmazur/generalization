Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer electronic devices that use polarized light to create visual displays through mechanical rotation

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A vintage View-Master reel viewer
2. A 1980s LCD pocket television
3. A Nintendo Game & Watch handheld console
4. A Soviet-era Elektronika IM-02 calculator watch

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A CRT television
6. An LED flashlight
7. A plasma display panel
8. An OLED smartphone screen
9. A digital projector
10. A pair of 3D glasses
11. A camera lens filter
12. A kaleidoscope
13. A prism
14. A polarizing microscope
15. A laser pointer
16. A fiber optic cable
17. A solar panel
18. A CD player
19. A vinyl record player
20. A cassette tape player
21. A digital camera
22. A camcorder
23. A pair of binoculars
24. A telescope

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
