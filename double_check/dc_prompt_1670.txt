Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Extinct mammals that were named after living celebrities in the 21st century

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Thylacoleo celebrity
2. Mammuthus star
3. Smilodon fame
4. Glyptodon icon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Extinct bird named after a historical figure
6. Living mammal named after a scientist
7. Extinct reptile named after a mythological character
8. Plant species named after a famous explorer
9. Fossil named after a geographical location
10. Extinct fish named after a fictional character
11. Living insect named after a politician
12. Extinct amphibian named after a poet
13. Mineral named after a Nobel laureate
14. Extinct invertebrate named after an artist
15. Living bird named after a musician
16. Extinct mammal named after a prehistoric tool
17. Plant named after a sports figure
18. Fossil named after a type of rock
19. Extinct reptile named after a type of environment
20. Living fish named after a chef
21. Extinct amphibian named after a type of water body
22. Insect named after a type of plant
23. Mineral named after a color
24. Extinct invertebrate named after a type of sediment

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
