Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Projects or constructions initiated by individuals named Jeff that have significantly impacted their respective fields.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a space exploration company revolutionizing reusable rocket technology
2. a streaming platform that transformed the entertainment industry
3. a global e-commerce platform that redefined online shopping
4. a social media network that changed how people connect online

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a skyscraper designed by a famous architect
6. a nonprofit organization focused on environmental conservation
7. a groundbreaking medical research institute
8. a popular video game developed by a small indie studio
9. a high-speed rail network connecting major cities
10. a renewable energy startup focused on solar power
11. a luxury car brand known for its innovative designs
12. a global fast-food chain expanding into new markets
13. a fashion brand that popularized sustainable clothing
14. a mobile app that simplifies personal finance management
15. a music streaming service with a vast library of songs
16. a tech company specializing in artificial intelligence
17. a theme park known for its immersive attractions
18. a publishing house that revolutionized the book industry
19. a fitness tracker that became a global phenomenon
20. a social enterprise addressing global poverty
21. a film studio producing award-winning movies
22. a smartphone brand known for its cutting-edge technology
23. a coffee chain that transformed the caf√© experience
24. a virtual reality headset that changed gaming

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
