Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Household appliances invented between 1890-1910 that incorporated oscillating motion as a key functional element

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Electric fan
2. Oscillating sprinkler
3. Electric sewing machine
4. Electric toothbrush

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Refrigerator
6. Vacuum cleaner
7. Washing machine
8. Toaster
9. Microwave oven
10. Electric kettle
11. Blender
12. Iron
13. Dishwasher
14. Hair dryer
15. Electric stove
16. Food processor
17. Electric mixer
18. Ceiling fan
19. Electric heater
20. Electric shaver
21. Electric blanket
22. Electric clock
23. Electric lamp
24. Electric typewriter

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
