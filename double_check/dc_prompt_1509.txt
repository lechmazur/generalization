Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Permanent human-made structures built above 12,000 feet elevation that are regularly occupied by workers or staff

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Sphinx Observatory in Switzerland
2. The Chacaltaya Astrophysical Observatory in Bolivia
3. The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
4. The University of Denver's High Altitude Laboratory

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A mountain cabin used recreationally
6. Mount Everest Base Camp
7. A radio tower on a mountain
8. The gondola lift station on Aiguille du Midi
9. A weather station atop Pikes Peak
10. The Burj Khalifa
11. An airplane
12. The International Space Station
13. A hot air balloon
14. A research aircraft flying at high altitude
15. A satellite orbiting Earth
16. A temporary research tent at high altitude
17. A high-altitude mine accessed by workers daily
18. A ski resort located above 12,000 feet
19. A mountain pass road above 12,000 feet
20. A high-altitude railway line
21. A remote mountain monastery
22. A high-altitude astronomical observatory only used for short observation periods
23. A military radar installation on a mountaintop
24. A communications relay station on a high mountain

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
