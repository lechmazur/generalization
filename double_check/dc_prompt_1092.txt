Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural practices or artifacts that originated in pre-Columbian civilizations and have persisted or been revived in modern contexts, often with significant symbolic or functional adaptations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The use of cacao in ceremonial drinks, which has evolved into modern chocolate production and consumption.
2. The practice of weaving intricate textiles, seen in contemporary fashion that incorporates traditional patterns and techniques.
3. The construction and use of adobe buildings, which continues in some regions and has inspired modern sustainable architecture.
4. The cultivation and use of maize in traditional and modern diets, symbolizing cultural continuity and adaptation.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The celebration of Dia de los Muertos, which has roots in indigenous traditions but has evolved significantly.
6. The use of traditional herbal remedies in modern alternative medicine practices.
7. The incorporation of indigenous motifs in contemporary art.
8. The revival of ancient languages in modern education systems.
9. The use of traditional musical instruments in modern music genres.
10. The adaptation of ancient agricultural techniques in modern organic farming.
11. The influence of ancient architectural styles on modern building designs.
12. The use of traditional storytelling methods in modern literature.
13. The integration of indigenous dance forms into contemporary dance performances.
14. The revival of ancient sports and games in modern recreational activities.
15. The use of traditional pottery techniques in modern ceramics.
16. The adaptation of ancient navigation methods in modern maritime practices.
17. The influence of ancient religious beliefs on modern spiritual practices.
18. The use of traditional weaving techniques in modern textile industries.
19. The incorporation of ancient symbols in modern jewelry design.
20. The revival of traditional cooking methods in modern cuisine.
21. The use of ancient medicinal plants in modern pharmaceuticals.
22. The influence of ancient social structures on modern community organizations.
23. The adaptation of traditional fishing methods in modern aquaculture.
24. The use of ancient dyeing techniques in modern fashion.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
