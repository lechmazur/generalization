Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Activities or practices that involve balancing on a narrow or unstable surface while maintaining continuous motion.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. tightrope walking
2. skateboarding
3. slacklining
4. surfing

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. jogging
6. cycling
7. swimming
8. rock climbing
9. skiing
10. hiking
11. kayaking
12. rollerblading
13. yoga
14. rowing
15. basketball
16. golfing
17. fencing
18. horseback riding
19. archery
20. badminton
21. tennis
22. volleyball
23. soccer
24. baseball

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
