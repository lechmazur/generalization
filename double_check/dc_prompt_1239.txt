Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures or systems that utilize rotational symmetry in three-dimensional space to achieve functional or aesthetic balance.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Ferris wheel
2. Gyroscope
3. Wind turbine
4. Spinning top

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. pyramid
6. cube
7. rectangular prism
8. tetrahedron
9. parallelogram
10. cone
11. cylinder
12. hexagonal prism
13. octahedron
14. triangular prism
15. rectangular pyramid
16. trapezoid
17. ellipsoid
18. paraboloid
19. torus
20. icosahedron
21. rhombus
22. pentagonal prism
23. heptagon
24. nonagon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
