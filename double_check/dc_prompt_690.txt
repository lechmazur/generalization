Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Women who were pioneers in computer programming languages and have received a major award for their contributions to computer science.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Frances Allen
2. Barbara Liskov
3. Jean Sammet
4. Grace Hopper

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ada Lovelace
6. Margaret Hamilton
7. Karen Sp√§rck Jones
8. Donald Knuth
9. Betty Holberton
10. Adele Goldberg
11. Alan Turing
12. John McCarthy
13. Marvin Minsky
14. Radia Perlman
15. Anita Borg
16. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller
17. Stephanie Shirley
18. Carol Shaw
19. Evelyn Boyd Granville
20. Lynn Conway
21. Fran Allen
22. Sophie Wilson
23. Mary Allen Wilkes
24. Kathleen Booth

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
