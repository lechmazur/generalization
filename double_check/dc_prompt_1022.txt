Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Events or concepts that mark a significant shift in human capability or perspective, often involving a leap into the unknown or a redefinition of boundaries.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The invention of the printing press
2. The Apollo 11 moon landing
3. The discovery of penicillin
4. The development of the internet

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The Industrial Revolution
6. The Renaissance
7. The invention of the wheel
8. The discovery of electricity
9. The creation of the first computer
10. The fall of the Berlin Wall
11. The signing of the Magna Carta
12. The invention of the telephone
13. The discovery of DNA structure
14. The first flight by the Wright brothers
15. The development of the steam engine
16. The invention of the light bulb
17. The discovery of gravity
18. The creation of the first vaccine
19. The invention of the airplane
20. The discovery of the New World
21. The invention of the camera
22. The development of the atomic bomb
23. The invention of the automobile
24. The discovery of the Higgs boson

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
