Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed for human use that incorporate a continuous, unbroken loop of flexible material as a primary functional component.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a lasso
2. a rubber band
3. a keychain
4. a wristwatch strap

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a belt
6. a necklace
7. a shoelace
8. a rope
9. a chain
10. a bracelet
11. a zip tie
12. a carabiner
13. a bungee cord
14. a hair tie
15. a fishing net
16. a hula hoop
17. a jump rope
18. a dog leash
19. a pulley system
20. a slingshot
21. a rubber hose
22. a garden hose
23. a cable
24. a wire

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
