Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that fundamentally alter human perception of distance and space.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. the telescope
2. virtual reality headsets
3. Google Earth
4. GPS navigation systems

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the wheel
6. steam engine
7. compass
8. telegraph
9. microscope
10. radio
11. automobile
12. airplane
13. television
14. computer
15. smartphone
16. digital camera
17. submarine
18. space shuttle
19. binoculars
20. radar
21. sonar
22. satellite
23. drone
24. hot air balloon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
