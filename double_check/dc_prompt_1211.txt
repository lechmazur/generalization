Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Systems or structures that rely on tension or suspension to maintain their form or function, where the integrity of the system depends on the balance of opposing forces.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A suspension bridge
2. A tensegrity structure
3. A violin
4. An arch

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bicycle chain
6. A zipper
7. A shoelace
8. A rubber band
9. A spring
10. A lever
11. A pulley system
12. A gear system
13. A magnetic levitation train
14. An airplane wing
15. A hot air balloon
16. A submarine
17. A dam
18. A building foundation
19. A tree
20. The human skeleton
21. A spider web
22. A soap bubble
23. A balloon animal
24. A geodesic dome

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
