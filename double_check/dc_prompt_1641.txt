Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional vocal techniques that involve rapid alternation between chest voice and falsetto while maintaining continuous sound

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Tuvan throat singing (specifically, the Sygyt style)
2. Swiss yodeling
3. Kyrgyzstanic kumail
4. Sardinian "cantu a tenore" (specifically, the "bassu" voice)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Opera singing (general)
6. Belting (in musical theatre)
7. Sprechstimme
8. Beatboxing
9. Scat singing
10. Overtone singing
11. Growling (in death metal)
12. Khoomei (general Mongolian throat singing)
13. Bulgarian polyphony
14. Gregorian chant
15. Throat singing (generic term)
16. Vocal fry
17. Vibrato
18. Portamento
19. Glissando
20. Melisma
21. Rapping
22. Blues singing
23. Jazz singing
24. Country singing

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
