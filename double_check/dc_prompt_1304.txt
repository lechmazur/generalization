Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine historical craftsmanship with modern reinterpretation, resulting in a hybrid form that preserves traditional techniques while incorporating contemporary innovation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a kimono redesigned with digital printing techniques
2. a handcrafted wooden chair with 3D-printed joints
3. a ceramic vase featuring traditional glazing methods and modern geometric patterns
4. a leather handbag combining ancient tanning processes with futuristic design elements

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a vintage typewriter
6. a modern smartphone
7. a traditional Japanese tea set
8. a contemporary abstract painting
9. a medieval sword
10. a futuristic electric car
11. a handwoven Persian rug
12. a minimalist concrete building
13. a Renaissance-era oil painting
14. a high-tech smartwatch
15. a classic vinyl record player
16. a modern glass sculpture
17. a traditional Chinese calligraphy brush
18. a cutting-edge drone
19. a hand-carved wooden mask
20. a sleek aluminum laptop
21. a Baroque-style chandelier
22. a 3D-printed prosthetic limb
23. a hand-painted porcelain plate
24. a futuristic holographic display

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
