Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural artifacts that incorporate natural materials and symbolize respect or reverence in their respective cultures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Eagle feather prayer fan used in Native American ceremonies
2. Japanese bamboo tea whisk for traditional tea ceremonies
3. Aboriginal Australian message stick made from eucalyptus wood
4. Tibetan prayer beads carved from sacred bodhi tree seeds

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Stone sculpture of Buddha
6. Celtic cross necklace
7. Plastic ceremonial mask
8. Glass prayer beads
9. Metal incense burner
10. Synthetic drum
11. Ceramic offering bowl
12. Factory-made prayer flags
13. Modern dreamcatcher
14. Painted wooden idol
15. Crystal healing stones
16. Bronze ritual bell
17. Silk ceremonial robe
18. Brass meditation bowl
19. Paper origami crane
20. Silver ritual dagger
21. Plastic prayer wheel
22. Cotton prayer shawl
23. Steel ceremonial sword
24. Porcelain ritual vessel

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
