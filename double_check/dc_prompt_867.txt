Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that facilitate the transmission of data across vast distances without direct human intervention

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. satellite communication
2. fiber optic cables
3. radio waves
4. cellular networks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. telegraph
6. smoke signals
7. carrier pigeons
8. postal mail
9. walkie-talkies
10. semaphore flags
11. morse code
12. fax machines
13. landline telephones
14. drums for communication
15. television broadcasting
16. internet routers
17. Bluetooth devices
18. Wi-Fi networks
19. undersea cables
20. television remote controls
21. megaphones
22. public address systems
23. light signals
24. smoke detectors

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
