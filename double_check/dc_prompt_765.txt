Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that are used to store or transport substances and have a mechanism to control the release of their contents

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. spray bottle
2. ketchup dispenser
3. gasoline pump nozzle
4. perfume atomizer

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. plastic water bottle
6. cardboard box
7. shopping bag
8. glass jar
9. metal can
10. wooden crate
11. ceramic vase
12. plastic bucket
13. paper envelope
14. cloth sack
15. tin canister
16. plastic wrap
17. aluminum foil
18. cardboard tube
19. glass bottle
20. plastic tub
21. wooden barrel
22. metal flask
23. ceramic pot
24. plastic container

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
