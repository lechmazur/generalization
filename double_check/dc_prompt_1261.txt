Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): systems or platforms that use iterative feedback loops to optimize user outcomes or performance

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a fitness app that adjusts workout plans based on user progress and feedback
2. a recommendation algorithm that refines suggestions based on user interactions
3. a language learning platform that adapts lessons based on user performance
4. a smart thermostat that learns user preferences and adjusts settings accordingly

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a static user manual for a software application
6. a one-time survey for customer feedback
7. a traditional classroom lecture without assessments
8. a basic calculator with fixed functions
9. a non-adaptive video game with linear gameplay
10. a printed map without real-time updates
11. a manual car transmission system
12. a recipe book with no user customization options
13. a standard alarm clock without snooze functionality
14. a fixed-speed treadmill
15. a non-interactive e-learning video
16. a basic to-do list app without reminders
17. a traditional vending machine with no user preferences
18. a static billboard advertisement
19. a manual thermostat with no learning capabilities
20. a non-personalized email newsletter
21. a standard stopwatch with no performance tracking
22. a basic flashlight app with no adjustable settings
23. a traditional board game with fixed rules
24. a non-adaptive traffic light system

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
