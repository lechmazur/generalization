Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic spouses who collaborated on major Art Nouveau furniture or interior design projects between 1890-1920

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Margaret and Frances Macdonald with Charles Rennie Mackintosh
2. Koloman and Danica Moser
3. Louis Comfort and Anne Weston Tiffany
4. Josef and Josefine Hoffmann

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gustav and Alma Mahler
6. William and Jane Morris
7. Claude and Camille Monet
8. Auguste Rodin and Camille Claudel
9. Wassily and Nina Kandinsky
10. Sonia and Robert Delaunay
11. Emile Gallé
12. René Lalique and Augustine-Alice Ledru
13. Victor Horta and Maria Michelat
14. Henry van de Velde and Maria Sèthe
15. Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo
16. Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe
17. Theo van Doesburg and Nelly van Moorsel
18. Raoul and Madeline Dufy
19. Paul and Clara Klee
20. Georges Braque and Marcelle Lapré
21. Hector Guimard and Adeline Oppenheim
22. Antoni Gaudí
23. Charles and Ray Eames
24. Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
