Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things named after scientists that are not directly related to their field of study

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Avogadro's number (named after chemist Avogadro, but used in physics)
2. Euler characteristic (named after mathematician Euler, but used in topology)
3. Doppler effect (named after physicist Doppler, but used in astronomy)
4. Pascal's law (named after mathematician Pascal, but used in fluid mechanics)

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Newton's laws of motion
6. Einstein's theory of relativity
7. Boyle's law
8. Planck constant
9. Mendel's laws of inheritance
10. Darwin's theory of evolution
11. Kepler's laws of planetary motion
12. Ohm's law
13. Faraday's law of induction
14. Maxwell's equations
15. Pythagoras theorem
16. Gauss's law
17. Heisenberg uncertainty principle
18. Schr√∂dinger equation
19. Hooke's law
20. Archimedes principle
21. Bernoulli's principle
22. Coulomb's law
23. Ampere's law
24. Pauli exclusion principle

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
