Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional songs used by indigenous groups to coordinate hunting activities involving specific animals

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Yol≈ãu kangaroo hunting song from Arnhem Land
2. Inuit seal hunting chant from Greenland
3. Maasai lion tracking song from Kenya
4. Apache deer stalking song from Arizona

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Amazing Grace
6. Maori war dance haka
7. Aboriginal dreamtime story song
8. Native American rain dance song
9. Traditional fishing net weaving song
10. Celtic harvest gathering tune
11. African drum signal for village meeting
12. Indigenous wedding ceremony song
13. Traditional whaling shanty
14. Tribal coming of age ceremony music
15. Ancient farming work song
16. Traditional healing ceremony chant
17. Tribal victory celebration song
18. Sacred animal spirit dance music
19. Traditional gathering basket weaving song
20. Ancient forest prayer chant
21. Traditional boat building work song
22. Tribal funeral ceremony music
23. Ancient food preparation song
24. Traditional fire making ritual chant

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
