Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects constructed using a repeating interlocking pattern of identical tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron shares at least three faces with other tetrahedra.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A geometric sculpture made from a repeating pattern of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron shares at least three faces with others, forming a complex three-dimensional lattice.
2. An architectural model constructed from a series of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron is connected to at least three others, creating a stable and intricate structure.
3. A mathematical model demonstrating the properties of space-filling using a pattern of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron shares at least three faces with adjacent tetrahedra.
4. A decorative art piece composed of a repeating pattern of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron is connected to at least three others, forming an aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound design.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A chain-link fence made from interlocking metal links.
6. A honeycomb structure composed of hexagonal cells.
7. A woven basket made from interlocking strips of material.
8. A molecular model of a diamond, showing the tetrahedral arrangement of carbon atoms.
9. A geodesic dome constructed from triangular panels.
10. A jigsaw puzzle with interlocking pieces.
11. A brick wall where each brick interlocks with adjacent bricks.
12. A 3D printed object made from layers of interlocking plastic.
13. A fabric weave where threads interlock to form a pattern.
14. A modular building system using interlocking blocks.
15. A crystal lattice structure where atoms are arranged in a repeating pattern.
16. A Lego structure built from interlocking plastic bricks.
17. A chainmail armor made from interlocking metal rings.
18. A tessellation pattern on a flat surface using interlocking shapes.
19. A molecular model of water, showing the tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
20. A wooden puzzle where pieces interlock to form a complete shape.
21. A knitted fabric where yarn loops interlock to form a pattern.
22. A modular shelving unit made from interlocking components.
23. A mosaic made from interlocking tiles.
24. A molecular model of methane, showing the tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms around a carbon atom.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
