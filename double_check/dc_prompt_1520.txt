Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artificial objects designed to operate autonomously in extreme environments that successfully completed their mission despite having no human maintenance for over 1000 days

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Voyager 1 space probe
2. Viking 1 Mars lander
3. Pioneer 10 spacecraft
4. Opportunity Mars rover

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. International Space Station
6. Hubble Space Telescope
7. Deep sea monitoring buoy
8. Weather satellite
9. Underwater pipeline sensor
10. Arctic research station
11. Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
12. GPS satellite
13. Deep ocean thermal vent monitor
14. Curiosity Mars rover
15. NOAA weather buoy
16. Perseverance Mars rover
17. Cassini spacecraft
18. Mariner 4 probe
19. Automated volcano monitoring station
20. Desert solar monitoring system
21. Antarctic seismic sensor
22. Deep mine gas detector
23. Autonomous underwater vehicle
24. High-altitude weather balloon

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
