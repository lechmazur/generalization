Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural materials or objects that have been historically used or collected for their aesthetic or cultural value despite lacking intrinsic monetary worth

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Sea glass
2. Bird feathers
3. Unusual stones or pebbles
4. Driftwood

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Gold nuggets
6. Diamonds
7. Seashells (commonly collected, but some have monetary value)
8. Antique furniture
9. Stamps
10. Coins
11. Baseball cards
12. Beanie Babies (some have perceived value)
13. Fossil fuels
14. Timber
15. Iron ore
16. Quartz crystals (some are valuable)
17. Flowers (some are commercially valuable)
18. Herbs (some are commercially valuable)
19. Animal hides
20. Ivory
21. Amber (some contains valuable inclusions)
22. Sand
23. Water
24. Air

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
