Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Things that are traditionally used for both practical purposes and decorative arts in rural settings.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. quilt
2. ceramic vase
3. woven basket
4. iron lantern

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. plastic chair
6. electric fan
7. digital clock
8. stainless steel refrigerator
9. LED light bulb
10. microwave oven
11. plastic storage bin
12. aluminum ladder
13. electric kettle
14. plastic water bottle
15. smartphone
16. television
17. blender
18. vacuum cleaner
19. electric guitar
20. plastic cutting board
21. synthetic rug
22. metal filing cabinet
23. digital camera
24. plastic flower pot

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
