Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or artifacts that bear visible marks of a specific, singular event or process that altered their original form or function in a way that is now permanently preserved.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A charred wooden beam from a historic building struck by lightning
2. A cracked Liberty Bell displaying its famous fracture
3. A fossilized leaf with visible insect bite marks
4. A bullet-pierced helmet from World War II

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A weathered stone statue
6. A rusted car
7. An old leather book
8. A faded photograph
9. A scratched vinyl record
10. A chipped coffee mug
11. A broken window
12. A dented trash can
13. A torn canvas painting
14. A cracked smartphone screen
15. A stained carpet
16. An eroded cliff face
17. A bent street sign
18. A worn doorknob
19. A patinated copper roof
20. A sun-bleached billboard
21. A warped vinyl record
22. A moth-eaten sweater
23. A water-damaged book
24. A scratched DVD

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
