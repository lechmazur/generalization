Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural or mythological narratives that explain the origin of humanity or significant societal structures through symbolic or allegorical storytelling.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
2. The Maori creation myth of Ranginui and Papatūānuku
3. The Norse myth of Ymir and the creation of the world from his body
4. The Hopi emergence tale of the Spider Woman guiding humans to the surface world

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table
6. The tale of the Trojan War in Greek mythology
7. The story of the Great Flood in Mesopotamian mythology
8. The myth of Prometheus stealing fire for humanity
9. The legend of the Phoenix rising from its ashes
10. The story of the Minotaur in the Labyrinth
11. The myth of the Sphinx and her riddles
12. The tale of the Golden Fleece and Jason's quest
13. The legend of the founding of Rome by Romulus and Remus
14. The story of the Hindu god Krishna's childhood adventures
15. The myth of the Egyptian god Osiris and his resurrection
16. The tale of the Chinese Monkey King's journey to the West
17. The legend of the Norse god Thor's battles with giants
18. The story of the Greek hero Perseus slaying Medusa
19. The myth of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl creating humanity
20. The tale of the Japanese sun goddess Amaterasu emerging from a cave
21. The legend of the Celtic hero Cú Chulainn
22. The story of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar descending to the underworld
23. The myth of the Greek Titan Atlas holding up the sky
24. The tale of the Inuit sea goddess Sedna and her creation of sea creatures

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
