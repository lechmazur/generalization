Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Games or activities from ancient civilizations that involve a spherical object and have been revived or adapted in modern times for cultural or educational purposes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Episkyros
2. Tlachtli
3. Cuju
4. Kemari

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Chess
6. Senet
7. Mancala
8. Discus throwing
9. Javelin throwing
10. Knucklebones
11. Polo
12. Wrestling
13. Archery
14. Dice games
15. Pankration
16. Hoop rolling
17. Kites
18. Nine men's morris
19. Tug of war
20. Hopscotch
21. Go
22. Backgammon
23. Bowling pins
24. Juggling

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
