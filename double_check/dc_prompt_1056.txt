Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Geometric structures or phenomena that exhibit both symmetry and a central point of convergence or divergence.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A perfectly formed snowflake
2. A spiral galaxy
3. Concentric circles emanating from a dropped pebble in water
4. A regular star polygon

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A spiderweb (irregular)
6. A tree
7. A river delta
8. A human circulatory system
9. A lightning strike
10. A fractal, such as the Mandelbrot set
11. A sunflower head (spiral arrangement, not strictly convergent/divergent from a central point)
12. A pinecone (spiral arrangement)
13. A nautilus shell (spiral)
14. A fern leaf
15. A network of roads intersecting at a roundabout
16. The spokes of a bicycle wheel
17. A dandelion seed head (after dispersal)
18. A fireworks explosion
19. A magnetic field around a bar magnet
20. A topographical map showing contour lines
21. The veins on a leaf
22. A crystal lattice (repeating unit, not necessarily convergent/divergent)
23. A honeycomb (tessellation)
24. A kaleidoscope image

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
