Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Coastal resort towns in Europe founded on ancient Iberian settlements

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Denia, Spain
2. Cartagena, Spain
3. Almuñécar, Spain
4. Empúries, Spain

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Santorini, Greece
6. Nice, France
7. Barcelona, Spain
8. Portofino, Italy
9. Dubrovnik, Croatia
10. Monte Carlo, Monaco
11. Mykonos, Greece
12. Amalfi, Italy
13. Malaga, Spain
14. Ibiza, Spain
15. Valencia, Spain
16. Marbella, Spain
17. St. Tropez, France
18. Cannes, France
19. Seville, Spain
20. Capri, Italy
21. Majorca, Spain
22. Positano, Italy
23. Corfu, Greece
24. Rimini, Italy

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
