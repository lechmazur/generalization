Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): phenomena or objects that create the illusion of depth, transformation, or infinity through layered or repeating patterns, despite being physically finite or static

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Escher's "Relativity" artwork
2. A fractal pattern
3. A holographic image
4. A kaleidoscope view

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A single mirror
6. A flat painting
7. A photograph
8. A sculpture
9. A shadow
10. A rainbow
11. A prism
12. A magnifying glass
13. A telescope
14. A microscope
15. A stained glass window
16. A single layer cake
17. A mosaic
18. A single pane of glass
19. A silhouette
20. A single color gradient
21. A simple pattern
22. A single note of music
23. A single line drawing
24. A plain wall

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
