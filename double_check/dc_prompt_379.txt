Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Man-made objects designed for remote sensing that utilize electromagnetic radiation outside the visible spectrum.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. FLIR thermal imaging camera
2. millimeter-wave body scanner
3. microwave radiometer
4. X-ray backscatter device

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. telescope
6. microscope
7. magnifying glass
8. binoculars
9. digital camera
10. radar gun
11. radio telescope
12. spectrometer
13. barcode scanner
14. night vision goggles
15. motion sensor
16. smoke detector
17. UV light
18. laser pointer
19. metal detector
20. seismograph
21. sonar device
22. periscope
23. kaleidoscope
24. endoscope

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
