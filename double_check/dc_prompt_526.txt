Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Electro-mechanical devices designed for automated street cleaning that utilize rotating brushes for primary debris collection.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Street sweeper with a rotating brush system for debris collection
2. Automated sidewalk cleaner using a cylindrical brush for sweeping
3. Urban road cleaning machine equipped with a rotating brush mechanism
4. Municipal street cleaner with a front-mounted rotating brush for debris removal

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Robotic vacuum cleaner with a rotating brush for home use
6. Industrial floor scrubber with rotating brushes
7. Automated car wash system using rotating brushes
8. Leaf blower with a rotating brush attachment
9. Manual push broom with rotating bristles
10. Lawn mower with a rotating blade for grass cutting
11. Pool cleaner robot with a rotating brush for pool maintenance
12. Street washing vehicle using high-pressure water jets
13. Automated gutter cleaning system with a rotating brush
14. Conveyor belt system with rotating brushes for cleaning
15. Window cleaning robot with rotating brushes
16. Snow plow with a rotating brush for snow removal
17. Automated carpet cleaner with rotating brushes
18. Street marking machine with a rotating brush for paint application
19. Industrial dust collector with rotating brushes
20. Automated shoe polisher with rotating brushes
21. Street lighting system with automated cleaning
22. Automated trash compactor with a rotating mechanism
23. Street surveillance camera with a rotating base
24. Automated graffiti removal system using rotating brushes

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
