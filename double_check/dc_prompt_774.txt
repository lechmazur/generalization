Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Materials or systems that exhibit emergent properties through dynamic reconfiguration of their internal structure in response to external stimuli.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Shape-memory alloys that change their configuration in response to temperature changes
2. Self-healing polymers that restructure their molecular bonds when damaged
3. Photonic crystals that alter their optical properties through structural changes induced by light
4. Magnetorheological fluids that modify their viscosity in response to magnetic fields

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Smartphones that adapt their interface based on user behavior
6. Thermostats that adjust temperature settings based on room conditions
7. Traffic systems that change light timings based on traffic flow
8. Robots that modify their actions based on sensor input
9. Weather forecasting models that update predictions with new data
10. Neural networks that adjust weights during learning
11. Automated stock trading systems that react to market changes
12. Smart grids that balance electricity distribution based on demand
13. Autonomous vehicles that alter routes based on traffic conditions
14. Home security systems that change alert levels based on detected activity
15. Interactive educational software that adapts to student performance
16. Climate control systems that adjust based on external weather
17. Water purification systems that modify filtration based on water quality
18. Smart fabrics that change color based on environmental conditions
19. Augmented reality systems that adjust visuals based on user movement
20. Energy management systems that optimize usage based on time of day
21. Health monitoring devices that alert based on vital signs
22. Smart lighting systems that adjust brightness based on ambient light
23. Automated irrigation systems that water based on soil moisture
24. Voice recognition systems that adapt to different accents

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
