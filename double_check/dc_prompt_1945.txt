Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional garments worn during specific cultural festivals in East Asia

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a hanbok worn during Chuseok
2. a qipao worn during the Spring Festival
3. a yukata worn during the Gion Matsuri
4. a hanfu worn during the Mid-Autumn Festival

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a kimono worn at a wedding
6. a sari worn during Diwali
7. a kilt worn at a Highland Games event
8. a dirndl worn during Oktoberfest
9. a dashiki worn during Kwanzaa
10. a poncho worn during a Mexican Independence Day celebration
11. a keffiyeh worn during Eid al-Fitr
12. a barong Tagalog worn during a Filipino fiesta
13. a cheongsam worn at a formal dinner
14. a thobe worn during Ramadan
15. a salwar kameez worn during Eid
16. a ao dai worn at a graduation ceremony
17. a kebaya worn during a traditional dance performance
18. a sarong worn at a beach festival
19. a traje de flamenca worn during the Feria de Abril
20. a baju kurung worn during a Malay wedding
21. a chiton worn during a Greek Orthodox Easter celebration
22. a parka worn during a winter solstice festival
23. a kente cloth worn during a Ghanaian naming ceremony
24. a huipil worn during a Day of the Dead celebration

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
