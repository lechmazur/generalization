Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Biological processes that occur in sequential stages and are disrupted by motion sickness

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Cell division
2. Embryonic development
3. Photosynthesis
4. Menstrual cycle

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Weather patterns
6. Traffic flow
7. Chemical reactions
8. Economic cycles
9. Software development lifecycle
10. Seasons of the year
11. Stages of grief
12. Plant growth
13. Healing process of a wound
14. Water cycle
15. Food digestion
16. Learning process
17. Manufacturing process
18. Construction phases
19. Stages of sleep
20. Project management phases
21. Life stages of insects
22. Star life cycle
23. Political election cycles
24. Market trends

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
