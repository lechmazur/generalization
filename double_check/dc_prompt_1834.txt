Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Interactive art installations that utilize physical manipulation to create visual patterns

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Visitors can twist and turn a series of interconnected gears to generate intricate geometric designs projected onto a wall.
2. A large, transparent touch-sensitive surface allows users to draw patterns with their fingers, which are then transformed into colorful light displays.
3. Participants manipulate a series of levers and pulleys to control the movement of light beams, creating dynamic shadow patterns on a screen.
4. By physically moving magnetic tiles on a board, users can alter the flow of electric currents, resulting in changing visual patterns displayed on an LED matrix.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Interactive digital art that responds to sound input to create visual effects.
6. A virtual reality experience where users can paint in a 3D environment.
7. An art installation that changes colors based on the time of day.
8. A sculpture that rotates to reveal different images as it moves.
9. A mural that uses augmented reality to add interactive elements visible through a smartphone app.
10. An exhibit where visitors can control the playback of a video by moving a joystick.
11. A light installation that changes patterns based on the temperature in the room.
12. A kinetic sculpture that moves in response to wind, creating changing shadows.
13. An interactive floor projection that reacts to people walking over it, but does not create visual patterns.
14. A digital painting that evolves over time without user interaction.
15. An art piece that uses sensors to detect movement and trigger sound effects.
16. A gallery where visitors can use a tablet to select different artworks to be displayed on a screen.
17. An installation where the audience can vote on which artwork to display next.
18. A piece that uses facial recognition to change the displayed image based on the viewer's expression.
19. An exhibit where visitors can add their own drawings to a communal digital canvas.
20. A sculpture that changes color when touched, but does not create visual patterns.
21. An interactive game where players can manipulate virtual objects on a screen.
22. A light show that is controlled by a pre-programmed sequence, not by physical manipulation.
23. An installation where visitors can record their voices to be part of a sound collage.
24. A piece of art that uses water flow to create dynamic shapes, but not visual patterns controlled by physical manipulation.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
