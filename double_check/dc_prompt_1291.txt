Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artistic or theoretical movements that intentionally juxtapose contradictory or paradoxical elements to evoke emotional or intellectual tension.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Surrealism, with its dreamlike combinations of incongruous elements, such as Salvador Dalí's melting clocks.
2. Dadaism, exemplified by Marcel Duchamp's "Fountain," which challenges the notion of art through the use of a urinal.
3. Postmodern architecture, like the Vanna Venturi House, which combines classical and modern elements in a way that creates visual tension.
4. The literary technique of magical realism, as seen in Gabriel García Márquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude," where fantastical events are juxtaposed with realistic settings.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Impressionism, with its focus on capturing the effects of light and atmosphere.
6. Abstract expressionism, known for its spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation.
7. Cubism, which breaks objects and scenes into geometric shapes and reassembles them.
8. Futurism, which celebrates speed, technology, and industrialism.
9. Minimalism, characterized by simplicity and a focus on essential elements.
10. Pop Art, which incorporates imagery from popular culture.
11. Conceptual Art, where the idea or concept behind the work is more important than the finished product.
12. Expressionism, which emphasizes the artist's inner experiences and emotions.
13. Constructivism, which focuses on art as a practice for social purposes.
14. Bauhaus, known for its integration of art, craft, and technology.
15. Realism, which aims to depict subjects as they appear in everyday life.
16. Neoclassicism, which draws inspiration from the classical art and culture of Ancient Greece and Rome.
17. Romanticism, which emphasizes emotion and individualism.
18. Baroque, known for its grandeur, drama, and ornate detail.
19. Renaissance, which revived interest in classical learning and values.
20. Gothic, characterized by its dark, mysterious, and often supernatural themes.
21. Art Nouveau, which features organic, flowing lines and natural forms.
22. De Stijl, known for its use of primary colors and geometric shapes.
23. Fauvism, which uses bold, non-naturalistic colors.
24. Op Art, which creates optical illusions through the use of patterns and color.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
