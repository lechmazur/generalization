Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Concepts or structures that symbolize the tension between freedom and constraint, often serving as metaphors for human existence or societal systems.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a bird in a cage
2. a river confined by its banks
3. a marionette controlled by strings
4. a train bound to its tracks

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a lighthouse
6. a compass
7. a clock
8. a bridge
9. a mirror
10. a key
11. a lock
12. a ladder
13. a map
14. a telescope
15. a sailboat
16. a parachute
17. a flag
18. a lantern
19. a wheel
20. a chain
21. a fence
22. a gate
23. a road
24. a window

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
