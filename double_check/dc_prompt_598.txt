Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Artifacts created by cultures that practice traditional whaling which depict or symbolize the whale hunt.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A Makah ceremonial drum painted with whaling scenes
2. An Inuit scrimshaw depicting hunters in umiaqs pursuing bowhead whales
3. A traditional Japanese netsuke carved with whaling motifs
4. A Faroese tapestry showing a grindadr√°p whale drive

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A Roman mosaic of fishing boats
6. An Inuit walrus tusk carving
7. A Pacific Northwest totem pole with an orca
8. A Polynesian fish hook necklace
9. A Viking ship's wooden figurehead
10. An ancient Greek amphora with dolphins
11. A modern whale watching poster
12. A Maori jade pendant of a whale tail
13. A sailor's maritime tattoo design
14. A scallop shell with etched sea scenes
15. A contemporary whale conservation mural
16. An Aboriginal rock painting of dugongs
17. A carved wooden ship's wheel
18. A maritime museum diorama
19. A traditional fishing net design
20. A coastal village painting
21. An ivory compass rose
22. A seal hunting scene painting
23. A traditional boat-building diagram
24. A carved coral sea creature

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
