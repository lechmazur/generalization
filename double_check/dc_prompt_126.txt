Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Cultural symbols or motifs that represent strength or protection and are prominently featured in traditional art, folklore, or national emblems.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The oak tree on the Welsh flag
2. The double-headed eagle in Albanian heraldry
3. The Celtic shield knot in Irish art
4. The thunder dragon on Bhutan's national flag

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A horseshoe
6. The peace symbol
7. A four-leaf clover
8. The yin-yang symbol
9. A dreamcatcher
10. The Olympic rings
11. A scarab beetle charm
12. The Star of David
13. A rabbit's foot
14. The ankh symbol
15. A heart shape
16. The infinity symbol
17. A cross pendant
18. The evil eye amulet
19. A pentagram
20. The caduceus
21. A lotus flower
22. The om symbol
23. A crescent moon
24. The tree of life

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
