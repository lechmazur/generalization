Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Public events that integrate live music with educational workshops on specific academic subjects

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A festival where attendees can enjoy live jazz performances while participating in workshops about the history of jazz music and its influence on American culture.
2. An event featuring live classical music concerts alongside interactive sessions on the physics of sound and acoustics.
3. A community gathering with live folk music and educational workshops on environmental science, focusing on sustainability and conservation.
4. A cultural fair that includes live performances of traditional music from various countries, coupled with workshops on world geography and cultural studies.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A concert with a guest speaker discussing the artist's career.
6. A music festival with food stalls offering cooking demonstrations.
7. An educational conference with background music during breaks.
8. A workshop on music theory without any live performances.
9. A science fair with a DJ playing music in the background.
10. A live music event with a silent auction for educational scholarships.
11. A history lecture series with live music as an opening act.
12. A music-themed party with trivia games about pop culture.
13. An art exhibition with live music performances but no educational component.
14. A workshop on environmental conservation with recorded music playing.
15. A cultural festival with traditional dances but no educational workshops.
16. A live music event with a book signing by a music historian.
17. A seminar on world cultures with a playlist of international music.
18. A music festival with a panel discussion on the music industry.
19. An educational event on physics with a live demonstration but no music.
20. A concert with a pre-show talk about the band's influences.
21. A workshop on sound engineering without live music performances.
22. A live music event with a charity component for education.
23. A cultural event with live music and a food tasting session.
24. An educational conference with a live band playing during the reception.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
