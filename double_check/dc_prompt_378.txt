Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer electronics devices that measure and display a user's galvanic skin response.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A device that tracks stress levels through skin conductivity and displays the data on a wristband.
2. A portable gadget that measures emotional arousal via skin response and shows results on an integrated screen.
3. An electronic tool worn on the finger that monitors skin conductance to gauge relaxation and displays it on a small LCD.
4. A handheld unit that assesses skin's electrical properties to indicate stress and features a digital readout.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A smartwatch that tracks heart rate and displays it on the screen.
6. A fitness tracker that monitors steps and shows them on a device.
7. A blood pressure monitor that displays readings on a digital screen.
8. A thermometer that measures body temperature and shows it on an LCD.
9. A sleep tracker that analyzes sleep patterns and displays data on a smartphone app.
10. A pulse oximeter that measures blood oxygen levels and shows them on a screen.
11. A glucose meter that displays blood sugar levels on a digital display.
12. A pedometer that counts steps and shows the total on an electronic screen.
13. A smartwatch that measures calories burned and displays the information.
14. A device that tracks hydration levels and displays them on a wristband.
15. A fitness band that monitors workout intensity and shows it on a screen.
16. A heart rate variability monitor that displays data on a mobile app.
17. A device that measures respiratory rate and shows it on a digital display.
18. A smartwatch that tracks sleep stages and displays them on the device.
19. A fitness tracker that monitors UV exposure and shows it on a screen.
20. A device that measures body fat percentage and displays it on an electronic screen.
21. A smartwatch that tracks daily activity and displays it on the device.
22. A device that monitors blood alcohol levels and shows them on a digital display.
23. A fitness tracker that measures altitude and displays it on a screen.
24. A smartwatch that tracks menstrual cycles and displays them on the device.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
