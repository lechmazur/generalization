Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technologies that incorporate biometric data for identity verification and are regulated by international standards

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ICAO-compliant electronic passport with facial recognition
2. ISO/IEC standardized fingerprint scanning ATM system
3. IEC-certified iris recognition border control gate
4. ISO-regulated voice authentication banking system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Apple Face ID
6. Google reCAPTCHA
7. Building security keycard
8. Smartphone fingerprint unlock
9. Digital signature pad
10. Password manager software
11. DNA testing kit
12. Employee time clock
13. Car key fob
14. Two-factor authentication app
15. Security camera system
16. Handwriting recognition software
17. Facial detection photo software
18. Heart rate monitor
19. Digital door lock
20. Police fingerprint database
21. Medical record system
22. Student ID card
23. Gym membership scanner
24. Social media facial tagging

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
