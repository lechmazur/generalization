Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or entities that combine elements of extreme rarity or historical significance with a functional or symbolic purpose, often associated with luxury or awe-inspiring qualities.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The Hope Diamond
2. The Crown of St. Edward
3. The Codex Leicester
4. The Faberg√© Eggs

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A rare stamp collection
6. An antique pocket watch
7. A vintage car
8. A limited edition designer handbag
9. A historic painting
10. A rare coin
11. An ancient artifact
12. A signed first edition book
13. A luxury yacht
14. A high-end sports car
15. A rare musical instrument
16. An exclusive piece of jewelry
17. A historic document
18. A rare species of plant
19. An original piece of art
20. A vintage wine bottle
21. A collector's edition action figure
22. A rare mineral specimen
23. An antique piece of furniture
24. A historic photograph

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
