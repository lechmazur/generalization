Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Woven textiles incorporating metallic threads that depict stylized, geometric floral patterns inspired by Persian Khorasan historical designs.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A shimmering tapestry with intricate, angular floral motifs woven with gold and silver threads.
2. A luxurious throw blanket featuring abstract, geometric flower designs in metallic copper and bronze threads.
3. An elegant wall hanging with stylized, diamond-shaped floral patterns crafted from shimmering platinum threads.
4. A decorative cushion cover adorned with bold, geometric floral designs woven with lustrous gold and silver threads.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A silk scarf with floral patterns in vibrant colors.
6. A woolen rug with traditional Persian designs.
7. A tapestry depicting realistic floral scenes without metallic threads.
8. A cotton bedspread with geometric patterns in pastel colors.
9. A linen tablecloth with embroidered floral motifs.
10. A velvet curtain with abstract designs in metallic threads but no floral patterns.
11. A brocade jacket with traditional Chinese floral designs.
12. A hand-woven basket with geometric patterns but no metallic threads.
13. A silk saree with intricate floral designs in metallic threads but not geometric.
14. A tapestry with animal motifs woven with metallic threads.
15. A decorative pillow with paisley patterns in metallic threads.
16. A wall hanging with geometric designs but no floral elements.
17. A woven mat with tribal patterns in natural fibers.
18. A tapestry depicting a landscape scene with metallic threads but no floral patterns.
19. A hand-knitted shawl with floral designs but no metallic threads.
20. A woven wall art piece with abstract designs in metallic threads but no floral elements.
21. A traditional Persian carpet with floral motifs but no metallic threads.
22. A decorative fabric with geometric patterns in metallic threads but no floral designs.
23. A woven textile with realistic floral patterns but no metallic threads.
24. A tapestry with geometric designs inspired by Native American art, woven with metallic threads but no floral patterns.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
