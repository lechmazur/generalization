Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Natural formations or artifacts that have been designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites due to their cultural or historical significance and are located in regions that were significantly impacted by the Iron Age.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Stonehenge
2. Göbekli Tepe
3. Rock-Hewn Churches of Lalibela
4. Ironbridge Gorge

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. the Great Wall of China
6. Machu Picchu
7. the Colosseum
8. the Pyramids of Giza
9. the Taj Mahal
10. the Acropolis of Athens
11. the Statue of Liberty
12. the Eiffel Tower
13. the Sydney Opera House
14. the Grand Canyon
15. the Great Barrier Reef
16. the Serengeti National Park
17. the Galápagos Islands
18. the Amazon Rainforest
19. the Palace of Versailles
20. the Historic Centre of Rome
21. the Alhambra
22. the Angkor Wat
23. the Petra
24. the Chichen Itza

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
