Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Individuals or entities known for excelling in a domain through unconventional methods or strategies that defy traditional expectations.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Guerrilla marketing campaigns that achieve viral success through unconventional tactics.
2. Artists who use non-traditional materials or methods to create groundbreaking works.
3. Entrepreneurs who disrupt industries by leveraging unique business models that defy conventional wisdom.
4. Athletes who achieve success by employing unorthodox training or competitive strategies.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Individuals who excel in their field through hard work and dedication.
6. Companies that achieve success by following industry best practices.
7. Innovators who create new technologies that revolutionize their industry.
8. Artists who master traditional techniques to create highly skilled works.
9. Athletes who win championships through superior physical conditioning and skill.
10. Entrepreneurs who build successful businesses by identifying and filling market gaps.
11. Scientists who make groundbreaking discoveries through rigorous research and experimentation.
12. Politicians who gain popularity by aligning with the values and beliefs of their constituents.
13. Chefs who create innovative dishes by combining traditional culinary techniques with modern ingredients.
14. Musicians who achieve fame by mastering their instruments and creating popular songs.
15. Authors who write best-selling novels by crafting compelling stories and characters.
16. Actors who win awards for their ability to portray a wide range of roles convincingly.
17. Architects who design iconic buildings by combining form and function in innovative ways.
18. Fashion designers who create trendsetting clothing lines by understanding and anticipating consumer preferences.
19. Photographers who capture stunning images by mastering the technical aspects of their craft.
20. Teachers who inspire their students to learn and grow by creating engaging lesson plans and fostering a positive classroom environment.
21. Doctors who save lives by staying up-to-date with the latest medical research and treatments.
22. Engineers who design and build complex systems by applying their knowledge of mathematics and physics.
23. Lawyers who win cases by presenting compelling arguments and evidence in court.
24. Journalists who uncover important stories by conducting thorough investigations and interviews.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
