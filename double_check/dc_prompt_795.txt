Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Musical instruments invented in the 20th century that utilize electronic components to produce sound

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Theremin
2. Ondes Martenot
3. Mellotron
4. Telharmonium

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Piano
6. Electric guitar
7. Violin
8. Synthesizer keyboard
9. Drum machine
10. Accordion
11. Saxophone
12. Electronic drum pad
13. Bass guitar
14. Hammond organ
15. Clarinet
16. Digital piano
17. Xylophone
18. MIDI controller
19. Flute
20. Electronic keyboard
21. Trombone
22. Amplified harmonica
23. Timpani
24. Electric bass

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
