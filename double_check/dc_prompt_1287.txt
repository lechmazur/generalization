Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or systems that utilize hierarchical structures to organize or distribute resources, information, or energy, where the hierarchy is emergent rather than explicitly designed.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a forest ecosystem
2. a corporate organizational chart
3. a neural network in machine learning
4. a food web in an ocean

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a library catalog
6. a family tree
7. a subway map
8. a computer file system
9. a supply chain network
10. a social media network
11. a traffic light system
12. a school grading system
13. a periodic table of elements
14. a recipe book
15. a city zoning map
16. a sports league ranking
17. a music playlist
18. a calendar schedule
19. a voting ballot
20. a shopping mall directory
21. a dictionary
22. a weather forecast model
23. a board game rulebook
24. a museum exhibit layout

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
