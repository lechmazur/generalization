Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional performing arts that incorporate both vocal storytelling and instrumental accompaniment, where the narrative is delivered through a combination of sung and spoken elements, often with a focus on historical or cultural themes.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Pansori
2. Khyal
3. Nanguan
4. Griot performance

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Ballet performance
6. Symphony orchestra concert
7. Solo flute recital
8. Poetry reading
9. Stand-up comedy
10. Modern dance performance
11. Puppet theater
12. Silent film screening with live music
13. Drum circle
14. A cappella singing
15. Street busking
16. Musical theater
17. Jazz improvisation
18. Chamber music concert
19. Rock concert
20. Folk song performance
21. Mime show
22. Gospel choir
23. Spoken word poetry
24. Classical Indian dance

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
