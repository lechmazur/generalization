Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural practices that have been adapted into modern automated systems for efficiency

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Automated tea ceremonies using robotic arms to perform traditional movements
2. Digital platforms for arranging traditional matchmaking services
3. AI-powered systems for creating traditional calligraphy art
4. Automated looms that weave traditional patterns into modern textiles

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Modern software for managing traditional farming techniques
6. Apps that teach traditional dance forms
7. Virtual reality experiences of historical cultural events
8. Online courses on traditional cooking methods
9. Digital archives of traditional music
10. Augmented reality for exploring ancient ruins
11. Smartphones with apps for traditional language learning
12. Robots used in traditional manufacturing processes
13. Automated systems for tracking traditional festival dates
14. Software for simulating traditional architectural designs
15. AI tools for analyzing traditional literature
16. Digital tools for preserving traditional oral histories
17. Automated systems for managing traditional agricultural cycles
18. Apps that simulate traditional board games
19. Robotic systems for traditional pottery making
20. AI for predicting traditional weather patterns
21. Virtual platforms for traditional storytelling
22. Automated systems for traditional financial transactions
23. Digital tools for traditional navigation methods
24. Software for managing traditional community events

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
