Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects that have been transformed from their original purpose to serve as a secure storage for valuable items

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a hollowed-out book used to hide jewelry
2. a repurposed coffee can storing cash
3. a false-bottomed drawer concealing important documents
4. a modified teddy bear with a hidden compartment for valuables

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a safe
6. a lockbox
7. a jewelry box
8. a piggy bank
9. a treasure chest
10. a vault
11. a briefcase
12. a suitcase
13. a backpack
14. a wallet
15. a coin purse
16. a filing cabinet
17. a storage bin
18. a locker
19. a drawer
20. a closet
21. a shelf
22. a toolbox
23. a medicine cabinet
24. a shoe box

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
