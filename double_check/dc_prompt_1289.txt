Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): cultural practices involving the creation of temporary, intricate designs using natural materials, often for ceremonial or decorative purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a mandala made from colored sand during a Tibetan Buddhist ceremony
2. a rangoli design created with rice flour and flower petals for Diwali celebrations
3. a henna tattoo applied to hands and feet for a wedding ceremony
4. a flower carpet laid out for a religious procession in Belgium

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a permanent mural painted on a city wall
6. a sculpture carved from marble
7. a woven tapestry displayed in a museum
8. a stained glass window in a cathedral
9. a graffiti tag sprayed on a train
10. a pottery vase decorated with intricate patterns
11. a quilt sewn with traditional motifs
12. a tattoo inked permanently on skin
13. a mosaic made of tiles on a floor
14. a carved wooden mask used in rituals
15. a painted canvas displayed in an art gallery
16. a metal sculpture in a public park
17. a calligraphy scroll framed on a wall
18. a beaded necklace worn as jewelry
19. a carved stone monument in a cemetery
20. a printed fabric used for clothing
21. a ceramic plate with painted designs
22. a carved ivory figurine
23. a painted Easter egg
24. a carved pumpkin for Halloween

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
