Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures designed for human habitation that can be expanded or reconfigured using standardized, detachable modules

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Kasita smart home units
2. B1M4 modular apartment complex
3. Honomobo shipping container homes
4. Connect Homes prefab system

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Empire State Building
6. log cabin
7. igloo
8. tree house
9. yurt
10. storage shed
11. greenhouse
12. mobile home
13. lighthouse
14. barn
15. office cubicle
16. garden gazebo
17. camping tent
18. windmill
19. grain silo
20. parking garage
21. fire lookout tower
22. Victorian mansion
23. adobe dwelling
24. castle tower

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
