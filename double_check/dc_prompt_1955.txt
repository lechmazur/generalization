Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Structures built using recycled glass bottles as primary construction material.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A small garden shed built with glass bottles mortared together.
2. A decorative wall incorporating embedded glass bottles of different colors.
3. A house with walls made of glass bottles filled with sand and bound with cement.
4. A bench constructed with stacked glass bottles and a concrete top.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A house made of adobe bricks.
6. A sculpture made of recycled plastic.
7. A road paved with recycled tires.
8. A building with solar panels.
9. A bridge made of steel and concrete.
10. A chair made of bamboo.
11. A table made of reclaimed wood.
12. A fence made of recycled plastic lumber.
13. A building insulated with recycled newspaper.
14. A countertop made of recycled glass shards.
15. A floor tiled with broken ceramic pieces.
16. A stained glass window.
17. A bottle of wine.
18. A glass jar.
19. A glass vase.
20. A building with glass windows.
21. A greenhouse made of glass panes.
22. A mosaic made of broken glass.
23. A piece of jewelry with embedded glass beads.
24. A recycled glass bottle used as a drinking glass.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
