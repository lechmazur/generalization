Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or concepts that combine opposing attributes in their names or descriptions

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. bittersweet chocolate
2. jumbo shrimp
3. deafening silence
4. living dead

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. black and white
6. yin and yang
7. salt and pepper
8. day and night
9. sweet and sour
10. good versus evil
11. heaven and hell
12. positive and negative
13. light and dark
14. fire and ice
15. sun and moon
16. war and peace
17. life and death
18. past and future
19. truth and lies
20. love and hate
21. success and failure
22. pleasure and pain
23. victory and defeat
24. right and wrong

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
