Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Architect-designed structures built as responses to natural disasters

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Floating School in Makoko, Nigeria
2. Tsunami Memorial Park in Thailand
3. Hurricane-Resilient Homes in New Orleans
4. Earthquake-Resistant Community Center in Nepal

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Eiffel Tower in Paris
6. Burj Khalifa in Dubai
7. Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco
8. Sydney Opera House in Australia
9. Colosseum in Rome
10. Empire State Building in New York
11. Great Wall of China
12. Taj Mahal in India
13. Machu Picchu in Peru
14. Petronas Towers in Malaysia
15. Big Ben in London
16. Statue of Liberty in New York
17. Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy
18. Christ the Redeemer in Brazil
19. Hagia Sophia in Turkey
20. Louvre Museum in Paris
21. Neuschwanstein Castle in Germany
22. Angkor Wat in Cambodia
23. Mount Rushmore in the USA
24. Stonehenge in England

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
