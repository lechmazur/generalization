Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Consumer products marketed primarily towards unmarried Chinese women between the ages of 25 and 35 living in Tier 1 cities in 2023

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a luxury handbag with a minimalist design
2. a subscription box for premium skincare products
3. a high-end electric scooter in pastel colors
4. a smart jewelry piece that tracks fitness metrics

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a children's toy set
6. a men's grooming kit
7. a family-sized SUV
8. a retirement savings plan
9. a baby stroller
10. a college textbook
11. a wedding dress
12. a home gardening toolset
13. a pet food subscription
14. a gaming console
15. a men's business suit
16. a children's educational app
17. a retirement community brochure
18. a family vacation package
19. a toddler's car seat
20. a high school yearbook
21. a men's cologne
22. a baby formula product
23. a home security system
24. a college dorm room decor kit

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
