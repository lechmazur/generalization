Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Technological innovations that were initially dismissed but later became essential in warfare

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The use of radar technology in military operations
2. The implementation of drones for surveillance and combat
3. The adoption of stealth technology in aircraft design
4. The integration of GPS for navigation and targeting in military applications

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. The development of the internet for global communication
6. The invention of the steam engine for industrial use
7. The creation of the printing press for mass dissemination of information
8. The discovery of penicillin for medical treatment
9. The use of nuclear power for energy generation
10. The introduction of the assembly line for manufacturing efficiency
11. The application of artificial intelligence in consumer products
12. The deployment of satellites for weather forecasting
13. The utilization of solar panels for renewable energy
14. The advancement of robotics in industrial automation
15. The emergence of virtual reality for entertainment purposes
16. The rise of electric vehicles for sustainable transportation
17. The growth of mobile phones for personal communication
18. The expansion of e-commerce for online shopping
19. The development of 3D printing for prototyping and production
20. The innovation of blockchain technology for secure transactions
21. The evolution of social media for networking and information sharing
22. The progress of gene editing for medical research
23. The implementation of smart home devices for home automation
24. The advancement of wearable technology for health monitoring

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
