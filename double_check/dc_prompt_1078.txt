Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): luxury experiences or products that incorporate celestial or astronomical motifs in their design or branding

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A luxury watch with a starry night sky dial
2. A high-end perfume inspired by the phases of the moon
3. A designer handbag with a constellation pattern
4. A premium champagne brand with a celestial-themed label

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A luxury car with a sleek design
6. A high-end fashion brand known for its minimalist style
7. A gourmet chocolate brand with exotic flavors
8. A designer dress with floral patterns
9. A luxury yacht with a modern interior
10. A premium skincare line using natural ingredients
11. A high-end hotel with an ocean view
12. A luxury pen with a gold finish
13. A designer shoe collection with vibrant colors
14. A gourmet coffee brand with a rich aroma
15. A luxury fragrance inspired by a tropical island
16. A high-end jewelry line with geometric shapes
17. A premium whiskey with a smoky flavor
18. A designer scarf with abstract art prints
19. A luxury spa offering holistic treatments
20. A high-end furniture line with a rustic look
21. A premium tea brand with rare blends
22. A designer sunglasses collection with bold frames
23. A luxury cruise with exotic destinations
24. A high-end bicycle with a lightweight frame

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
