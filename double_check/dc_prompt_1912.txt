Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Decorative items featuring animal-inspired motifs made from semi-precious stones

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A malachite frog figurine with emerald eyes
2. A carved lapis lazuli elephant pendant with ruby accents
3. A rose quartz butterfly brooch inlaid with tiny diamonds
4. An amethyst owl sculpture perched on a jasper branch

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A ceramic cat statue
6. A wooden horse carving
7. A gold lion pendant
8. A silver dolphin bracelet
9. A glass hummingbird figurine
10. A plastic turtle keychain
11. A diamond ring
12. A pearl necklace
13. An emerald earrings
14. A ruby pendant
15. A sapphire bracelet
16. A painting of a tiger
17. A photograph of a bird
18. A drawing of a fish
19. A stuffed animal bear
20. A taxidermied deer head
21. A fossil of a dinosaur
22. A seashell collection
23. A feather pen
24. An insect preserved in amber

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
