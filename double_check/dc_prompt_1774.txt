Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional dances performed with masks representing mythological creatures

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Barong dance from Bali, Indonesia
2. Tsukumogami dance from Japan
3. Pulikali dance from Kerala, India
4. Tlakoleros dance from Mexico

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Folk dance with traditional costumes
6. Ceremonial dance performed during religious festivals
7. Dance drama depicting historical events
8. Traditional dance with elaborate headdresses
9. Indigenous dance using animal skins
10. Ritual dance to invoke rain
11. War dance performed by warriors
12. Dance with painted faces representing spirits
13. Traditional dance with symbolic gestures
14. Cultural dance performed at weddings
15. Dance with masks representing historical figures
16. Performance art using modern masks
17. Dance with masks depicting animals
18. Traditional dance with face paint
19. Dance drama with mythological themes
20. Street dance with masks
21. Traditional dance with props
22. Dance with masks representing emotions
23. Ceremonial dance with symbolic masks
24. Traditional dance with masks representing deities

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
