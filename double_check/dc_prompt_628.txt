Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Figurines or statues of historical figures where the figure is depicted holding a book and the title of the book is clearly visible and legible.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. A resin statue of Frederick Douglass holding a copy of his autobiography, "Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave."
2. A bronze figurine of Abraham Lincoln with a miniature replica of the Bible in his hands.
3. A porcelain statuette of Marie Curie holding a textbook titled "Traité de Physique Élémentaire."
4. A wooden carving of William Shakespeare holding a copy of his play "Hamlet."

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. A bust of Socrates.
6. A painting of Queen Elizabeth I.
7. A photograph of Albert Einstein.
8. A figurine of Joan of Arc with a sword.
9. A statue of Nelson Mandela with his fist raised.
10. A miniature replica of the Rosetta Stone.
11. A model of the Eiffel Tower.
12. A statue of a Roman soldier.
13. A figurine of a ballet dancer.
14. A bust of Winston Churchill with a cigar.
15. A statue of Leonardo da Vinci holding a paintbrush.
16. A figurine of Mozart playing the piano.
17. A statue of Amelia Earhart with a pilot's helmet.
18. A figurine of a generic scholar reading a scroll.
19. A statue of a medieval monk holding a bible, the title not visible.
20. A painting of a library.
21. A photograph of a historical manuscript.
22. A model of a printing press.
23. A statue of Benjamin Franklin with a kite.
24. A figurine of Rosa Parks sitting on a bus.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
