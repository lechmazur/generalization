Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Locations where royal artifacts were temporarily hidden during World War II to protect them from bombing or looting

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. Manod Quarry in Wales where National Gallery paintings were stored
2. Mentmore Towers where British Museum treasures were kept
3. Coombe Abbey where Crown Jewels were secured
4. Fort Breendonk where Belgian royal collections were hidden

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. Tower of London Crown Jewel House
6. Vatican Secret Archives
7. Louvre Museum basement
8. British Museum storage facility
9. Windsor Castle dungeons
10. Bank of England vaults
11. Edinburgh Castle vault
12. Versailles Palace underground chambers
13. Buckingham Palace wine cellars
14. Hampton Court Palace secret rooms
15. Westminster Abbey crypt
16. Royal Ontario Museum storage
17. Smithsonian Institution archives
18. Metropolitan Museum warehouse
19. Hermitage Museum vault
20. Topkapi Palace treasury
21. Dresden Green Vault
22. Imperial Treasury Vienna
23. Royal Armory Madrid
24. Crown Jewels of Ireland vault

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
