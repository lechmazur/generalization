Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects designed to evoke emotional responses through minimalistic design and monochromatic color schemes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a black-and-white photograph of a lone tree in a foggy landscape
2. a sleek, matte black vase with a single white flower
3. a minimalist poster featuring a single tear drop in grayscale
4. a monochromatic sculpture of a human figure with exaggerated, abstract features

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a brightly colored abstract painting with chaotic brushstrokes
6. a rainbow-colored mosaic tile wall
7. a detailed, multicolored tapestry depicting a historical scene
8. a vibrant, patterned quilt with intricate stitching
9. a neon sign displaying a cheerful message
10. a colorful children's toy with multiple interactive features
11. a richly decorated, gold-gilded picture frame
12. a detailed, colorful mural of a bustling cityscape
13. a brightly lit, multicolored LED installation
14. a patterned, floral-printed dress with bold colors
15. a detailed, colorful stained glass window
16. a vibrant, multicolored abstract sculpture
17. a brightly painted, whimsical garden gnome
18. a colorful, patterned ceramic bowl
19. a detailed, multicolored illustration of a fantasy creature
20. a brightly colored, patterned rug with intricate designs
21. a vibrant, multicolored graffiti wall
22. a detailed, colorful diorama of a natural landscape
23. a brightly lit, multicolored fireworks display
24. a colorful, patterned mosaic tabletop

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
