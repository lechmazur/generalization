Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Circular safety devices that float and are designed to be thrown to people in distress

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ring buoy
2. life preserver
3. rescue tube
4. life ring

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. life jacket
6. pool noodle
7. inflatable raft
8. swim fins
9. rescue board
10. flotation cushion
11. water wings
12. rescue can
13. life boat
14. swim belt
15. rescue rope
16. inflatable arm bands
17. rescue hook
18. life raft
19. rescue pole
20. rescue sling
21. rescue float
22. life line
23. rescue harness
24. rescue torpedo

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
