Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Traditional cultural practices that incorporate the use of reflective materials for ceremonial or artistic purposes

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. The use of mirrored tiles in the construction of a traditional Indian rangoli design during Diwali celebrations.
2. The incorporation of polished metal surfaces in the ceremonial masks used by the Dogon people of Mali during the Dama dance.
3. The application of reflective glass beads in the creation of traditional Ojibwe floral beadwork patterns for ceremonial garments.
4. The use of shiny, lacquered surfaces on traditional Japanese hagoita paddles displayed during the New Year's festival.

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:

6. The incorporation of feathers in the headdresses worn by participants in the Brazilian Carnival.
7. The use of intricate embroidery on traditional Chinese qipao dresses for special occasions.

10. The incorporation of seashells in the creation of traditional Hawaiian leis for welcoming ceremonies.
11. The use of silk fabrics in the making of traditional Korean hanbok worn during Seollal celebrations.
12. The application of gold leaf in the decoration of traditional Thai temple murals.
13. The use of clay in the creation of traditional Hopi pottery for ceremonial purposes.

23. The use of woven grass in the construction of traditional Samoan fale houses for community gatherings.
24. The application of ochre paint in the body art of traditional Australian Aboriginal rituals.

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
