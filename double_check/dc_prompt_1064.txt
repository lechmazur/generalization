Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Objects or phenomena that exhibit elasticity or flexibility in their structure or behavior, allowing them to adapt to external forces or conditions without permanent deformation.

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. a rubber band
2. a trampoline
3. a bungee cord
4. a yoga mat

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. a brick
6. a glass bottle
7. a steel beam
8. a wooden chair
9. a ceramic vase
10. a concrete wall
11. a marble statue
12. a diamond ring
13. a granite countertop
14. a plastic spoon
15. a metal fork
16. a stone sculpture
17. a porcelain plate
18. a copper pipe
19. a lead weight
20. a gold bar
21. a silver coin
22. a wooden table
23. a glass window
24. a ceramic tile

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
