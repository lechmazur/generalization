Theme, rule, criterion, or category (referred to as "theme"): Gemstones that naturally occur in two distinct color zones divided by a straight line

Here are four examples intended to follow this theme:
1. ametrine
2. watermelon tourmaline
3. bicolor sapphire
4. bicolor topaz

Your first task is to evaluate the examples above on a scale of scores 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they align with the theme and whether they don't too obviously reveal the theme. For each example, output its number in tags <number></number> and its score as an integer in tags <score></score>. For example:

<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>

Here are anti-examples intended to follow a broader category but not the specific theme:
5. opal
6. tiger's eye
7. labradorite
8. moonstone
9. alexandrite
10. color change garnet
11. rainbow obsidian
12. agate
13. malachite
14. charoite
15. fluorite
16. ammolite
17. sunstone
18. fire agate
19. mystic topaz
20. rutilated quartz
21. moss agate
22. azurite
23. jasper
24. spectrolite

Your second task is to evaluate candidates listed above. This time, the candidates are "anti-examples" that not meant to exemplify the specific theme but rather a theme that is more general or similar. They could be misleading the user into confusion. Anti-examples could be examples of things connected, linked, or associated to the specific theme BUT NOT examples of this specific theme (unlike earlier). Evaluate them on a scale of 0 (least), 1, 2, 3... to 10 (most) based on how well they represent this specification of not matching the specific theme but matching something broader or connected. Use the same format as before. Example:

<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
...
<number>24</number><score>3</score>

Do not output anything else.
