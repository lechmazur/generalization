Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A bustling street market filled with vendors selling traditional foods and crafts, where the sounds and smells evoke a sense of cultural heritage.
A serene garden with carefully placed sculptures and water features, designed to inspire contemplation and reflection on nature and spirituality.
A modern art gallery with minimalist decor and strategic lighting, where the ambiance enhances the viewer's engagement with the displayed works.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A traditional church with stained glass windows and pews.
A historic castle with stone walls and ancient artifacts.
A tranquil spa with soothing music and scented candles.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.
