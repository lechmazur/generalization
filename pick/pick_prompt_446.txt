Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A tool used by birdwatchers to bring distant birds into closer view.
An instrument that allows for the magnification of small objects for detailed study.
A device used by astronomers to observe distant celestial bodies.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A monocular used for hunting to spot game.
A periscope used to see over obstacles.
A spyglass used historically for maritime exploration.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A camera used to capture images from a distance.
2. A heads-up display in aircraft for pilot assistance.
3. A night vision device that enhances visibility in low light.
4. A thermal imaging camera used for detecting heat signatures.
5. A digital screen that displays enlarged images.
6. A pair of binoculars used for marine navigation.
7. A drone equipped with a camera for aerial photography.
8. An apparatus used in theaters to enhance the audience's view of the stage. <<LEFTOVER>>
