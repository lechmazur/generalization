Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The school in "Harry Potter" inspired by various British boarding schools like Eton College
The prison in "The Count of Monte Cristo" inspired by the Ch√¢teau d'If
The monastery in "The Name of the Rose" inspired by several medieval monasteries

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A castle in a medieval romance
A mythical kingdom in a fantasy epic
A laboratory in a science fiction horror

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

1. A courtroom in a legal drama
2. A magical forest in a fairy tale
3. A futuristic cityscape in a science fiction novel
4. A space station in a sci-fi thriller
5. A haunted house in a gothic novel
6. A dystopian society in a speculative fiction work
7. The asylum in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" inspired by the Oregon State Hospital <<LEFTOVER>>
