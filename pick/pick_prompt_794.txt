Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Microwave ovens were an accidental discovery during radar-related research for the military.
The technology behind the internet was initially developed by the U.S. Department of Defense.
The development of duct tape was spurred by the needs of the U.S. military during World War II.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
Technologies developed for medical purposes that found applications in other fields.
Technological advancements that were initially developed for industrial use and later adapted for home use.
Technologies that were created for telecommunications and later adapted for other uses.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. Technologies that were developed for the maritime industry and later found applications in other fields.
2. Technologies developed for educational purposes that found applications in the entertainment industry.
3. Inventions that were created for space exploration and later used in everyday life.
4. Innovations that were initially developed for the energy sector and later used in consumer products.
5. Innovations that were initially developed for the transportation industry and later used in consumer products.
6. Technologies developed for the entertainment industry that found applications in education.
7. Products that were created for the aviation industry and later adapted for other uses.
8. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology was originally developed for military navigation. <<LEFTOVER>>
