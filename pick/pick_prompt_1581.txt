Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The journey of a soul through the afterlife as depicted in ancient Egyptian mythology, navigating through various trials and judgments before reaching the final weighing of the heart.
The process of becoming a member of a secret society, involving multiple stages of initiation, each shrouded in mystery and requiring the demonstration of loyalty and knowledge.
The bureaucratic process of obtaining a rare and ancient artifact from a government archive, involving numerous intimidating interviews and document verifications, all conducted in a manner that evokes a sense of timeless authority.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony in a tribal culture.
A religious conversion process involving study and rituals.
A traditional wedding ceremony with multiple rituals and steps.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.
