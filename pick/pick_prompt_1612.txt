Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The construction of the Hoover Dam, which required advancements in concrete strength testing and structural analysis.
The Manhattan Project, which required the invention of new statistical methods for nuclear reaction modeling and material analysis.
The design of the Golden Gate Bridge, which involved innovations in aerodynamic modeling and suspension cable tension calculations.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
The creation of the first nuclear reactors.
The construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.
The construction of the Channel Tunnel.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. The creation of the first electric power grid.
2. The invention of the first computers.
3. The construction of the Eiffel Tower.
4. The building of the Transcontinental Railroad.
5. The construction of the London Underground.
6. The development of the first space rockets.
7. The design of the first skyscrapers.
8. The development of the Panama Canal, which necessitated new methods for calculating water flow and soil stability. <<LEFTOVER>>
