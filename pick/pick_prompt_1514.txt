Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Some types of squid that change colors and create light patterns as they swim
Certain comb jellies that refract light into rainbow patterns as they move
Some species of deep-sea fish that have bioluminescent organs creating shifting light patterns

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
Laser light shows that project moving patterns of color
Light shows at concerts that create dynamic patterns of color
Fireworks that create colorful, moving patterns in the night sky

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. LED screens that display changing patterns of light and color
2. Certain species of jellyfish that display iridescent colors when they move through the water <<LEFTOVER>>
3. Holographic stickers that change appearance with angle of view
4. Kaleidoscopes that create shifting patterns of color when turned
5. Oil slicks on water that create shifting patterns of color
6. Auroras that display shifting patterns of light in the sky
7. Prism glasses that split light into colorful patterns
8. Soap bubbles that create rainbow patterns when they move
