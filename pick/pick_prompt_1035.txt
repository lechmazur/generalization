Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
An ancient library buried beneath a city, its texts lost to time.
A derelict museum with exhibits scattered and unrecognizable.
An abandoned archive building, its documents decayed and unreadable.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A historical monument still visited by tourists.
A well-preserved ancient temple with guided tours.
A national archive with digitized records.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A bustling city library with community programs.
2. A forgotten observatory overtaken by forest, its instruments rusted and broken. <<LEFTOVER>>
3. A cultural heritage site with active conservation efforts.
4. A modern library with a digital catalog.
5. A renovated castle turned into a museum.
6. A historical library with a preservation program.
7. A well-maintained war memorial.
8. A famous archaeological site with ongoing excavations.
