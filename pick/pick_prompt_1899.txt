Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Analog control panels from the 1960s in power generation stations
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) from the 1980s used in manufacturing plants
SCADA systems installed in the 1970s for water treatment facilities

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
5G-enabled industrial communication systems
Cybersecurity software for industrial networks
Cloud-based industrial automation platforms

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. Robotic assembly lines introduced in the 2000s
2. Real-time data analytics platforms for factories
3. Digital twin technology for industrial simulations
4. Machine learning algorithms for quality control
5. Advanced robotics used in automotive manufacturing
6. AI-driven predictive maintenance systems
7. Edge computing devices for process optimization
8. Early distributed control systems (DCS) from the 1980s in oil refineries <<LEFTOVER>>
