Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A decorative art piece composed of a repeating pattern of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron is connected to at least three others, forming an aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound design.
A geometric sculpture made from a repeating pattern of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron shares at least three faces with others, forming a complex three-dimensional lattice.
An architectural model constructed from a series of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron is connected to at least three others, creating a stable and intricate structure.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A molecular model of water, showing the tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
A molecular model of methane, showing the tetrahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms around a carbon atom.
A molecular model of a diamond, showing the tetrahedral arrangement of carbon atoms.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A Lego structure built from interlocking plastic bricks.
2. A honeycomb structure composed of hexagonal cells.
3. A geodesic dome constructed from triangular panels.
4. A modular shelving unit made from interlocking components.
5. A modular building system using interlocking blocks.
6. A mathematical model demonstrating the properties of space-filling using a pattern of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron shares at least three faces with adjacent tetrahedra. <<LEFTOVER>>
7. A tessellation pattern on a flat surface using interlocking shapes.
8. A crystal lattice structure where atoms are arranged in a repeating pattern.
