Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The Didgeridoo, a traditional wind instrument developed by Indigenous Australians, which has gained worldwide recognition and use in various music genres.
The Polynesian outrigger canoe, a design that has significantly influenced modern sailing and boat-building techniques around the world.
The Maori Haka, a traditional war dance from New Zealand, which has been adopted and recognized globally in sports and cultural performances.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
The printing press, an innovation that transformed the spread of knowledge and literacy.
The compass, an essential tool for navigation that has influenced global exploration and trade.
The steam engine, a key development in the Industrial Revolution that powered machinery and transportation.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.
