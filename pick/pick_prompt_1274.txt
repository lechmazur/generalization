Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A novel that weaves together multiple character arcs into a single, overarching story with a recurring motif of seasons.
A video game with branching storylines that converge at key moments, creating a recursive narrative structure.
A podcast series where each episode explores a different character's perspective, all tied together by a central event that loops back to the beginning.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A single-episode TV show with no recurring themes or characters.
A collection of unrelated poems in an anthology.
A standalone short story with no connections to other narratives.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A collection of unrelated quotes in a book.
2. A recipe book with no overarching theme or connection between recipes.
3. A single act of a play with no connection to the rest of the performance.
4. A film anthology where each segment is connected by a shared object that reappears in cyclical fashion. <<LEFTOVER>>
5. A single scene from a movie with no context or connection to the plot.
6. A standalone comic strip with no recurring characters or storylines.
7. A list of random facts with no unifying theme.
8. A single song with no ties to an album or larger musical project.
