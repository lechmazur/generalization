Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Adaptive traffic management systems that use sensors and modular signal controllers to dynamically adjust traffic flow based on real-time conditions.
Modular water purification systems that can be reconfigured with different filtration units to adapt to varying water quality conditions in different environments.
Agricultural irrigation systems that use interchangeable sprinkler heads and sensors to adjust water distribution based on soil moisture levels and weather conditions.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A traditional power grid with fixed infrastructure.
A static traffic light system with predetermined timings.
A fixed-configuration water treatment plant.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A standard HVAC system without smart controls.
2. A non-modular solar panel installation.
3. A non-adaptive lighting system in a building.
4. A traditional telephone network with fixed lines.
5. A fixed-layout factory assembly line.
6. A fixed-configuration data center.
7. A non-adjustable irrigation system for a golf course.
8. Smart grid systems that employ modular energy storage units and distribution components to optimize electricity distribution in response to fluctuating demand and supply. <<LEFTOVER>>
