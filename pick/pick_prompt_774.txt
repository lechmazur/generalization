Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Magnetorheological fluids that modify their viscosity in response to magnetic fields
Self-healing polymers that restructure their molecular bonds when damaged
Photonic crystals that alter their optical properties through structural changes induced by light

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
Smart fabrics that change color based on environmental conditions
Thermostats that adjust temperature settings based on room conditions
Traffic systems that change light timings based on traffic flow

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. Smart lighting systems that adjust brightness based on ambient light
2. Smart grids that balance electricity distribution based on demand
3. Climate control systems that adjust based on external weather
4. Robots that modify their actions based on sensor input
5. Smartphones that adapt their interface based on user behavior
6. Shape-memory alloys that change their configuration in response to temperature changes <<LEFTOVER>>
7. Autonomous vehicles that alter routes based on traffic conditions
8. Home security systems that change alert levels based on detected activity
