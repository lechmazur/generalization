Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A medical imaging system that keeps minor fluctuations in signal intensity to reflect biological variability
A vinyl record digitization tool that intentionally retains some surface noise to mimic the original listening experience
Audio processing software that applies dithering to maintain the warmth of analog recordings during digital conversion

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A software that converts analog video to digital format without any intentional imperfections
A digital audio workstation that removes all background noise from recordings
A smartphone app that converts voice recordings into text

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A digital audio interface that converts analog audio signals into digital audio files
2. A digital signal processor that filters out all unwanted frequencies from an audio signal
3. A software that converts analog drawings into digital vector graphics
4. A software that converts handwritten notes into digital text
5. A system that converts analog sensor data into digital data for analysis
6. A digital converter that transforms analog radio signals into digital signals
7. A digital converter that transforms analog TV signals into digital signals for modern televisions
8. A digital camera that uses film grain emulation to preserve the aesthetic of traditional photography <<LEFTOVER>>
