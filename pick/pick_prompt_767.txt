Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The assembly line used by Henry Ford for the Model T automobile
The interchangeable parts system developed by Eli Whitney for muskets
The mechanized spinning jenny for textile production

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
3D printing technology in prototyping
The use of robotics in modern car manufacturing
Additive manufacturing in aerospace

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. Use of artificial intelligence in predictive maintenance
2. Lean manufacturing principles
3. Use of IoT in monitoring production lines
4. The use of CNC machines in precision manufacturing
5. Automation in packaging lines
6. Just-in-time manufacturing systems
7. The development of smart factories
8. The Bessemer process for mass production of steel <<LEFTOVER>>
