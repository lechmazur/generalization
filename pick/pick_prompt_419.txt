Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
An instrument that shows a series of images as a lever is moved.
A tool that reveals a sequence of numbers when a dial is turned.
A device that displays a new word or phrase each time a button is pressed.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A smartphone app that scrolls through information.
A book with pages that turn to reveal new content.
A deck of cards used for a magic trick.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A remote control that changes TV channels.
2. A gadget that uncovers a set of symbols with each twist of a knob. <<LEFTOVER>>
3. A music player that shuffles through songs.
4. A game controller that navigates through menus.
5. A fitness tracker that displays different metrics.
6. A digital watch that shows time in different formats.
7. A calculator that performs sequential operations.
8. A camera that cycles through different photo filters.
