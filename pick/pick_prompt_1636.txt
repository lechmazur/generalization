Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The fractal-like distribution of phytoplankton blooms in coastal saline waters
The complex network of tidal channels in salt marshes
The formation of salt crystals on the surface of hypersaline lagoons

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
The fractal patterns of river deltas
The branching patterns of river systems
The branching patterns of lightning in the sky

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. The fractal patterns in coral reefs
2. The intricate branching patterns of mangrove roots in estuarine environments <<LEFTOVER>>
3. The fractal patterns in clouds
4. The self-similar patterns in coastlines
5. The branching patterns of trees in a forest
6. The fractal patterns in the structure of sponges
7. The fractal geometry of snowflakes
8. The fractal patterns in the structure of crystals
