Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae forming slugs
Quorum sensing in Vibrio fischeri leading to bioluminescence
Myxobacteria aggregating into fruiting bodies

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
Bacteria moving towards a food source
Ants foraging in trails
Spermatozoa swimming towards an egg

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A school of krill migrating
2. Fish schooling
3. Birds flocking
4. Slime mold growing on a decaying log
5. Neutrophils migrating towards a site of infection <<LEFTOVER>>
6. A flock of sheep moving across a field
7. Cancer cells metastasizing
8. Paramecia moving towards a light source
