Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The Watergate scandal, involving President Nixon, highlighted the concept of utilitarianism, where the perceived greater good (national security) was used to justify illegal actions (political espionage).
The impeachment trial of President Clinton centered on perjury and obstruction of justice, raising questions about the nature of truth, morality, and the rule of law in a democratic society.
The Iran-Contra affair during the Reagan administration raised issues of executive power and the limits of presidential authority, sparking debate about the balance of powers and the nature of republicanism.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
Foreign interference in elections
Influence peddling by lobbyists
Abuse of power by law enforcement agencies

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.
