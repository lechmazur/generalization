Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Vintage woven hamper with a dedicated compartment for wine bottles
Early 20th-century wicker basket designed with insulated sections for champagne
1930s wicker picnic set with a built-in rack for holding soda bottles

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
Contemporary wicker hamper without specific beverage compartments
Wooden picnic box with utensils but no beverage storage
Plastic picnic basket with a section for snacks

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.
