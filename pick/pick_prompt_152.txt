Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
In the city of Equinox, every citizen, upon reaching maturity, begins a cycle through all recognized professions, from sanitation worker to Supreme Judge, spending a year in each role regardless of aptitude or preference.
Within the underwater city of Aquatica, citizens are genetically modified to adapt to different roles. Every five years, a hormonal shift triggers a metamorphosis, cycling them through various necessary functions, from algae cultivators to hydrokinetic engineers.
On the planet Xylos, the sentient crystalline beings known as the Lumin transfer their consciousness into pre-designated host bodies every decade, experiencing life as farmers, artists, warriors, and even the planet's governing AI, ensuring a collective perspective.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A futuristic world where individuals are assigned jobs based on aptitude tests.
A society where individuals are genetically engineered for specific roles but can petition for reassignment.
A dystopian society where social class dictates career paths.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A world where individuals can upload their consciousness into virtual realities to experience different professions.
2. The nomadic K'thali tribes believe that true understanding comes from experiencing all facets of their society.  Each member, throughout their life, rotates through roles like hunter, weaver, storyteller, and spiritual leader, ensuring a shared communal experience. <<LEFTOVER>>
3. A culture where individuals apprentice in various crafts before choosing a specialization.
4. A world where people can swap bodies with others to experience different lives.
5. A culture where individuals are encouraged to try different jobs throughout their lives.
6. A society governed by a council of randomly selected citizens.
7. A society where individuals are assigned roles based on their birth order.
