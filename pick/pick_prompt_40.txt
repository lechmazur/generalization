Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A television series where the narrative arc focuses on the acceptance of religious beliefs as rational without needing evidential support, influencing character development.
A play where the main conflict revolves around characters accepting religious beliefs as foundational and not requiring justification through reason.
A film that explores the concept of religious belief as properly basic, with characters debating the nature of faith without empirical evidence.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A movie that explores the concept of faith but does not specifically address Reformed Epistemology.
A novel where characters struggle with their faith but do not discuss it in terms of Reformed Epistemology.
A movie that deals with the conflict between science and religion but does not mention Reformed Epistemology.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.
