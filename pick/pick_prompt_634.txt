Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A tong with a linear silver inlay on one arm
A whisk with a floral silver inlay on the handle
A spatula with a geometric silver inlay near the base

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A copper pot with a silver lid
A copper mixing bowl with a silver-plated interior
A copper rolling pin with silver end caps

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

1. A copper grater with a silver frame
2. A copper colander with silver handles
3. A set of copper measuring spoons with engraved silver markings
4. A copper pie server with a silver edge
5. A ladle with a swirling silver inlay along the handle <<LEFTOVER>>
