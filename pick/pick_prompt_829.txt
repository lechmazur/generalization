Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
a ceramic vase glazed with crushed meteorite dust, depicting the phases of the moon
a kinetic mobile of dried leaves and crystals that refracts sunlight into rainbows
a sundial crafted from polished stone and engraved with astronomical constellations

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
a telescope
a microscope
a model of the solar system

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. a star chart
2. a sculpture made of driftwood and embedded with bioluminescent algae <<LEFTOVER>>
3. a glass prism
4. a digital painting of a galaxy
5. a map of the constellations
6. a crystal geode
7. a photograph of a solar eclipse
8. a kaleidoscope
