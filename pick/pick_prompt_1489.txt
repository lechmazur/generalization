Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A traveler at an airport must wait at the designated gate for at least 15 minutes before boarding their flight.
A commuter at a train station must wait on the platform for a minimum of 8 minutes before the train arrives to take them to various destinations.
A student at a university must wait at the campus shuttle stop for at least 5 minutes before the shuttle arrives to transport them to different parts of the campus.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A traveler uses a ridesharing app to get a direct ride to their destination without waiting at a fixed point.
A commuter uses a bike-sharing system to travel directly to their destination without waiting.
A commuter uses a car-sharing service to pick up a vehicle and drive directly to their destination.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.
