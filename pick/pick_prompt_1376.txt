Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
a detective whose brain was copied into an AI system to solve crimes beyond their natural lifespan
a soldier whose consciousness was transferred into a combat drone to continue serving after a fatal injury
a scientist who uploaded their mind into a robotic body to continue their research after a terminal illness

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
a human who uploaded their consciousness into a virtual reality simulation
a human who became a digital entity but lost their original personality
a human who uploaded their memories to a computer but did not retain consciousness

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. a robot that inherited the memories of its creator after their death
2. a human who transferred their consciousness into an animal body
3. a sentient AI that believes it was once human but has no actual memories
4. a musician who preserved their mind in a holographic form to perform eternally after their physical death <<LEFTOVER>>
5. a human who uses a neural interface to control a robot remotely
6. a human who transferred their consciousness into a plant-based organism
7. a human brain preserved in a jar and connected to a computer
8. a clone created from the DNA of a deceased individual
