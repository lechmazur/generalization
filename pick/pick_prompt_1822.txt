Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Flooded fields for cranberry cultivation
Wetland rice farming in Africa
Paddy fields in Japan

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
Swamp-based agriculture in the Amazon
Canal irrigation in ancient civilizations
Drip irrigation for vineyards

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. Irrigation systems in desert agriculture
2. Water conservation techniques in arid regions
3. Aquaponics systems
4. Rice terraces in Southeast Asia <<LEFTOVER>>
5. Rainwater harvesting for crop irrigation
6. Subsurface drip irrigation in orchards
7. Greenhouse farming with hydroponics
8. Fish farming in ponds
