Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
An app that simulates the use of the astrolabe, a tool used by ancient Greek sailors for celestial navigation.
A digital platform that replicates the methods used by the Maya civilization to predict agricultural cycles based on celestial observations.
A software program that uses algorithms to mimic the star patterns used by Polynesian navigators for wayfinding.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A virtual planetarium that displays current night sky conditions.
A navigation system used by modern ships that relies on satellite data.
An app that helps users identify stars and planets visible in the night sky.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A program that simulates the movement of stars and planets for educational purposes.
2. A virtual reality system that recreates the night sky as seen by ancient Egyptian priests for astrological purposes. <<LEFTOVER>>
3. A smartphone app that provides real-time satellite imagery.
4. A modern GPS navigation system used in cars.
5. A digital tool for mapping constellations visible from different parts of the world.
6. A computer program that calculates the position of planets for astronomical research.
7. A virtual reality experience that allows users to explore the solar system.
8. A digital tool for tracking the phases of the moon for planning purposes.
