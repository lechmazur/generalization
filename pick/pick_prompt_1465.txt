Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The development of the internet, initially a secret project by the U.S. Department of Defense, which later transformed global communication and commerce.
The creation of GPS technology, originally developed by the U.S. military for navigation purposes, now widely used in civilian applications such as navigation systems in cars and smartphones.
The invention of the atomic clock, first developed in secret by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards, now essential for global timekeeping and telecommunications.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
The invention of the steam engine, which transformed industry and transportation, developed by private inventors.
The invention of the telephone, which revolutionized communication, developed by private inventors.
The development of the airplane, which transformed travel, developed by private inventors.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. The creation of the World Wide Web, developed at CERN, a publicly funded European research organization.
2. The invention of the printing press, which transformed information dissemination, developed by private inventors.
3. The discovery of the Higgs boson, a fundamental particle, made at a publicly funded research facility.
4. The invention of the electric battery, which transformed energy storage, developed by private inventors.
5. The invention of the refrigerator, which transformed food storage, developed by private inventors.
6. The discovery of synthetic rubber, initially researched in secret by the U.S. government during World War II, which later became crucial for the automotive and manufacturing industries. <<LEFTOVER>>
7. The invention of the transistor, which revolutionized electronics, developed in a corporate research lab.
8. The development of the laser, which has numerous applications, researched in academic and private institutions.
