Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
a wind turbine tower exceeding 100 feet that uses wind to rotate its blades and generate electricity
a tall chimney-like structure with internal turbines that harness updrafts from heated air to produce mechanical energy
a vertical-axis wind turbine over 100 feet tall designed to capture wind currents at high altitudes

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
a wind farm with turbines under 100 feet
a windmill under 100 feet tall
a solar updraft tower under 100 feet

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. a small wind-powered water desalination unit
2. a hydroelectric dam
3. a geothermal power plant
4. a tidal energy generator
5. a kite-based wind energy system
6. a wave energy converter
7. a small-scale residential wind turbine
8. a skyscraper-integrated wind funnel system that channels natural breezes to power internal turbines <<LEFTOVER>>
