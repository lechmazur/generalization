Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
a river nymph who aids fishermen but drowns those who disrespect her waters
a forest spirit that guards sacred groves but curses trespassers
a shapeshifting wolf that defends villages but hunts those who break ancient pacts

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
a mermaid who saves drowning sailors but curses those who betray her
a thunderbird that brings storms but protects sacred lands
a fairy that grants blessings but curses those who break promises

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. a mountain troll that protects travelers but punishes those who exploit the land <<LEFTOVER>>
2. a witch who curses intruders but heals those who seek her aid
3. a banshee whose wail foretells death but warns the innocent
4. a unicorn that heals the pure but attacks the corrupt
5. a kraken that sinks ships but spares those who honor the sea
6. a ghost that haunts a house but helps its former family
7. a siren that lures sailors but spares those who resist her song
8. a dragon that hoards treasure but spares those who offer gifts
