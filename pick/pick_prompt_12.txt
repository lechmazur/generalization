Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
the nitrogen cycle, where nitrogen is transformed from atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, and back to atmospheric nitrogen through processes like nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification
the life cycle of a butterfly, where an egg transforms into a caterpillar, then a pupa, and finally an adult butterfly
the carbon cycle, where carbon moves through the atmosphere, plants, animals, soil, and oceans via photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and combustion

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
the life cycle of a frog
the life cycle of a salmon
a food chain in an ecosystem

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. the decomposition of organic matter by bacteria
2. the process of digestion in animals
3. the process of photosynthesis in plants
4. the process of cellular respiration
5. the life cycle of a star
6. the water cycle, where water evaporates, condenses into clouds, precipitates as rain or snow, and flows through rivers and groundwater before evaporating again <<LEFTOVER>>
7. the formation of fossil fuels
8. the process of fermentation by yeast
