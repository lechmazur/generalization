Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
a bridge design with symmetrical arches and asymmetrical support beams
a garden layout with symmetrical hedges and asymmetrical flower beds
a building facade with symmetrical windows and an asymmetrical entrance

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
a chaotic abstract painting with no balance
a completely asymmetrical modern art sculpture
a completely asymmetrical treehouse

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. a lopsided bookshelf
2. a perfectly symmetrical cathedral
3. a spiral staircase with no symmetry
4. a single tree in the middle of a field
5. a room with a symmetrical chandelier and asymmetrical furniture arrangement <<LEFTOVER>>
6. a random pile of bricks
7. a random arrangement of rocks in a zen garden
8. a random scattering of leaves
