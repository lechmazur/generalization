Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
The myth of Phaethon's disastrous ride in the sun chariot, causing celestial chaos, is found in Greek mythology and has parallels in other mythologies.
The flood narrative, associated with a celestial event, appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Bible, and other ancient texts across different cultures.
The celestial event of the sun standing still, described in the Book of Joshua, has similarities in ancient Chinese and Mesoamerican records.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
The solar eclipse, a celestial event, noted in ancient Chinese, Mayan, and Greek records.
The lunar eclipse, a celestial event, noted in ancient Chinese, Babylonian, and Greek records.
The comet Halley, observed and documented in ancient Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European records.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.
