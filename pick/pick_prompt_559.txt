Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
a clown who performs cheerful acts but has a melancholic expression in their eyes
a sunny, vibrant painting with faint, shadowy figures lurking in the background
a person who laughs loudly at a joke but subtly clenches their fists in frustration

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
a person who openly expresses all their emotions without subtlety
a book where every characterâ€™s emotions are explicitly stated
a horror movie with a consistently eerie soundtrack

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. a movie where the protagonist is purely heroic with no flaws
2. a horror movie with a whimsical soundtrack that contrasts with its dark visuals <<LEFTOVER>>
3. a person who is consistently cheerful in all situations
4. a character who is always angry and never shows any other emotion
5. a song with lyrics that match the tone of the music perfectly
6. a character who is purely good with no internal struggles
7. a song with no emotional depth or complexity
8. a comedy show with no underlying serious themes
