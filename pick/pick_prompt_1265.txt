Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
A device that uses steam to power a piston, automating the process of pumping water from a mine.
A machine that employs a series of gears and levers to calculate mathematical equations, replacing manual computation.
An apparatus that harnesses steam to drive a series of mechanical arms, performing repetitive tasks in a factory setting.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
An electric motor that powers a conveyor belt in a manufacturing plant.
A diesel engine used in heavy machinery.
A nuclear-powered submarine.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A gas turbine used in aircraft propulsion.
2. A water wheel that generates power for a sawmill.
3. A hydraulic press used in metalworking.
4. An electric calculator for financial computations.
5. An electric-powered elevator in a building.
6. A contraption that utilizes steam pressure to move a carriage along a track, eliminating the need for animal-drawn transport. <<LEFTOVER>>
7. A battery-operated robot designed for household cleaning.
8. A gasoline-powered lawnmower.
