Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer used to quantify trace elements in a water sample.
A mass spectrometer used to determine the isotopic composition of a solid sample.
An X-ray fluorescence analyzer employed to identify the elemental makeup of a mineral specimen.

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A database that stores information about chemical compositions without direct sample interaction.
A software program that predicts molecular structures based on theoretical models.
A tool that calculates the energy content of a fuel based on its chemical formula.

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A pH meter that measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution.
2. A device that detects the presence of radiation in an environment.
3. A system that analyzes the color of a substance using a spectrophotometer.
4. A system that analyzes the particle size distribution of a powder.
5. A gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer for analyzing the chemical components of a volatile liquid sample. <<LEFTOVER>>
6. A tool that calculates the nutritional content of food based on a database of ingredients.
7. A handheld device that measures air quality without analyzing specific substances.
8. A device that detects the presence of specific gases in the air.
