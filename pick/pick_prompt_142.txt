Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Military outposts in frontier regions that evolved into settled towns and cities
Refugee camps established after World War II, some of which still exist today
Mining towns initially built with temporary housing that transitioned into permanent communities

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
A shanty town built without planning permission
A traveling circus
A recreational vehicle (RV)

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. A ghost town abandoned after a gold rush
2. A research station in Antarctica
3. Labor camps for large construction projects, like dams or railroads, that later became established settlements <<LEFTOVER>>
4. A seasonal ski resort
5. A tent used for camping
6. A cruise ship
7. An oil rig
