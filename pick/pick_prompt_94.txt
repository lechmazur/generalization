Here are three examples of a specific theme, rule, category, or criterion (referred to as "theme"):
Deciduous trees shedding leaves in autumn and regrowing them in spring
Annual wildflowers blooming in wet seasons and lying dormant in dry seasons
Hibernating animals entering a state of dormancy in winter and becoming active in spring

Here are three anti-examples that do not match this specific theme but can match a broader theme. They could follow various more general versions of this theme, or of themes that are connected, linked, associated with the specific theme BUT they are not examples of the exact theme. They are purposefully chosen to be misleading:
Migration patterns of birds
Seasons changing throughout the year
Life cycles of insects

Your task is to evaluate the candidates below on a scale of 0 (worst match) to 10 (best match) based on how well they match just the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples. For each candidate, output its score as an integer. These scores will be used for rankings, so ensure they are granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized (so not just 0s and 10s). Use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range (e.g. nothing but 0s or 1s). Follow this format:
<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
...
<number>8</number><score>4</score>

No additional comments are needed. Do not output the theme itself. Output English ONLY. You must use the specified tags.

Candidates:
1. Water levels in reservoirs fluctuating due to rainfall
2. Coral reefs undergoing bleaching during warmer periods and recovering during cooler periods <<LEFTOVER>>
3. Fluctuations in wildlife populations due to predation
4. Tides rising and falling daily
5. Weather patterns influenced by climate change
6. Day and night cycles
7. Annual cycles of tourism in coastal areas
8. Changes in ocean currents
