Explanation:

1. Euglena is a genus of single-celled flagellate protists that are capable of photosynthesis, similar to Dinobryon, Volvox, and Chlamydomonas. (Score: 8)
2. Zooplankton are small aquatic animals that drift with water currents, not single-celled photosynthetic organisms. (Score: 0)
3. Chemosynthetic bacteria obtain energy from chemical reactions instead of photosynthesis. (Score: 0)
4. Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotes, some of which are photosynthetic, like Dinobryon, Volvox, and Chlamydomonas. (Score: 7)
5. Lichen is a symbiotic relationship between fungi and photosynthetic algae or cyanobacteria, not a single-celled organism. (Score: 2)
6. Paramecium is a genus of single-celled ciliate protozoa that are not photosynthetic. (Score: 7)
7. Slime molds are not photosynthetic organisms; they are single-celled or multicellular organisms that can move and feed as a single mass. (Score: 1)
8. Photosynthetic bacteria are photosynthetic, but they are prokaryotic, unlike Dinobryon, Volvox, and Chlamydomonas, which are eukaryotic. (Score: 6)
