3. A chimney has a tall structure and is located on a roof, but it's primarily used for venting smoke and gases, not as an antenna or indicator. (Score: 5)
4. A gargoyle is a decorative element often found on buildings, sometimes at heights similar to the theme examples, but it doesn't serve the same functional purpose. (Score: 6)
5. A rooftop sculpture is a decorative element and doesn't serve the same functional purpose as the theme examples. (Score: 1)
6. A skylight is a window installed on a roof, but it doesn't match the theme, as it's used for letting in light, not as an antenna or indicator. (Score: 1)
7. A rooftop sign is a structure installed on a roof, but it's primarily used for advertising or displaying information, not as an antenna or indicator. (Score: 3)
