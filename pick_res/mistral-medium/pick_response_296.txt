7. Damaged lawn furniture in Detroit (5/10): This candidate is a moderate match for the specific theme as it involves a man-made structure, similar to the greenhouse, car, and storage shed.

8. Damaged satellite dish in Atlanta (3/10): This candidate is a poor match for the specific theme as it does not involve a greenhouse, car, or storage shed. It is similar to the damaged roof in Dallas, which is an anti-example, but it is not as strong of a match as the damaged roof.
