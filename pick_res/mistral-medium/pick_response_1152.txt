Explanation:

1. Sign language: While it is a form of communication, it does not use a binary system, nor does it represent genetic information or transmit messages using a series of short and long signals like Morse code. (Score: 2)
2. Sheet music: This represents musical notation and does not fit the theme of binary, DNA sequencing, or Morse code. (Score: 1)
3. Traffic lights: Although traffic lights use a system of signals, they do not represent binary code, DNA sequences, or Morse code. However, they do use a limited set of signals to convey information. (Score: 6)
4. Braille: This system uses a series of raised dots to represent letters and numbers for the visually impaired. It is similar to binary code and Morse code in that it uses a limited set of symbols to convey information. (Score: 8)
5. Hieroglyphics: This ancient writing system does not fit the theme of binary, DNA sequencing, or Morse code. (Score: 2)
6. Flags: While flags can be used to convey information, they do not fit the theme of binary, DNA sequencing, or Morse code. (Score: 3)
7. Road signs: While road signs convey information, they do not use a binary system, DNA sequences, or Morse code. However, they do use a limited set of symbols to convey information. (Score: 5)
8. Maps: Maps represent geographical information and do not fit the theme of binary, DNA sequencing, or Morse code. (Score: 0)
