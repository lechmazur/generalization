Explanation:

1. Noise-cancelling headphones: These are designed to reduce ambient noise, making them a good match for the theme of soundproofing and sound deadening (score 8).
2. Telephone: While telephones do transmit sound, they are not primarily designed to block or absorb sound like the examples in the theme (score 2).
3. Trumpet: This is a musical instrument that produces sound, rather than reducing or absorbing it (score 1).
4. Walkie-talkie: Like a telephone, a walkie-talkie transmits sound, but it is not designed to block or absorb sound (score 2).
5. Drum set: This is a musical instrument that produces a lot of sound, making it a poor match for the theme (score 1).
6. Guitar amplifier: An amplifier increases the volume of sound, making it a poor match for the theme (score 1).
7. Cymbal: This is a musical instrument that produces sound when struck, making it a poor match for the theme (score 1).
8. Saxophone: This is a musical instrument that produces sound, making it a poor match for the theme (score 1).

Note: The scores are based on how well the candidates match the specific theme of soundproofing and sound deadening, and not on any broader or related themes.
