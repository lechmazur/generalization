Explanation:

1. The Baptism of Christ by Verrocchio (2/10) - This painting depicts a religious event, but it does not involve a significant act of sacrifice, creation, or expulsion like the examples in the theme.
2. The Coronation of the Virgin by Fra Angelico (1/10) - This painting depicts the Virgin Mary being crowned by Jesus, which does not fit the theme of sacrifice, creation, or expulsion.
3. The Resurrection by Piero della Francesca (8/10) - This painting depicts Jesus' resurrection, which can be interpreted as a form of creation or rebirth, making it a strong match for the theme.
4. The Visitation by Pontormo (1/10) - This painting depicts Mary visiting her cousin Elizabeth, which does not fit the theme of sacrifice, creation, or expulsion.
5. The Story of Joseph by Pontormo (5/10) - This painting depicts several scenes from the story of Joseph, including his betrayal by his brothers and his eventual rise to power in Egypt. While there is an element of sacrifice in Joseph's betrayal, it is not a central theme of the painting.
6. The Assumption of the Virgin by Titian (1/10) - This painting depicts the Virgin Mary being assumed into heaven, which does not fit the theme of sacrifice, creation, or expulsion.
7. The Transfiguration by Raphael (6/10) - This painting depicts Jesus being transfigured on a mountaintop, with Moses and Elijah appearing beside him. While there is an element of transformation in the transfiguration, it is not a central theme of the painting.
8. The Adoration of the Magi by Botticelli (0/10) - This painting depicts the three wise men visiting the baby Jesus, which does not fit the theme of sacrifice, creation, or expulsion.
