Explanation:

1. A geyser (5): While not an exact match, geysers can have sudden and explosive releases of water and steam, similar to the bursting of a balloon or a lightning strike.
2. A volcano (2): Volcanic eruptions are more intense, prolonged, and destructive than the examples in the theme, making them a poor match.
3. A camera flash (8): Camera flashes are brief, bright bursts of light, closely resembling the sudden and fleeting nature of fireworks and lightning strikes.
4. A wildfire (1): Although wildfires can be intense and dramatic, they are not sudden or fleeting like the examples in the theme.
5. A sonic boom (6): Sonic booms are sudden, loud explosions caused by an object breaking the sound barrier, sharing some similarities with the bursting of a balloon.
6. A campfire (4): Campfires produce light and heat, but they are not sudden or brief like the examples in the theme.
7. An earthquake (0): Earthquakes involve the shaking or displacement of the Earth's surface, which does not match the sudden, bright, and fleeting nature of the theme.
8. A shooting star (9): Shooting stars are brief, bright streaks of light in the sky, closely resembling the sudden and fleeting nature of fireworks and lightning strikes.
