Explanation:

1. A smartphone app - Score 1: It does not match the theme of a self-contained system relying on external resources for certain supplies or functions.
2. A social media platform - Score 1: Similar to a smartphone app, it does not fit the theme of a self-contained system dependent on external resources.
3. A satellite orbiting Earth, dependent on ground stations for communication and control - Score 6: This is a borderline case, as satellites are self-contained systems but rely on ground stations for communication and control, which somewhat resembles the theme.
4. An ecosystem - Score 5: While ecosystems can be self-sustaining, they do not typically rely on external resources in the same way as the examples provided in the theme.
5. A beehive - Score 7: Beehives are self-contained systems that collect resources (e.g., nectar, pollen) from their environment, which aligns with the theme.
6. A colony of ants - Score 8: Ant colonies are highly self-sufficient and gather resources from their surroundings, making them a strong match for the theme.
7. An online multiplayer game - Score 2: This does not fit the theme, as online games are not self-contained systems that rely on external resources in the same way.
8. A power grid - Score 3: Power grids distribute electricity but are not self-contained systems that rely on external resources in the same way as the examples provided in the theme.
