Explanation:

1. A traffic light (5): It regulates the flow of traffic, similar to how a cell membrane regulates the flow of substances in and out of a cell or a firewall regulates data traffic.
2. A speed limit (2): It regulates the speed of vehicles, which is somewhat similar to regulation but not specifically related to the theme of controlling entry or access.
3. A wall (1): It provides a barrier, but it doesn't have the selective permeability or regulation aspect present in the theme examples.
4. A gate (8): It controls access to an area, much like a turnstile, cell membrane, or firewall, by allowing or denying entry based on certain criteria.
5. A fence (6): It provides a barrier and some level of control over entry, but it is not as selective or regulated as the theme examples.
6. A budget (0): It does not match the theme, as it is a financial plan and does not control access or regulate the flow of substances or data.
7. A cage (4): It provides a barrier and controls entry, but it is more restrictive and less selective than the theme examples.
8. A border (7): It controls access between two areas, similar to how a cell membrane, turnstile, or firewall regulates entry based on certain criteria.
