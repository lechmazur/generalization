Explanation:

1. Extremophiles (2/10): While some nematodes, rotifers, and brine shrimp can be extremophiles, not all extremophiles belong to the specific theme of microscopic aquatic invertebrates.
2. Fungi (0/10): Fungi are not microscopic aquatic invertebrates.
3. Cacti (0/10): Cacti are plants, not microscopic aquatic invertebrates.
4. Bacteria (6/10): Although bacteria are not invertebrates, they are microscopic organisms like the examples given. However, they are prokaryotes, not eukaryotes like nematodes, rotifers, and brine shrimp.
5. Succulents (0/10): Succulents are plants, not microscopic aquatic invertebrates.
6. Mosses (1/10): Mosses are plants, not microscopic aquatic invertebrates, but they can sometimes live in aquatic environments.
7. Archaea (8/10): Archaea are single-celled microorganisms like bacteria, but they are more closely related to eukaryotes than to bacteria. Some archaea are extremophiles and live in aquatic environments, making them a good match for the specific theme.
8. Tardigrades (5/10): Tardigrades are microscopic invertebrates like the examples given, but they are not aquatic organisms. They can survive in aquatic environments, but they are also found in terrestrial habitats.
