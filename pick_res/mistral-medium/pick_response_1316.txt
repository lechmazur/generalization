Explanation:

1. Jenga blocks: They are modular and can be connected, but they are not specifically designed to be interchangeable or to form complex structures like pipe fittings or modular furniture. (6/10)
2. Zipper: It consists of interlocking sections, similar to pipe fittings, but it is a linear connection rather than a multi-directional one. (8/10)
3. Velcro: It has two parts that connect and can be separated, similar to bayonet light bulb sockets. (8/10)
4. Tiles: They can be connected to form a larger surface, similar to modular furniture, but they are usually not designed to be rearranged frequently or to form complex structures. (7/10)
5. Screws and nuts: They are used to connect parts together, but they do not form interchangeable sections or modular systems like the examples in the theme. (2/10)
6. LEGO bricks: They are highly modular and interchangeable, allowing for the creation of complex structures, similar to pipe fittings and modular furniture. (10/10)
7. Electrical outlet and plug: They form a connection that can be easily separated and reconnected, similar to bayonet light bulb sockets. (9/10)
8. USB cable and port: They connect and disconnect easily, allowing for interchangeability, similar to the examples in the theme. (9/10)
