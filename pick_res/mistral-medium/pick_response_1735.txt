Explanation:

1. Lagrange multiplier (2/10): While it is a mathematical method used to solve optimization problems, it is not an iterative algorithm like the Gauss-Seidel method or Newton's method, nor does it deal with number theory like Euler's totient function.
2. Fourier transform (1/10): It is a mathematical transformation used to analyze signals in the frequency domain, which is not directly related to the theme of iterative algorithms or number theory.
3. Chebyshev polynomials (8/10): These are used in numerical analysis for approximation problems, making them somewhat similar to Newton's method. However, they are not iterative algorithms themselves.
4. Laplace transform (2/10): Like the Fourier transform, it is a mathematical transformation used to analyze signals, but it is not directly related to the theme of iterative algorithms or number theory.
5. Hilbert space (1/10): It is a concept from functional analysis, which is not directly related to the theme of iterative algorithms or number theory.
6. Riemann zeta function (6/10): While it is a function used in number theory, it is not an iterative algorithm like the Gauss-Seidel method or Newton's method.
7. Taylor series (9/10): It is an iterative algorithm used to approximate functions, making it very similar to Newton's method.
8. Bayesian probability (0/10): It is a concept from probability theory, which is not directly related to the theme of iterative algorithms or number theory.
