Explanation:

1. Ancient burial sites (2/10): While these can contain remains of ancient humans, they are not specific to the Homo genus or the species listed in the theme.
2. Fossilized plant remains (1/10): This is completely unrelated to the theme of specific Homo species.
3. Ancient human footprints (6/10): Although not limited to the species in the theme, footprints can be left by Homo species and provide evidence of their existence.
4. Genetic studies of ancient populations (3/10): This is somewhat related to the theme, but it is not limited to the specific species listed.
5. Australopithecus afarensis (5/10): This is an ancient hominid species, but it is not part of the Homo genus, so it does not match the theme exactly.
6. Archaeological sites (2/10): Archaeological sites can contain evidence of various ancient species, not just the specific Homo species in the theme.
7. Mitochondrial DNA analysis (3/10): This technique can be used to study ancient human populations, but it is not limited to the specific species in the theme.
8. Modern human skeletal remains (8/10): While these are not the specific extinct species in the theme, they are still part of the Homo genus (Homo sapiens) and closely related to the species listed.
