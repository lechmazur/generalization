Explanation:

1. Drums for communication (score: 1) - This is a very poor match for the specific theme of fiber optic cables, satellite communication, and cellular networks. Drums are an ancient method of communication that does not involve modern technology or telecommunications.
2. Internet routers (score: 6) - While internet routers are not a direct example of the specific theme, they are closely related to it. Routers are used to connect devices to the internet, which often relies on fiber optic cables, satellite communication, and cellular networks.
3. Television broadcasting (score: 5) - Television broadcasting is somewhat related to the specific theme, as it involves transmitting signals over long distances. However, it is not a perfect match, as the signals are typically transmitted through the air rather than through cables or satellites.
4. Radio waves (score: 7) - Radio waves are a close match for the specific theme, as they are used in satellite communication and cellular networks. They are also used in other forms of wireless communication, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
5. Telegraph (score: 2) - The telegraph is an early form of communication that relies on electrical signals sent through wires. While it is somewhat related to the specific theme, it is not a modern form of telecommunications and does not involve fiber optics or satellites.
6. Light signals (score: 3) - Light signals are not a direct match for the specific theme, but they are used in some forms of optical communication, such as Li-Fi. However, they are not commonly used in fiber optic cables, satellite communication, or cellular networks.
7. Morse code (score: 1) - Morse code is a method of communication that uses a series of short and long signals to represent letters and numbers. While it can be used in various forms of communication, it is not a direct match for the specific theme of fiber optic cables, satellite communication, and cellular networks.
8. Carrier pigeons (score: 0) - Carrier pigeons are an ancient method of communication that involves sending messages attached to the legs of pigeons. This is a very poor match for the specific theme of fiber optic cables, satellite communication, and cellular networks.
