Explanation:

1. Telescope (5): While not made of brass, it is an instrument used in astronomy like the astrolabe.
2. Sextant (6): A navigational instrument often made of brass, but not used primarily for meteorology or biology like the barometer and microscope.
3. Thermometer (8): Closely related to the barometer as it measures atmospheric conditions, and could be made of brass.
4. Mercury barometer (9): Almost a perfect match, as it is a type of barometer and often made of brass.
5. Astronomical clock (2): This is a timekeeping device with astronomical displays, but it does not fit the theme of brass scientific instruments for measuring natural phenomena.
6. Hygrometer (7): Measures humidity, which is related to the barometer's function of measuring atmospheric pressure, and could be made of brass.
7. Chronometer (4): A precise timekeeping instrument, often made of brass, but not directly related to meteorology or biology.
8. Orrery (3): A mechanical model of the solar system, which is related to the broader theme of scientific instruments but not specifically brass instruments for measuring natural phenomena.
