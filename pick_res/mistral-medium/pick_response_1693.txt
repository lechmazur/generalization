Explanation:

1. Continental shelf (score: 2) - While not a direct match, it is a geological feature that is connected to the theme of underwater formations. However, it is not a ridge, seamount, or guyot.
2. Submarine canyon (score: 1) - This is a type of underwater valley, not a ridge, seamount, or guyot.
3. Hydrothermal vent (score: 1) - This is an opening in the ocean floor that releases geothermally heated water, not a ridge, seamount, or guyot.
4. Atoll (score: 2) - An atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef or island, not a ridge, seamount, or guyot. However, it can be associated with seamounts or guyots.
5. Ocean trench (score: 1) - This is a long, narrow, and deep depression in the ocean floor, not a ridge, seamount, or guyot.
6. Floating fish aggregating device (FAD) (score: 1) - This is a man-made object used to attract fish, not a natural underwater formation.
7. Deep-sea vent (score: 1) - Similar to hydrothermal vents, these are openings in the ocean floor that release mineral-rich water, not a ridge, seamount, or guyot.
8. Estuary (score: 1) - This is a partially enclosed coastal body of water where freshwater from rivers mixes with seawater, not a ridge, seamount, or guyot.
