Explanation:

1. The Reagan Revolution (6): This candidate has some similarities to the theme as it involves a significant political and social change, but it is not a complete overthrow or conquest of an existing power structure.
2. The Vietnam War (2): This candidate does not match the theme as it is primarily a military conflict and does not involve a change in political power or social structure.
3. The Opium Wars (4): This candidate has some similarities to the theme as it involves a foreign power (Britain) imposing its will on a weaker power (China), but it is not a complete overthrow or conquest of an existing power structure.
4. The Industrial Revolution (1): This candidate does not match the theme as it is primarily an economic and technological change, not a political or social one.
5. The Cold War (2): This candidate does not match the theme as it is primarily a geopolitical conflict between two superpowers, not a change in political power or social structure within a single country.
6. The Fall of Constantinople (8): This candidate is a strong match for the theme as it involves the complete overthrow and conquest of an existing power structure (the Byzantine Empire) by a foreign power (the Ottoman Empire).
7. The Partition of India (6): This candidate has some similarities to the theme as it involves a significant political and social change, but it is not a complete overthrow or conquest of an existing power structure.
