Explanation:

1. Mira variable - Score 2: Mira variables are pulsating variable stars, but they are not eclipsing binaries like the examples given.
2. Cataclysmic variable star - Score 0: These are close binary systems where one star is a white dwarf accreting matter from its companion, not an eclipsing binary system.
3. RS Canum Venaticorum variable - Score 8: These are close binary systems that exhibit large, irregular variations in brightness due to starspots. They are eclipsing binaries, making them a good match for the theme.
4. Rotating variable star - Score 4: These stars vary in brightness due to starspots or other surface inhomogeneities. While they may be part of a binary system, they are not necessarily eclipsing binaries.
5. RR Lyrae variable - Score 9: These are pulsating variable stars that are also eclipsing binaries, making them a very good match for the theme.
6. Pulsar - Score 0: Pulsars are highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation. They are not eclipsing binary systems.
7. T Tauri star - Score 1: These are young, variable stars that have not yet reached the main sequence. While they may be part of a binary system, they are not necessarily eclipsing binaries.
8. Beta Lyrae - Score 6: This is an eclipsing binary system where both stars are close enough to share a common envelope of gas. While it is an eclipsing binary, it is not a typical example of the theme.
