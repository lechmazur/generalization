Explanation:

1. Coral skeleton (2/10): While it has an intricate structure, it is not man-made or produced through additive manufacturing.
2. Foam core sandwich panel (6/10): This design has an optimized internal structure, but it is not made using additive manufacturing or 3D printing.
3. Truss bridge design (5/10): The truss design optimizes structural integrity, but it is not made using additive manufacturing or 3D printing.
4. Plant stem (1/10): This is a natural structure, not man-made or produced through additive manufacturing.
5. Spider web (1/10): This is a natural structure created by a spider, not man-made or produced through additive manufacturing.
6. Geodesic dome (7/10): While not explicitly made using additive manufacturing, the design is optimized and could potentially be 3D printed.
7. Corrugated cardboard (6/10): The structure is optimized, and it could be argued that the layering process is somewhat similar to additive manufacturing, but it is not made using 3D printing or selective laser melting.
8. 3D printed titanium bicycle frame (9/10): This is a custom design made using additive manufacturing, specifically 3D printing, and is the closest match to the theme.
