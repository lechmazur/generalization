Explanation:

1. Continental drift (1) is a slow process of movement in the Earth's tectonic plates, not a transformation of one substance into another.
2. Rust forming on metal (6) involves the oxidation of iron, which can be considered a transformation process, but it is not creating a new usable substance like the examples in the theme.
3. Star formation (1) is the process of gas and dust in space collapsing under gravity to form a new star, which does not fit the theme of refining or transforming raw materials into useful products.
4. A caterpillar becoming a butterfly (5) is a biological transformation, but it does not involve refining or transforming raw materials into useful products.
5. Radioactive decay (2) is the process of an unstable atomic nucleus losing energy by emitting radiation, which does not fit the theme of refining or transforming raw materials into useful products.
6. Smelting iron ore into steel (8) is a process of refining and transforming raw materials into a useful product, which closely matches the theme.
7. Volcanic eruption (2) is the process of magma and gas being expelled from a volcano, which does not fit the theme of refining or transforming raw materials into useful products.
8. Leaves changing color in autumn (4) is a biological process caused by the breakdown of chlorophyll, but it does not involve refining or transforming raw materials into useful products.
