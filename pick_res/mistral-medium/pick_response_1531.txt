A swamp used to symbolize a complex and difficult-to-navigate situation in a problem-solving app. (5) - This score is in the middle because while a swamp can represent a challenging situation, it does not directly relate to the theme of mountain peaks, canyons, or caves representing levels, dives, or hidden features.
2. A storm used to indicate turbulent conditions in a weather forecasting application. (0) - This example does not match the specific theme, as it does not involve levels, dives, or hidden features.
