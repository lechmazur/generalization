Explanation:

1. A pair of binoculars (score: 1) - This does not match the theme as it does not provide real-time audio or tactile feedback related to animal behavior or movement.
2. A handheld GPS device (score: 2) - While it can be used for tracking, it does not provide real-time audio or tactile feedback related to animal behavior or movement.
3. An underwater camera (score: 3) - This comes closer to the theme as it can be used to observe animal behavior, but it does not provide real-time audio or tactile feedback.
4. A satellite tracking collar (score: 5) - This matches the theme somewhat as it is used to track animal movements, but it does not provide real-time audio or tactile feedback.
5. A trail mapping app (score: 4) - This does not fully match the theme as it is primarily used for mapping and navigation rather than providing real-time audio or tactile feedback related to animal behavior or movement.
6. A fish finder device (score: 6) - This matches the theme fairly well as it provides real-time feedback (visual) related to animal movement (fish), but it does not provide audio or tactile feedback.
7. A plant identification scanner (score: 2) - This does not match the theme as it is not related to animal behavior or movement.
8. A haptic glove that simulates different tree bark textures for forest research (score: 8) - This matches the theme quite well as it provides tactile feedback related to the natural environment, although it is not directly related to animal behavior or movement.
