Explanation:

1. Nautical chart (2/10): While it is a tool used for navigation, it does not directly relate to the theme of communication signals at sea.
2. Lead line (1/10): This is a measuring device used to determine the depth of water and the nature of the sea bottom, not a communication signal.
3. Parallel rule (2/10): This is a tool used for measuring distances on charts or maps, not a communication signal.
4. Pelorus (5/10): A pelorus is a type of compass used to measure the angle between two objects. It is not a communication signal, but it is closer to the theme than some other candidates because it involves determining the direction of a signal (albeit not a communication signal).
5. Lighthouse (6/10): While a lighthouse is a navigational aid that provides a visual signal to mariners, it is not a communication signal in the same sense as the examples given in the theme. However, it is closer to the theme than some other candidates because it involves transmitting information to other vessels.
6. Traverse board (1/10): This is a tool used to record the course and distance traveled by a vessel, not a communication signal.
7. Chip log (1/10): This is a device used to measure the speed of a vessel through the water, not a communication signal.
8. Dividers (1/10): This is a tool used for measuring distances on charts or maps, not a communication signal.
