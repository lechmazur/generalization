Explanation:

1. Figure of Emperor Claudius made from a single block of marble (score: 1) - This candidate does not match the specific theme as it is made from marble, not gabbro, diorite, or basalt.
2. Portrait of General Germanicus crafted from a single piece of marble (score: 1) - This candidate also does not match the specific theme as it is made from marble.
3. Portrait of General Lucius Verus crafted from a single piece of andesite (score: 6) - This candidate partially matches the specific theme as it is made from a single piece of stone, but it is not gabbro, diorite, or basalt.
