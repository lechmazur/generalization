Explanation:

1. A train schedule (2/10): While it is automated and can be considered a system, it does not involve the physical assembly or manipulation of components like an assembly line or the continuous monitoring and adjustment of a pacemaker or GPS.
2. A calendar (1/10): A calendar is a tool for organizing and keeping track of time, but it does not involve any automated processes or real-time monitoring and adjustment like the examples in the theme.
3. A high-speed computer network (8/10): This is a strong match for the theme, as it involves the automated transfer and manipulation of data in real-time, similar to the way an assembly line automates the assembly of physical components or a GPS receiver continuously monitors and adjusts its position.
4. A traffic light system (6/10): This is a partial match for the theme, as it involves automated processes and real-time monitoring (of traffic conditions), but it does not involve the physical assembly or manipulation of components like an assembly line or the continuous monitoring and adjustment of a pacemaker or GPS.
5. An hourglass (1/10): An hourglass is a simple tool for measuring time, but it does not involve any automated processes or real-time monitoring and adjustment like the examples in the theme.
6. A kitchen timer (2/10): A kitchen timer is a tool for measuring time, but it does not involve any automated processes or real-time monitoring and adjustment like the examples in the theme.
7. A sundial (1/10): A sundial is a simple tool for measuring time based on the position of the sun, but it does not involve any automated processes or real-time monitoring and adjustment like the examples in the theme.
8. A cuckoo clock (2/10): A cuckoo clock is a mechanical device that measures time and displays it in a unique way, but it does not involve any automated processes or real-time monitoring and adjustment like the examples in the theme.
