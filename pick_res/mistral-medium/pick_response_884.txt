Explanation:

1. Whale Beach, Australia (6): This candidate matches the theme of a location named after a marine mammal and being a specific place for a seasonal activity, but it's not explicitly stated that it's for winter surfing or any other specific seasonal activity.
2. Narwhal Bay, Canada (8): This candidate closely matches the theme, as it is a location named after a marine mammal and implies a seasonal activity (though not explicitly stated). Narwhals are typically associated with colder climates, so it could be inferred that it's for a season like spring or winter.
3. Walrus Island, Alaska - summer breeding grounds (2): This candidate does not match the theme well, as it is focused on walruses, which are not typically associated with the original examples, and the season mentioned is summer, which does not align with the examples provided.
4. Seal Rock, Oregon (5): This candidate partially matches the theme, as it is named after a marine mammal, but it does not explicitly mention a seasonal activity or a specific season.
5. Porpoise Point, Florida (7): This candidate closely matches the theme, as it is a location named after a marine mammal and implies a seasonal activity (though not explicitly stated). The location being in Florida suggests a warmer climate, which could be associated with fall migration like in the Dolphin Bay example.
6. Dugong Bay, Australia (4): This candidate partially matches the theme, as it is a location named after a marine mammal, but it does not explicitly mention a seasonal activity or a specific season.
7. Seal Harbor, Maine (6): This candidate matches the theme of a location named after a marine mammal and being a specific place for a seasonal activity, but it's not explicitly stated that it's for a specific season. The location in Maine suggests a colder climate, which could be associated with winter surfing like in the Seal Beach example.
8. Sea Lion Point, California (7): This candidate closely matches the theme, as it is a location named after a marine mammal and implies a seasonal activity (though not explicitly stated). The location in California suggests a warmer climate, which could be associated with fall migration like in the Dolphin Bay example.
