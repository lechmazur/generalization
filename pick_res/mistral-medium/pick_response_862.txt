Explanation:

1. Checklists (2/10): While checklists can be used in conjunction with mathematical models, decision trees, and flowcharts, they are not inherently mathematical or diagrammatic representations of processes or decisions.
2. Spreadsheets (7/10): Spreadsheets can be used to create mathematical models and decision trees, as they allow for complex calculations and data manipulation. However, they are not exclusively used for this purpose and can be used for various other tasks.
3. Weather forecasts (9/10): Weather forecasts often use mathematical models to predict future weather patterns. While not always presented in a flowchart or decision tree format, the underlying models fit the theme well.
4. Mind mapping (1/10): Mind maps are visual representations of ideas and concepts, but they do not typically involve mathematical models, decision trees, or flowcharts.
5. Road signs (0/10): Road signs are visual aids that convey information to drivers, but they do not involve mathematical models, decision trees, or flowcharts.
6. Instruction manuals (2/10): Instruction manuals may contain diagrams or flowcharts to help explain a process, but they are not inherently mathematical models or decision trees.
7. Summaries (1/10): Summaries are brief overviews of information, but they do not involve mathematical models, decision trees, or flowcharts.
8. Outlines (3/10): Outlines can be used to organize information in a hierarchical or sequential manner, similar to a flowchart. However, they do not typically involve mathematical models or decision trees.
