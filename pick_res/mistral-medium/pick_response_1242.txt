Explanation:

1. Circular saw blade (1/10): This candidate does not match the theme of measuring devices used for navigation or astronomy.
2. Compass rose (6/10): Although a compass rose is used for navigation, it is not a device for measuring angles or time like a protractor, astrolabe, or sundial. However, it is closer to the theme than the other candidates.
3. Roulette wheel (2/10): This candidate does not match the theme as it is a game device used for gambling, not for navigation or astronomy.
4. CD-ROM (0/10): This candidate does not match the theme as it is a digital storage device, not a measuring device used for navigation or astronomy.
5. Steering wheel (0/10): This candidate does not match the theme as it is used for controlling vehicles, not for measuring angles or time.
6. Ship's helm (7/10): Although a ship's helm is used for steering a ship, it is also used for determining the ship's course and angle relative to the wind or water. This makes it a closer match to the theme than some of the other candidates.
7. Pie chart (1/10): This candidate does not match the theme as it is a data visualization tool, not a measuring device used for navigation or astronomy.
8. Vinyl record (1/10): This candidate does not match the theme as it is a medium for storing and playing music, not a measuring device used for navigation or astronomy.
