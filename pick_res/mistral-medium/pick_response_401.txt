Explanation:

1. A coastline has some self-similarity, but it is not a perfect match for the theme of fractal patterns, snowflakes, and cellular automaton patterns. (Score: 4)
2. A spider web has a branching pattern that resembles a fractal tree, but it is not generated by the same rules as a cellular automaton or snowflake. (Score: 8)
3. A flock of birds can exhibit emergent patterns, but these patterns are not generated by the same rules as a cellular automaton or the growth of a snowflake or fractal tree. (Score: 2)
4. A river delta has a branching pattern that is somewhat similar to a fractal tree, but it is not generated by the same rules as a cellular automaton or the growth of a snowflake. (Score: 6)
5. A bacterial colony can exhibit complex patterns, but these patterns are not generated by the same rules as a cellular automaton or the growth of a snowflake or fractal tree. (Score: 5)
6. A coral reef has a complex, branching structure that is somewhat similar to a fractal tree, but it is not generated by the same rules as a cellular automaton or the growth of a snowflake. (Score: 7)
7. A weather system does not exhibit the same kind of self-similarity or pattern generation as a cellular automaton, snowflake, or fractal tree. (Score: 1)
8. A termite mound has a complex, branching structure that is somewhat similar to a fractal tree, but it is not generated by the same rules as a cellular automaton or the growth of a snowflake. (Score: 6)
