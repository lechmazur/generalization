Explanation:

1. Floating dock - Score 2: While not specifically a river training structure, a floating dock can be used in conjunction with jetties or wing dykes to help manage water flow and provide additional stability.
2. Groyne - Score 9: A groyne is a structure built perpendicular to the shoreline to prevent erosion and manage water flow, making it very similar to a jetty or wing dyke.
3. Culvert - Score 1: A culvert is a tunnel-like structure that allows water to flow underneath obstacles, such as roads or railways. It does not directly manage river flow like the theme examples.
4. Water wheel - Score 0: A water wheel is a device that uses flowing or falling water to generate power, not a river training structure.
5. Spillway - Score 0: A spillway is a structure used to release excess water from a dam or reservoir, not a river training structure.
6. Canal - Score 0: A canal is a man-made waterway used for transportation, irrigation, or water supply, not a river training structure.
7. Lock gate - Score 0: A lock gate is a gate used in canals and rivers to control water levels and allow boats to pass through, not a river training structure.
8. Fish ladder - Score 0: A fish ladder is a structure designed to help fish navigate around obstacles, such as dams or weirs, not a river training structure.
