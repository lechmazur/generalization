Explanation:

1. Pulley (2/10): While a pulley can be used in conjunction with hydraulic systems, it is not a primary component of a hydraulic cylinder, gearbox, or torque converter.
2. Wheel (6/10): A wheel can be part of a gearbox system, but it is not a defining feature of the theme.
3. Axle (6/10): An axle can be connected to a gearbox, but it is not a primary component of the theme.
4. Electric motor (1/10): An electric motor does not fit the theme, as it is not a hydraulic or transmission component.
5. Turbine (2/10): A turbine is not a primary component of the theme, but it can be connected to a hydraulic system or a gearbox in some applications.
6. Lever (3/10): A lever is not a primary component of the theme, but it can be used in conjunction with hydraulic systems or gearboxes.
7. Spring (1/10): A spring is not a primary component of the theme, but it can be used in conjunction with hydraulic systems or transmissions.
8. Engine (8/10): An engine can be connected to a gearbox or torque converter, making it a strong match for the theme. However, it is not a defining feature of hydraulic cylinders.
