Explanation:

1. Wolf Creek Pass (7): This candidate closely matches the theme as it includes the name of an animal (wolf) and a geographical feature (pass).
2. Coyote Valley (6): This candidate also matches the theme well, featuring an animal (coyote) and a geographical feature (valley).
3. Hawk Ridge (5): Although hawk is an animal, the term "ridge" is not as prominent a geographical feature as peak, mountain, or hill. Thus, it gets a slightly lower score.
4. Bear Butte, South Dakota (8): This candidate strongly matches the theme, featuring an animal (bear) and a prominent geographical feature (butte).
5. Bear Lake (2): While this candidate includes an animal (bear), it does not feature a prominent geographical feature like peak, mountain, or hill. Instead, it has "lake," which is not as closely related to the theme.
6. Fox River (6): This candidate matches the theme fairly well, featuring an animal (fox) and a geographical feature (river). However, "river" is not as closely related to the theme as peak, mountain, or hill.
7. Shark Bay (1): This candidate only weakly matches the theme, as it features an animal (shark) and a geographical feature (bay). However, "bay" is not as closely related to the theme as peak, mountain, or hill.
8. Snake River (4): This candidate matches the theme to some extent, featuring an animal (snake) and a geographical feature (river). However, "river" is not as closely related to the theme as peak, mountain, or hill.
