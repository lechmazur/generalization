Explanation:

1. A river flooding after heavy rain (score: 2) - This event can take hours to days, which is faster than the examples in the theme.
2. A child growing taller over a summer (score: 5) - While growth is a slow process, it is noticeable over a shorter timescale than the theme's examples.
3. A tree growing visibly over a year (score: 6) - This event occurs on a slower timescale than the previous example but still faster than the theme's examples.
4. A dam breaking under pressure (score: 0) - This event is sudden and catastrophic, unlike the gradual processes in the theme.
5. A landslide occurring after heavy rainfall (score: 1) - Landslides can happen quickly, making them a poor match for the theme.
6. The gradual erosion of a mountain range over millions of years (score: 9) - This example closely matches the theme, as it involves slow, imperceptible changes over an extended period.
7. A forest fire spreading rapidly (score: 0) - Forest fires spread quickly and destructively, which is the opposite of the slow, gradual processes in the theme.
8. A building collapsing in an earthquake (score: 0) - This event is sudden and catastrophic, unlike the gradual processes in the theme.
