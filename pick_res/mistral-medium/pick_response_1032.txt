Explanation:

1. A pulley system (2/10) - This candidate involves mechanical systems, but it does not involve the specific theme of electronic or automated control systems.
2. A termite mound's internal ventilation (6/10) - This candidate involves an automated system that regulates the environment, similar to the background app refresh and electronic fuel injection examples. However, it is a natural system rather than an electronic one.
3. A steam engine (1/10) - This candidate involves a mechanical system, but it does not involve the specific theme of electronic or automated control systems.
4. A pinball machine (4/10) - This candidate involves mechanical and electronic systems, but it does not involve the specific theme of automated control systems that regulate an internal environment or process.
5. A door lock (0/10) - This candidate involves a mechanical system, but it does not involve the specific theme of electronic or automated control systems.
6. A bicycle gear chain (5/10) - This candidate involves a mechanical system, but it does involve the concept of regulating a process (the speed and power of the bicycle). However, it is not an electronic or automated system.
7. A music box (3/10) - This candidate involves a mechanical system, but it does not involve the specific theme of electronic or automated control systems.
8. A vending machine (5/10) - This candidate involves an electronic system that regulates an internal process (dispensing items), but it is not specifically related to the theme of background app refresh or electronic fuel injection.
