Explanation:

1. A mountain troll that protects travelers but punishes those who exploit the land (5/10) - This candidate is somewhat close to the theme as it involves a supernatural entity that both protects and punishes based on certain actions. However, the theme is not specifically tied to natural elements like rivers, forests, or villages, so it's not a perfect match.
2. A witch who curses intruders but heals those who seek her aid (7/10) - This candidate is quite close to the theme, as it involves a supernatural entity that both protects and punishes based on certain actions. The main difference is that the witch's domain is not explicitly tied to a natural element, but her actions still follow the pattern of the theme.
3. A banshee whose wail foretells death but warns the innocent (6/10) - This candidate is somewhat close to the theme, as it involves a supernatural entity that both helps and harms based on certain conditions. However, the theme is not specifically about foretelling events or issuing warnings, so it's not a perfect match.
4. A unicorn that heals the pure but attacks the corrupt (4/10) - This candidate is somewhat distant from the theme, as it involves a supernatural entity that both helps and harms based on certain moral conditions. However, the theme is more about protecting specific natural elements or territories, rather than making moral judgments.
5. A kraken that sinks ships but spares those who honor the sea (8/10) - This candidate is very close to the theme, as it involves a supernatural entity that both protects and punishes based on certain actions related to a natural element (the sea). The main difference is that the kraken does not specifically aid those who interact with it positively, but it still follows the overall pattern of the theme.
6. A ghost that haunts a house but helps its former family (3/10) - This candidate is somewhat distant from the theme, as it involves a supernatural entity that both helps and harms based on certain conditions. However, the theme is more about protecting specific natural elements or territories, rather than being tied to a specific location like a house.
7. A siren that lures sailors but spares those who resist her song (2/10) - This candidate is quite distant from the theme, as it involves a supernatural entity that both helps and harms based on certain actions. However, the theme is more about protecting specific natural elements or territories, rather than testing the willpower of individuals.
8. A dragon that hoards treasure but spares those who offer gifts (9/10) - This candidate is very close to the theme, as it involves a supernatural entity that both protects and punishes based on certain actions related to its domain (its hoard). The main difference is that the dragon's domain is not explicitly tied to a natural element like a river or forest, but it still follows the overall pattern of the theme.
