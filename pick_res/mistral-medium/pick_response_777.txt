Explanation:

1. Evaporation of water from lakes and oceans (1/10): This does not involve water spreading from a source to surrounding areas due to natural processes like floods, glacial melt, or groundwater recharge.
2. Water storage in reservoirs for human use (2/10): Although reservoirs may receive water from rivers, this example focuses on human-made storage rather than natural water spreading.
3. Water flow in artificial canals (5/10): While this involves water flowing from one place to another, it is human-made and does not directly match the theme of natural water spreading.
4. Water vapor condensation into clouds (1/10): This is not related to the theme of water spreading from a source to surrounding areas.
5. Water filtration through natural wetlands (7/10): This example involves water spreading from a source (river or lake) to surrounding areas (wetlands), which helps filter and purify the water.
6. Water flow in man-made drainage systems (6/10): Similar to artificial canals, this involves human-made structures for water flow, but it can also be related to natural water spreading in urban areas.
7. Stormwater management systems in urban areas (6/10): These systems help manage and control the natural spread of water during heavy rainfall events, making it somewhat related to the theme.
8. Water vapor transport through atmospheric rivers leading to precipitation in different regions (3/10): Although this involves water moving from one place to another, it is not directly related to the theme of water spreading from a source to surrounding areas on land.
