Explanation:

1. A zip tie is not a type of nut or rivet, but it does serve a similar function in fastening materials together, so it gets a score of 2.
2. A toggle bolt is not a type of nut or rivet either, but it does involve a mechanism that expands to hold the bolt in place, similar to a blind rivet, so it gets a score of 5.
3. A key ring is not a type of nut or rivet and does not serve a similar function, so it gets a score of 1.
4. A snap fastener is not a type of nut or rivet, but it does involve a mechanism that holds materials together, similar to a rivet nut, so it gets a score of 6.
5. A carabiner is not a type of nut or rivet, but it does involve a mechanism that holds materials together, similar to a rivet nut, and it is often used in conjunction with nuts and bolts, so it gets a score of 8.
6. A latch is not a type of nut or rivet and does not serve a similar function, but it does involve a mechanism that holds materials together, so it gets a score of 4.
7. A hook is not a type of nut or rivet and does not serve a similar function, but it does involve a mechanism that holds materials together, so it gets a score of 3.
8. A nut is a direct match to the theme, so it gets a score of 9. It is not a perfect match because the theme specified a "well nut," "blind rivet," or "rivet nut," which are specific types of nuts or fasteners.
