Explanation:

1. Air resistance - This is a force that opposes the motion of an object through the air. It is not a fundamental force like electromagnetism or the nuclear forces. Score: 1
2. Elasticity - This is the property of a material to return to its original shape after being deformed. It is not a fundamental force. Score: 2
3. Gravity - This is a fundamental force, but it is not one of the examples given in the theme. It is a force that attracts two objects with mass towards each other. Score: 1
4. Buoyancy - This is the force that causes an object to float or rise in a fluid. It is not a fundamental force. Score: 1
5. Centripetal force - This is the force that keeps an object moving in a circular path. It is not a fundamental force. Score: 1
6. Viscosity - This is the resistance of a fluid to flow. It is not a fundamental force. Score: 1
7. Momentum - This is the product of an object's mass and velocity. It is a property of an object, not a fundamental force. Score: 2
8. Inertia - This is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion. It is a property of an object, not a fundamental force. Score: 2

Note: The scores are based on how well the candidates match the specific theme of electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force. They are not based on how well they match a broader or related theme.
