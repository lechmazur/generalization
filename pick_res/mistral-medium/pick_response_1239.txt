Explanation:

1. Cube - A three-dimensional shape with six square faces. It does not spin or rotate around an axis like the examples in the theme. (0)
2. Ferris wheel - Although it rotates, it does not spin around a central axis like the examples in the theme. Instead, it has multiple gondolas that rotate around the outer rim. (6)
3. Pentagonal prism - A three-dimensional shape with two pentagonal faces and five rectangular faces. It does not spin or rotate around an axis like the examples in the theme. (0)
4. Octahedron - A polyhedron with eight triangular faces. It does not spin or rotate around an axis like the examples in the theme. (0)
5. Icosahedron - A polyhedron with twenty triangular faces. It does not spin or rotate around an axis like the examples in the theme. (0)
6. Paraboloid - A three-dimensional shape that resembles a parabola. It does not spin or rotate around an axis like the examples in the theme, but it has a curved surface that might be misleading. (1)
7. Hexagonal prism - A three-dimensional shape with two hexagonal faces and six rectangular faces. It does not spin or rotate around an axis like the examples in the theme. (0)
8. Ellipsoid - A three-dimensional shape with three curved surfaces that resemble ellipses. It does not spin or rotate around an axis like the examples in the theme, but it has a curved surface that might be misleading. (2)
