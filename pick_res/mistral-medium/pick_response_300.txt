Explanation:

1. A plastic toy sword with a glued handle. (1) - This is a very poor match as it uses glue and plastic, which are not natural materials like rawhide, plant fibers, or leather.
2. A garden hoe with a metal blade and wooden handle connected by a bolt. (2) - This is a slightly better match than the first example, but still quite poor because it uses a metal bolt instead of natural binding materials.
3. A bamboo fishing rod with sections connected by ferrules. (1) - This is another poor match, as it uses metal ferrules instead of natural binding materials.
4. A kitchen knife with a handle attached using rivets. (2) - This is also a poor match, as it uses metal rivets instead of natural binding materials.
5. An ancient Egyptian spear with a stone tip lashed to a wooden shaft using animal sinew. (8) - This is a good match, as it uses a natural binding material (animal sinew) to attach the stone tip to the wooden shaft.
6. A steel axe with a handle secured by a metal wedge. (3) - This is a moderately poor match, as it uses a metal wedge instead of natural binding materials.
7. A modern composite bow with limbs attached using epoxy resin. (1) - This is a very poor match, as it uses epoxy resin, which is not a natural binding material.
8. A metal chisel with a handle secured by a ferrule. (2) - This is a slightly better match than some of the other examples, but still quite poor because it uses a metal ferrule instead of natural binding materials.
