Explanation:

1. Photovoltaic systems that store energy in batteries (1/10): This candidate does not match the specific theme as it involves converting sunlight directly into electricity, not leveraging natural temperature or wind cycles.
2. Hydroelectric dams that use the flow of rivers (8/10): This candidate closely matches the specific theme, as it involves harnessing the natural cycles of water flow, similar to ocean tides used to generate electricity.
3. Solar thermal energy systems that use the daily cycle of sunlight to heat water (2/10): This candidate does not match the specific theme, as it involves converting sunlight directly into heat, not leveraging natural temperature or wind cycles.
4. Wave energy converters that harness the motion of surface waves (6/10): This candidate partially matches the specific theme, as it involves harnessing the natural motion of water, similar to ocean tides used to generate electricity. However, it does not involve temperature or wind cycles.
5. Solar-powered irrigation systems (1/10): This candidate does not match the specific theme, as it involves converting sunlight directly into energy for irrigation, not leveraging natural temperature or wind cycles.
6. Geothermal power plants that use steam from the Earth's crust (9/10): This candidate closely matches the specific theme, as it involves leveraging the Earth's constant temperature cycles to generate electricity, similar to geothermal heat pumps.
7. Windmills used for grinding grain (0/10): This candidate does not match the specific theme, as it involves using wind power for mechanical energy, not for generating electricity or leveraging natural temperature cycles.
8. Small-scale hydroelectric systems in remote areas (8/10): This candidate closely matches the specific theme, as it involves harnessing the natural cycles of water flow, similar to hydroelectric dams that use the flow of rivers.
