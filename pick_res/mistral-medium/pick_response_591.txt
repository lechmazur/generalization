Explanation:

1. Coal chute (5): While not explicitly pneumatic, it is a system for conveying granular materials, similar to the examples given.
2. Roller conveyor (1): This is a completely different type of conveyance system, relying on rollers rather than air pressure or vacuum.
3. Bucket elevator (2): This system uses buckets attached to a belt or chain to move materials vertically, which is somewhat similar to the pneumatic systems in that it is used for bulk material handling, but it is not a pneumatic or vacuum-powered system.
4. Industrial flour transfer pipeline (8): This is a very close match to the theme, as it is a pneumatic system used for transporting a granular material (flour).
5. Chain conveyor (1): This system uses a chain to pull materials along a track, which is not related to the theme of pneumatic or vacuum-powered conveyance.
6. Screw conveyor (6): This system uses a rotating screw to move materials through a tube, which is somewhat similar to the pneumatic systems in that it is used for bulk material handling and can be enclosed, but it is not a pneumatic or vacuum-powered system.
7. Belt conveyor system (1): This system uses a belt to move materials along a track, which is not related to the theme of pneumatic or vacuum-powered conveyance.
8. Gravity chute (1): This system relies on gravity to move materials down a chute, which is not related to the theme of pneumatic or vacuum-powered conveyance.
