Explanation:

1. Drawbridge (2/10): A drawbridge has some similarities to the theme as it acts as a barrier and can control the flow of things, but it does not have the selective permeability aspect that is key to the theme.
2. Pipeline (6/10): A pipeline is used to transport fluids, similar to the cell membrane and dialysis machine. However, it does not have the filtration or selective permeability aspect of the theme.
3. Air filter (5/10): An air filter has some aspects of the theme, as it filters out particles from the air, similar to the kidney filtering waste from blood. However, it does not have the biological or selective permeability aspect of the theme.
4. Door (1/10): A door does not match the theme, as it is not selectively permeable and does not filter or transport substances.
5. Window (1/10): A window does not match the theme, as it is not selectively permeable and does not filter or transport substances.
6. Canal (7/10): A canal is used to transport water, similar to the cell membrane and dialysis machine. It also has some selective permeability, as it can control the flow of water and prevent the passage of certain substances.
7. Tunnel (7/10): A tunnel is used to transport substances, similar to the cell membrane and dialysis machine. It also has some selective permeability, as it can control the flow of substances and prevent the passage of certain objects.
8. Gate (2/10): A gate has some similarities to the theme as it acts as a barrier and can control the flow of things, but it does not have the selective permeability aspect that is key to the theme.
