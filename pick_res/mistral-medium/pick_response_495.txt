Explanation:

1. A space heater does not match the theme of passive solar heating and cooling systems. (score: 0)
2. A heat pump can be used for both heating and cooling, but it is not a passive system like the examples given. However, it does transfer heat using a refrigeration cycle, which is somewhat related to the thermal labyrinth concept. (score: 5)
3. A refrigerator actively cools an enclosed space by removing heat, which is the opposite of the theme. (score: 1)
4. A heat gun is used to apply direct heat to a specific area or object, and it does not match the theme of passive solar heating and cooling systems. (score: 0)
5. A convection oven uses a fan to circulate hot air for more even cooking, but it does not match the theme of passive solar heating and cooling systems. (score: 2)
6. A heat exchanger transfers heat between two fluids without them mixing, which is somewhat related to the double-skin facade and thermal labyrinth concepts. (score: 6)
7. A trombe wall is a passive solar heating system that absorbs and stores solar energy during the day and releases it at night, making it a strong match for the theme. (score: 8)
8. A fireplace is used to provide heat by burning fuel, which is not related to the theme of passive solar heating and cooling systems. (score: 0)
