Explanation:

1. Passive solar greenhouse (score 8): This is a structure that uses natural insulation and solar energy to maintain a comfortable temperature, similar to the straw bale house and Earthship home examples.
2. Air-conditioned office building (score 1): This is a structure that relies on mechanical systems to maintain a comfortable temperature, making it a poor match for the theme of natural insulation and temperature regulation.
3. Sauna with electric heater (score 2): While this structure does use insulation to retain heat, it relies on an electric heater rather than natural insulation or temperature regulation, making it a poor match for the theme.
4. Hot tub with electric heater (score 3): Like the sauna, this structure uses insulation to retain heat, but relies on an electric heater rather than natural insulation or temperature regulation. However, it is closer to the theme than the air-conditioned office building or space heater.
5. Space heater (score 1): This is a portable device that relies on electricity to generate heat, making it a poor match for the theme of natural insulation and temperature regulation.
6. Airplane cabin (score 1): This is a structure that relies on mechanical systems to maintain a comfortable temperature, making it a poor match for the theme of natural insulation and temperature regulation.
7. Electric car with climate control (score 1): This is a vehicle that relies on mechanical systems to maintain a comfortable temperature, making it a poor match for the theme of natural insulation and temperature regulation.
8. Heated swimming pool (score 4): While this structure does rely on a mechanical system to maintain a comfortable temperature, it is closer to the theme than the air-conditioned office building or space heater because it uses insulation to retain heat and is a more permanent structure.
