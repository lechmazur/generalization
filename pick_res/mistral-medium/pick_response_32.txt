Explanation:

1. Aluminum can recycling program (score: 2) - This candidate involves recycling, but it does not involve a closed-loop system or transformation of waste into a resource within a single environment.
2. Bioremediation bioreactor (score: 2) - This candidate involves the use of bacteria to break down pollutants, but it does not involve a closed-loop system or transformation of waste into a resource within a single environment.
3. Closed-loop industrial process (score: 8) - This candidate involves a closed-loop system and the transformation of byproducts into raw materials within a single facility, making it a strong match for the specific theme.
4. Industrial waste heat recovery (score: 1) - This candidate involves the use of waste heat, but it does not involve a closed-loop system or transformation of waste into a resource within a single environment.
5. Landfill gas recovery system (score: 5) - This candidate involves the capture of methane from decomposing waste for energy production, which is similar to the anaerobic digester example. However, it does not involve a closed-loop system or transformation of waste into a resource within a single environment.
6. Recycling center (score: 2) - This candidate involves the sorting and processing of various materials, but it does not involve a closed-loop system or transformation of waste into a resource within a single environment.
7. Biomass power plant (score: 0) - This candidate involves the burning of wood chips for energy production, but it does not involve a closed-loop system or transformation of waste into a resource within a single environment.
8. Municipal composting program (score: 3) - This candidate involves the collection and processing of food waste into compost, which is similar to the composting toilet example. However, it does not involve a closed-loop system or transformation of waste into a resource within a single environment.
