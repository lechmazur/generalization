Explanation:

1. A Lego structure built from interlocking plastic bricks. (2/10) - While this example does involve interlocking components, they are not tetrahedra.
2. A honeycomb structure composed of hexagonal cells. (1/10) - This example does not involve tetrahedra at all.
3. A geodesic dome constructed from triangular panels. (1/10) - This example does not involve tetrahedra.
4. A modular shelving unit made from interlocking components. (5/10) - Although this example involves interlocking components, it is not specified that they are tetrahedra or that each component connects to at least three others.
5. A modular building system using interlocking blocks. (8/10) - This example comes close to matching the theme, as it involves interlocking components. However, it is not specified that they are tetrahedra or that each component connects to at least three others.
6. A mathematical model demonstrating the properties of space-filling using a pattern of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron shares at least three faces with adjacent tetrahedra. (9/10) - This example closely matches the theme, as it involves interlocking tetrahedra that share at least three faces with adjacent tetrahedra.
7. A tessellation pattern on a flat surface using interlocking shapes. (2/10) - This example does not involve three-dimensional structures or tetrahedra.
8. A crystal lattice structure where atoms are arranged in a repeating pattern. (1/10) - This example does not involve interlocking tetrahedra.
