Explanation:

1. Identifying subtle changes in water turbidity caused by bottom-feeding fish stirring up sediment. (2) - This candidate is somewhat related to the theme as it involves observing environmental changes to locate fish, but it does not specifically involve recognizing insect hatches, bird flocks, or marine mammal movements.
2. Analyzing stomach contents of caught fish to understand their dietary preferences. (1) - This candidate is not directly related to the theme, as it does not involve observing environmental cues or animal behavior to locate fish.
3. Employing longline fishing with hundreds of baited hooks to catch pelagic fish. (0) - This candidate is not related to the theme, as it does not involve recognizing insect hatches, bird flocks, or marine mammal movements to locate fish.
4. Using underwater cameras to observe fish behavior and distribution. (6) - This candidate is moderately related to the theme, as it involves observing fish behavior to locate them. However, it does not specifically involve recognizing insect hatches, bird flocks, or marine mammal movements.
5. Jigging with artificial lures to mimic the movements of prey fish. (0) - This candidate is not related to the theme, as it does not involve recognizing insect hatches, bird flocks, or marine mammal movements to locate fish.
6. Applying mathematical models to predict fish stock abundance and distribution. (0) - This candidate is not related to the theme, as it does not involve recognizing insect hatches, bird flocks, or marine mammal movements to locate fish.
7. Using fish finders to identify water temperature and depth preferences of target species. (1) - This candidate is somewhat related to the theme, as it involves using technology to locate fish. However, it does not specifically involve recognizing insect hatches, bird flocks, or marine mammal movements.
8. Using chum to create a feeding frenzy and attract fish to a specific location. (5) - This candidate is moderately related to the theme, as it involves using environmental cues (chum) to attract fish. However, it does not specifically involve recognizing insect hatches, bird flocks, or marine mammal movements.
