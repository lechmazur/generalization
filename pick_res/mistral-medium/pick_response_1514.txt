Explanation:

1. LED screens that display changing patterns of light and color (1/10) - This candidate does not match the specific theme as it involves artificial light and technology, rather than bioluminescence or refraction in marine animals.
2. Certain species of jellyfish that display iridescent colors when they move through the water (6/10) - While this candidate does involve marine animals displaying changing colors, it is not specifically about bioluminescence or refraction, so it is not a perfect match for the theme.
3. Holographic stickers that change appearance with angle of view (2/10) - This candidate does not match the specific theme as it involves artificial holograms, rather than bioluminescence or refraction in marine animals.
4. Kaleidoscopes that create shifting patterns of color when turned (5/10) - While this candidate does involve shifting patterns of color, it is not specifically about bioluminescence or refraction in marine animals, so it is not a perfect match for the theme.
5. Oil slicks on water that create shifting patterns of color (4/10) - While this candidate does involve shifting patterns of color, it is not specifically about bioluminescence or refraction in marine animals, so it is not a perfect match for the theme.
6. Auroras that display shifting patterns of light in the sky (0/10) - This candidate does not match the specific theme as it involves natural light displays in the sky, rather than bioluminescence or refraction in marine animals.
7. Prism glasses that split light into colorful patterns (3/10) - While this candidate does involve refraction of light, it is not specifically about bioluminescence or marine animals, so it is not a perfect match for the theme.
8. Soap bubbles that create rainbow patterns when they move (8/10) - While this candidate does not involve marine animals, it does involve refraction of light to create shifting patterns of color, which is similar to the theme of bioluminescence and refraction in marine animals.
