Explanation:

1. A magnetic storm is caused by solar activity, not by the Earth itself, so it's a weak match for the theme of natural disasters caused by geological activity. (Score: 2)
2. A geyser eruption is a result of geothermal activity, which is similar to volcanic eruptions, so it's a strong match for the theme. (Score: 9)
3. Glacier calving is when a large piece of ice breaks off from a glacier and falls into the water. While it's related to geological activity, it's not as violent or sudden as the examples in the theme, so it's a weak match. (Score: 2)
4. A thunderstorm can include lightning strikes, so it's a decent match for the theme, but it's not a perfect match since thunderstorms can also involve other weather phenomena like heavy rain and strong winds. (Score: 6)
5. A hailstorm involves precipitation in the form of hail, which is not directly related to the theme of geological activity, so it's a weak match. (Score: 5)
6. A forest fire is not caused by geological activity, so it's a poor match for the theme. (Score: 1)
7. A tidal wave is caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, not by geological activity, so it's a poor match for the theme. (Score: 1)
8. A tsunami is caused by an underwater earthquake or volcanic eruption, so it's a strong match for the theme. (Score: 8)
