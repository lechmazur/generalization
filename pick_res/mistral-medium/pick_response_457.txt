Explanation:

1. Voronoi diagrams in natural cell formations (score: 4) - This pattern is similar to the honeycomb structure in beehives, but it does not perfectly match the theme of spiral patterns or tessellated pavement.
2. A coral reef structure (score: 6) - Coral reefs often have a branching or network-like structure, which is somewhat similar to the honeycomb structure in beehives. However, it does not exhibit the spiral patterns found in sunflower seeds or the tessellated pavement in rock formations.
3. A galaxy spiral (score: 1) - Although this example contains spirals, it does not match the specific theme of spiral patterns in sunflower seed arrangements, honeycomb structures in beehives, or tessellated pavement in rock formations.
4. A nautilus shell (score: 2) - The nautilus shell exhibits a spiral pattern, but it is not similar to the honeycomb structure in beehives or the tessellated pavement in rock formations.
5. A river delta (score: 5) - River deltas can form intricate patterns that resemble the tessellated pavement in rock formations. However, they do not exhibit the spiral patterns found in sunflower seeds or the honeycomb structure in beehives.
6. A mosaic tile floor (score: 0) - This example does not match the specific theme, as it does not contain spiral patterns, honeycomb structures, or tessellated pavement.
7. A fractal tree (score: 0) - This example does not match the specific theme, as it does not contain spiral patterns, honeycomb structures, or tessellated pavement.
8. A chessboard (score: 8) - The chessboard pattern closely resembles the tessellated pavement in rock formations and the honeycomb structure in beehives. However, it does not exhibit the spiral patterns found in sunflower seeds.
