Explanation:

1. Black Holes - Score 1: They are not pulsars, helium, or Neptune. They are a type of astronomical object like pulsars and Neptune, but they do not share the specific theme.
2. TRAPPIST-1e - Score 8: It is an exoplanet, like Neptune, but it is not a pulsar or helium. It is closer to the theme than black holes or neutrinos, but it is not an exact match.
3. Neutron Stars - Score 9: They are similar to pulsars, as some pulsars are neutron stars. However, they are not helium or Neptune, so they are not an exact match.
4. Neutrinos - Score 0: They are elementary particles, not astronomical objects like pulsars, helium, or Neptune. They do not share the specific theme.
5. Proxima Centauri b - Score 8: It is an exoplanet, like Neptune, but it is not a pulsar or helium. It is closer to the theme than black holes or neutrinos, but it is not an exact match.
6. Exoplanets - Score 8: This category includes Neptune-like planets, but it also includes a wide variety of other planets that do not share the specific theme.
7. Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation - Score 2: It is a form of electromagnetic radiation, not an astronomical object like pulsars or Neptune, or an element like helium. It does not share the specific theme.
8. Quasars - Score 2: They are extremely luminous active galactic nuclei, not pulsars, helium, or Neptune. They do not share the specific theme.
