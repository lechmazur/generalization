Explanation:

1. Card catalog - This is a system used for organizing and storing information about library materials, not a system used for purifying water, refining oil, or making espresso. (1)
2. Conveyor belt - While conveyor belts can be used in water purification systems, oil refineries, and espresso machines, they are not specific to these systems and can be used in many other applications. (5)
3. Tool box - A tool box is used for storing and organizing tools, not for purifying water, refining oil, or making espresso. (0)
4. Assembly line - An assembly line is a manufacturing process in which parts are added to a product in a sequential manner to create a finished product. While this process can be used in the production of water purification systems, oil refineries, and espresso machines, it is not specific to these systems and can be used in many other applications. (6)
5. Bookshelf - A bookshelf is used for storing and organizing books, not for purifying water, refining oil, or making espresso. (0)

Note: The scores are based on how well the candidates match the specific theme of water purification systems, oil refineries, and espresso machines, and not on how well they match a broader or related theme. The scores are also not based on how essential the candidates are to the functioning of the systems, but rather on how closely they match the theme. For example, a conveyor belt may be essential to the functioning of an assembly line, but it is not specific to the theme of water purification systems, oil refineries, and espresso machines, so it receives a score of 5.
