Explanation:

1. Jeff Koons (4): While Koons is an influential artist like Warhol, his work doesn't involve the same level of self-expression and transformation as the examples in the theme.
2. Grace Jones (8): Jones embodies the theme well with her androgynous appearance, bold fashion choices, and musical career, similar to Bowie and RuPaul.
3. Prince (9): Prince's flamboyant stage presence, gender-bending fashion, and musical genius make him a strong match for the theme.
4. John Waters (2): Although Waters is a cult filmmaker known for his eccentric style, his work doesn't involve the same level of self-transformation and musical expression as the examples in the theme.
5. Salvador Dali (1): Dali was a surrealist artist, but his work and persona don't align closely with the theme of transformative self-expression and musical talent.
6. Jean-Michel Basquiat (6): Basquiat was an influential artist who collaborated with musicians, but his work and persona don't fully embody the theme of transformative self-expression and musical talent.
7. Boy George (6): Boy George's androgynous appearance and musical career make him a decent match for the theme, but not as strong as some other candidates.
8. Lady Gaga (10): Lady Gaga embodies the theme perfectly with her ever-changing appearance, bold fashion choices, and successful musical career, similar to Bowie, RuPaul, and Warhol.
