Explanation:

1. GPS (Global Positioning System) - Score 2: While it is a technology that has revolutionized navigation and transportation, it does not involve a physical mechanism like a wheel or a press, nor does it involve a biological process like penicillin.
2. Computer - Score 1: A computer is a complex electronic device that processes and stores data. It does not fit the theme of simple mechanical inventions or biological discoveries.
3. Pacemaker - Score 6: A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted in the chest to help regulate the heartbeat. While it is not a simple mechanical invention like a wheel or a press, it does involve a physical mechanism that is used to improve a biological process, similar to penicillin.
4. Laser - Score 5: A laser is a device that emits a narrow, intense beam of light. While it is not a simple mechanical invention like a wheel or a press, it does involve a physical mechanism that is used to perform a specific function, similar to the printing press.
5. Telephone - Score 8: A telephone is a device that allows people to communicate over long distances by transmitting sound waves. While it is not a simple mechanical invention like a wheel or a press, it does involve a physical mechanism that is used to perform a specific function, similar to the printing press.
6. Radio - Score 7: A radio is a device that receives and transmits radio waves, allowing people to listen to music, news, and other programming. While it is not a simple mechanical invention like a wheel or a press, it does involve a physical mechanism that is used to perform a specific function, similar to the printing press.
7. Internet - Score 1: The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that allows people to access and share information. While it is a revolutionary technology, it does not fit the theme of simple mechanical inventions or biological discoveries.
8. Combustion engine - Score 3: A combustion engine is a machine that converts chemical energy into mechanical energy by burning fuel. While it is a mechanical invention, it does not fit the theme of simple inventions like a wheel or a press, nor does it involve a biological process like penicillin.
