Explanation:

1. Ophiuroidea (brittle stars) are echinoderms like starfish (Asteroidea), but they belong to a different class. They have a central disk and five slender, flexible arms, unlike the examples given which are all jellyfish. Score: 2
2. Tunicata (sea squirts) are not closely related to jellyfish or starfish. They are chordates, like humans, in their larval stage, but as adults they are sessile filter feeders. Score: 1
3. Asteroidea (starfish) are closely related to the examples given, as they are also in the phylum Cnidaria and have a similar body plan with radial symmetry. However, they are not jellyfish. Score: 8
4. Cnidaria is the phylum that includes jellyfish, as well as other animals like corals and anemones. All of the examples given are in this phylum, so any other member of this phylum would be a good match. Score: 9
5. Thaliacea (salps and doliolids) are not closely related to jellyfish. They are in the phylum Chordata, like humans, and have a notochord (a flexible rod) in their larval stage. Score: 0
6. Appendicularia (larvaceans) are also in the phylum Chordata, but they are not closely related to jellyfish. They are small, transparent animals that live in the open ocean and build elaborate mucus houses to filter food from the water. Score: 0
7. Ctenophora (comb jellies) are sometimes mistaken for jellyfish, but they are in a separate phylum. They have eight rows of cilia (tiny hairs) that they use to swim, and they lack the stinging cells (nematocysts) that are characteristic of jellyfish. Score: 0
8. Pelagia noctiluca is a species of jellyfish in the phylum Cnidaria, like the examples given. It is also known as the mauve stinger. Score: 9
