Seamus Heaney's "Bogland" poems (score: 6) - The poems explore the connection between the bog and the collective memory of the Irish people, which is somewhat related to the theme of personal or communal memories tied to the bog. However, it does not directly involve characters rediscovering forgotten memories or confronting family secrets.
2. A play about the impact of industrial development on a wetland ecosystem (score: 2) - While this example touches on the broader theme of human interaction with bogs, it does not involve the specific theme of personal memories or family secrets being rediscovered or confronted.
