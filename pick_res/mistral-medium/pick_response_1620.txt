Explanation:

1. Mechanical calculator (score: 8) - This is a strong match for the specific theme as it is a mechanical device used for calculations, similar to the IBM 601 multiplying punch, BTM Type 3 statistical machine, and Hollerith tabulating machine.
2. Watson supercomputer (score: 1) - This is a poor match for the specific theme as it is an electronic, programmable computer that is capable of performing complex calculations and data analysis, unlike the examples in the theme.
3. ENIAC (score: 6) - This is a moderate match for the specific theme as it is an electronic, programmable computer that was used for calculations during World War II. However, it was not specifically designed for statistical analysis or data tabulation like the examples in the theme.
4. Stock ticker (score: 5) - This is a moderate match for the specific theme as it is a mechanical device that was used to transmit and display stock prices. While it is not specifically designed for calculations or data analysis, it does share some similarities with the examples in the theme.
5. Mechanical adding machine (score: 7) - This is a strong match for the specific theme as it is a mechanical device used for calculations, similar to the IBM 601 multiplying punch, BTM Type 3 statistical machine, and Hollerith tabulating machine.
6. Difference engine (score: 2) - This is a weak match for the specific theme as it is a mechanical device used for calculating mathematical tables. While it is a mechanical device used for calculations, it is not specifically designed for statistical analysis or data tabulation like the examples in the theme.
7. Modern predictive analytics software (score: 1) - This is a poor match for the specific theme as it is a software program used for data analysis and predictive modeling. Unlike the examples in the theme, it is not a mechanical device.
8. Powers-Samas punched card machines (score: 9) - This is a very strong match for the specific theme as it is a mechanical device used for data tabulation and statistical analysis, similar to the Hollerith tabulating machine.
