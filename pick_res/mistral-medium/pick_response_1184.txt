Explanation:

1. The collapse of the Aral Sea ecosystem following the diversion of rivers for irrigation projects (score 8): This example closely matches the specific theme of sudden and catastrophic environmental changes due to human activities or natural disasters.
2. The gradual buildup of sediment in river deltas (score 1): Although this example involves environmental change, it does not fit the specific theme because the change is gradual and not sudden or catastrophic.
3. The slow adaptation of species through natural selection (score 0): This example does not fit the specific theme because it involves a slow and ongoing process rather than a sudden and catastrophic event.
4. The slow recovery of a forest after a wildfire (score 2): This example involves a natural disaster (a wildfire) that causes sudden and catastrophic environmental change, but the focus is on the gradual recovery process rather than the initial event.
5. The slow rusting of iron when exposed to moisture (score 1): This example does not fit the specific theme because it involves a gradual and ongoing process rather than a sudden and catastrophic event.
6. The slow desertification of certain regions due to climate change (score 5): This example involves environmental change due to human activities (climate change), but the change is gradual rather than sudden and catastrophic. However, the severity and irreversibility of desertification make it a closer match to the specific theme than some of the other examples.
7. The gradual urbanization of rural areas (score 1): This example does not fit the specific theme because it involves a gradual and ongoing process rather than a sudden and catastrophic event.
8. The gradual increase in global temperatures due to climate change (score 6): This example involves environmental change due to human activities (climate change), but the change is gradual rather than sudden and catastrophic. However, the severity and irreversibility of global temperature increases make it a closer match to the specific theme than some of the other examples.
