Explanation:

1. E-waste processing plant (5): This candidate involves converting waste into a useful product, but it does not involve the specific theme of converting waste to fuel or energy through gasification, pyrolysis, or biorefining.
2. Anaerobic digester converting food waste to methane gas (8): This candidate closely matches the specific theme, as it involves converting waste into a fuel (methane gas) through a biological process (anaerobic digestion).
3. Recycling sorting facility (1): This candidate does not match the specific theme, as it does not involve converting waste into fuel or energy.
4. Oil refinery (0): This candidate does not match the specific theme, as it does not involve converting waste into fuel or energy.
5. Material recovery facility (2): This candidate does not fully match the specific theme, but it does involve processing waste to recover valuable materials, which is somewhat related.
6. Plastic recycling machine (1): This candidate does not match the specific theme, as it does not involve converting waste into fuel or energy.
7. Scrap metal smelter (0): This candidate does not match the specific theme, as it does not involve converting waste into fuel or energy.
8. Waste incinerator (4): This candidate partially matches the specific theme, as it involves converting waste into energy (heat and electricity) through combustion. However, it does not involve gasification, pyrolysis, or biorefining.
