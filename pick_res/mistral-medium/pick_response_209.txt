Explanation:

1. A set of stone chimes - Score 5: While not made of wood or bamboo, stone chimes are similar to the theme in that they are a percussion instrument made from a natural material.
2. A tin whistle - Score 1: This instrument does not match the theme, as it is not a percussion instrument and is made of metal.
3. A steel drum - Score 1: Like the tin whistle, this instrument does not match the theme, as it is a percussion instrument made of metal.
4. A rubber bongo - Score 6: Although not made of wood or bamboo, the bongo is a percussion instrument similar to the theme. The use of rubber instead of a natural material lowers the score.
5. A synthetic drum - Score 2: This instrument does not match the theme, as it is a percussion instrument made of synthetic materials.
6. A nylon-string guitar - Score 8: While not a percussion instrument, the nylon-string guitar is similar to the theme in that it is a musical instrument made from a non-metallic material.
7. A glass harmonica - Score 9: This instrument closely matches the theme, as it is a percussion instrument made from a natural material (glass).
8. A plastic recorder - Score 4: Although this instrument is not a percussion instrument, it is made from a non-metallic material, which gives it some similarity to the theme. However, the use of plastic instead of a natural material lowers the score.
