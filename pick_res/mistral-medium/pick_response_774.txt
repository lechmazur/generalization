Explanation:

1. Smart lighting systems that adjust brightness based on ambient light - Score 2: This candidate is somewhat related to the theme as it involves a response to environmental changes, but it does not involve the specific theme of materials changing their properties in response to stimuli.
2. Smart grids that balance electricity distribution based on demand - Score 1: This candidate is not related to the theme as it does not involve materials changing their properties in response to stimuli.
3. Climate control systems that adjust based on external weather - Score 2: This candidate is somewhat related to the theme as it involves a response to environmental changes, but it does not involve the specific theme of materials changing their properties in response to stimuli.
4. Robots that modify their actions based on sensor input - Score 5: This candidate is moderately related to the theme as it involves a response to stimuli, but it does not involve the specific theme of materials changing their properties in response to stimuli.
5. Smartphones that adapt their interface based on user behavior - Score 1: This candidate is not related to the theme as it does not involve materials changing their properties in response to stimuli.
6. Shape-memory alloys that change their configuration in response to temperature changes - Score 8: This candidate is closely related to the theme as it involves materials changing their properties (shape) in response to stimuli (temperature changes).
7. Autonomous vehicles that alter routes based on traffic conditions - Score 6: This candidate is moderately related to the theme as it involves a response to stimuli, but it does not involve the specific theme of materials changing their properties in response to stimuli.
8. Home security systems that change alert levels based on detected activity - Score 3: This candidate is somewhat related to the theme as it involves a response to stimuli, but it does not involve the specific theme of materials changing their properties in response to stimuli.
