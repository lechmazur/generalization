Explanation:

1. The nautilus shell - 2/10: Although it has a spiral pattern, it does not have a helical form like the examples.
2. A circular staircase - 0/10: This does not have a helical form, it is just a circle with steps.
3. The pattern of a pinecone - 1/10: While there is a spiral pattern, it is not a continuous helix like the examples.
4. A winding river - 1/10: This has a winding path, but it does not have a helical form.
5. The shape of a hurricane - 6/10: This has a helical form in its wind patterns, making it a decent match to the theme.
6. The shape of a galaxy - 2/10: While galaxies can have a spiral shape, they do not have a helical form like the examples.
7. The Fibonacci sequence - 0/10: This is a mathematical sequence and does not have a physical form that can be compared to the theme.
8. A coiled rope - 5/10: This has a helical form, but it is a single strand and not a double helix like the DNA example.
