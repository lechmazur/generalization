Explanation:

1. Rubber tire - 1/10: This candidate does not match the theme of solid materials shaped by casting or molding, as rubber tires are typically made through a process of vulcanization and extrusion.
2. Concrete block - 6/10: While concrete is cast into a specific shape, it is not a metal, so it only partially fits the theme.
3. Glass window pane - 8/10: This candidate closely matches the theme, as it is made of glass and formed by a process involving heating and molding.
4. Steel beam - 7/10: This candidate is a solid material that is often cast or molded, but it is not bronze, glass, or cast iron, so it only partially fits the theme.
5. Stone sculpture - 5/10: Stone sculptures are created by carving or chiseling, not casting or molding, so they only partially fit the theme.
6. Copper wire - 9/10: This candidate closely matches the theme, as it is made of a metal (copper) and formed by a process involving heating and molding.
7. Porcelain dish - 2/10: While porcelain is a type of ceramic, it is not a metal, so it does not fit the theme well.
8. Ceramic vase - 3/10: This candidate is made of a material that is fired in a kiln, but it is not a metal, so it only partially fits the theme.
