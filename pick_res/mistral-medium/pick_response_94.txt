Explanation:

1. Water levels in reservoirs fluctuating due to rainfall (2/10) - This candidate has some connection to the theme as it involves natural cycles, but it does not involve the organism itself undergoing a cycle of dormancy and regrowth.
2. Coral reefs undergoing bleaching during warmer periods and recovering during cooler periods (6/10) - This candidate is a closer match to the theme as it involves an organism (coral) undergoing a cycle of dormancy (bleaching) and regrowth (recovery). However, it is not a perfect match as the cycle is triggered by temperature changes rather than seasonal changes.
3. Fluctuations in wildlife populations due to predation (1/10) - This candidate does not match the theme as it does not involve a cycle of dormancy and regrowth.
4. Tides rising and falling daily (1/10) - This candidate does not match the theme as it does not involve an organism undergoing a cycle of dormancy and regrowth.
5. Weather patterns influenced by climate change (2/10) - This candidate has some connection to the theme as it involves natural cycles, but it does not involve an organism undergoing a cycle of dormancy and regrowth.
6. Day and night cycles (9/10) - This candidate is a close match to the theme as it involves a natural cycle that is driven by external factors (the rotation of the Earth). However, it is not a perfect match as it does not involve an organism undergoing a cycle of dormancy and regrowth.
7. Annual cycles of tourism in coastal areas (8/10) - This candidate is a close match to the theme as it involves a cycle that is driven by seasonal changes. However, it is not a perfect match as it does not involve an organism undergoing a cycle of dormancy and regrowth.
8. Changes in ocean currents (3/10) - This candidate has some connection to the theme as it involves natural cycles, but it does not involve an organism undergoing a cycle of dormancy and regrowth.
