Explanation:

1. Collages made from overlapping images (score: 1) - This candidate does not change the image based on viewing angle or require a special way of looking at it, so it is a poor match for the theme.
2. Scientific diagrams with labeled layers (score: 2) - While this candidate does involve layers, it does not change the image based on viewing angle or require a special way of looking at it, so it is a weak match for the theme.
3. Holographic art pieces that display different images depending on the light source and angle (score: 8) - This candidate is a strong match for the theme, as it changes the image based on the viewing angle and light source.
4. 3D printed objects with internal structures (score: 4) - While this candidate does involve internal structures, it does not change the image based on viewing angle or require a special way of looking at it, so it is a moderate match for the theme.
5. Landscape paintings showing depth through layering (score: 1) - This candidate does involve layers, but it does not change the image based on viewing angle or require a special way of looking at it, so it is a poor match for the theme.
6. Geological strata visible in cliff faces (score: 5) - While this candidate does involve layers and structures, it does not change the image based on viewing angle or require a special way of looking at it, so it is a moderate match for the theme.
7. Photographs with multiple exposures (score: 3) - This candidate does involve multiple images, but it does not change the image based on viewing angle or require a special way of looking at it, so it is a weak match for the theme.
8. Virtual reality environments with multiple layers of interaction (score: 2) - While this candidate does involve layers and interaction, it does not change the image based on viewing angle or require a special way of looking at it, so it is a weak match for the theme.
