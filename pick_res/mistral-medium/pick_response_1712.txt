Explanation:

1. A small wind-powered water desalination unit (1) is not a large structure designed to capture wind currents at high altitudes, so it scores low (1).
2. A hydroelectric dam (2) does not use wind energy, so it scores 0.
3. A geothermal power plant (3) does not use wind energy, so it scores 0.
4. A tidal energy generator (4) does not use wind energy, so it scores 0.
5. A kite-based wind energy system (5) is an innovative way to capture wind energy, but it does not involve a structure over 100 feet tall, so it scores 2.
6. A wave energy converter (6) does not use wind energy, so it scores 0.
7. A small-scale residential wind turbine (7) is not over 100 feet tall, so it scores 1.
8. A skyscraper-integrated wind funnel system (8) channels natural breezes to power internal turbines and could potentially be over 100 feet tall, so it scores 8.

Note: The scores are based on how well the candidates match the specific theme of large wind energy structures over 100 feet tall, and not on their overall effectiveness or environmental impact as energy sources.
