5. A subway system (0/10): This is a transportation system for humans and is not related to the lymphatic system, the carbon cycle, or a coral reef ecosystem.
6. A recycling plant (1/10): This is a facility that processes recyclable materials and is not directly related to the lymphatic system, the carbon cycle, or a coral reef ecosystem.
