Explanation:

1. A stained glass window is made up of many pieces, but it is not meant to be disassembled and reassembled like a jigsaw puzzle or a piñata. It is more like a mosaic, which is an anti-example. (2/10)
2. A tapestry is a woven piece of fabric, not something that is meant to be taken apart and put back together. It is more like a quilt or a collage, which are anti-examples. (2/10)
3. A fractal pattern is a repeating geometric pattern that is not meant to be disassembled and reassembled. It does not fit the theme of a jigsaw puzzle, wishbone, or piñata. (1/10)
4. A constellation is a group of stars that form a pattern in the sky. While it is not something that is meant to be disassembled and reassembled, it does fit the theme of a pattern or design that is made up of individual pieces. (6/10)
5. A patchwork blanket is made up of many different pieces of fabric sewn together. While it is not meant to be disassembled and reassembled like a jigsaw puzzle or a piñata, it does fit the theme of a design made up of individual pieces. (5/10)

7. A kaleidoscope is a tube with mirrors and colored pieces of glass or plastic that create patterns when the tube is rotated. While it is not meant to be disassembled and reassembled like a jigsaw puzzle or a piñata, it does fit the theme of a design made up of individual pieces. (8/10)
8. A sand mandala is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition in which a design is created using colored sand. Once the design is complete, it is ritually disassembled and the sand is swept away.
