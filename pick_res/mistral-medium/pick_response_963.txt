Explanation:

1. A waterfall is a natural feature where water flows over a steep drop, it does not store or regulate water like the examples in the theme. (1)
2. A rain barrel collects and stores rainwater, but it is not a large-scale structure designed for regulating water supply or pressure like the theme examples. (2)
3. A hydraulic press uses fluid pressure to generate force, but it does not store or regulate water for supply or control purposes. (1)
4. A storm drain is designed to collect and carry away stormwater and melted snow, which makes it somewhat similar to the theme examples as it regulates water flow. (5)
5. A sprinkler system distributes water for irrigation or fire suppression, but it does not store or regulate water supply or pressure on a large scale like the theme examples. (3)
6. A water pipe is used to transport water from one place to another, which is a function shared with the theme examples, but it does not provide the same level of storage or pressure regulation. (6)
7. A river is a natural watercourse that flows towards a sea or an ocean, it does not store or regulate water like the theme examples. (1)
8. A water pump is used to move water from one place to another, and while it can help regulate pressure, it does not provide the same level of storage or large-scale control as the theme examples. (7)
