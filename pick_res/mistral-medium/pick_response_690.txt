Explanation:

1. Lynn Conway - 9/10: Pioneer in computer architecture and microelectronics, known for her work on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design. She is considered one of the most influential women in computing, similar to the examples provided.
2. Kathleen Booth - 6/10: Created the Assembly Language (ARC) and wrote the first assembly language program. While she made significant contributions to computing, her work is not as directly related to the specific theme of compiler development and computer science theory as the examples provided.
3. Ada Lovelace - 2/10: Known for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and considered the world's first computer programmer. However, her contributions predate the specific theme of modern compiler development and computer science theory.
4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller - 8/10: First American woman to earn a Ph.D. in computer science and developed the first computer programming language for the Burroughs Corporation. Her work is closely related to the specific theme of compiler development and computer science theory.
5. Jean Sammet - 7/10: Developed the FORMAC programming language and contributed to the creation of COBOL. Her work on programming languages is related to the specific theme, but not as directly focused on compiler development and computer science theory as the examples provided.
6. Adele Goldberg - 8/10: Known for her work on the Smalltalk programming language and its associated development environment. Her contributions to object-oriented programming and development tools are closely related to the specific theme of compiler development and computer science theory.
7. Mary Allen Wilkes - 9/10: Developed the LINC operating system, one of the earliest personal computer systems. Her work on operating systems and computer architecture is closely related to the specific theme of compiler development and computer science theory.
8. Radia Perlman - 9/10: Known as the "Mother of the Internet," she developed the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for network switches. While her work is not directly related to compiler development, her significant contributions to computer science theory and network architecture make her a strong match for the specific theme.
