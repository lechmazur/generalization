Explanation:

1. A tsunami reshaping a coastline (2/10): While this does involve a natural process changing the landscape over time, it is not a gradual change like the erosion of a mountain range or the growth of a tree's bark.
2. A rock being crushed into sand by machinery (0/10): This is not a natural process and does not involve gradual change over an extended period.
3. A tornado altering a town (1/10): Although this involves a natural process, it is not a gradual change like the examples in the theme.
4. A forest fire altering a landscape (5/10): This is a natural process that can lead to gradual changes in the landscape, but it is not as slow and continuous as the examples in the theme.
5. A tree falling in a storm (2/10): This is a natural event, but it is not a gradual change like the examples in the theme.
6. A river carving a canyon over millennia (9/10): This is a perfect example of the theme, as it involves a natural process causing gradual changes to the landscape over an extended period.
7. A geyser erupting (0/10): This is not a gradual change like the examples in the theme.
8. A volcano erupting (0/10): This is not a gradual change like the examples in the theme.
