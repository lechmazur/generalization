Explanation:

1. Mount Olympus, Greece (2/10): While it is a sacred site in Greek mythology, it does not fit the theme of sacred groves or forests.
2. Machu Picchu, Peru (6/10): Although it is a sacred site, it is not specifically a grove or forest, but rather a complex of buildings and terraces. However, the presence of some vegetation and its spiritual significance make it a moderate match.
3. Notre-Dame Cathedral, France (1/10): This is a religious building, not a sacred grove or forest.
4. Chichen Itza, Mexico (5/10): This ancient Mayan city contains some vegetation, but it is not primarily focused on a sacred grove or forest.
5. Angkor Wat, Cambodia (4/10): This is a temple complex, not a sacred grove or forest, although it does have some vegetation.
6. Hawaiian Sacred Groves, Hawaii (9/10): This is a close match to the theme, as it involves sacred groves with spiritual significance.
7. Mount Fuji, Japan (2/10): While Mount Fuji is a sacred site, it is not a grove or forest.
8. Uluru, Australia (8/10): Uluru is a sacred site with significant spiritual importance, and while it is not a grove, it is a natural land formation surrounded by vegetation, making it a strong match for the theme.
