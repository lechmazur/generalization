Explanation:

1. Echolocation (6): This candidate involves the use of sound waves to determine the location of objects, similar to the way sound waves behave in the examples of the theme. However, it is not a specific location where sound waves naturally accumulate and reverberate.
2. Tornado (1): This candidate does not involve sound waves accumulating and reverberating in a specific location.
3. Sonar (5): This candidate involves the use of sound waves to detect objects underwater, similar to the way sound waves behave in the examples of the theme. However, it is not a specific location where sound waves naturally accumulate and reverberate.
4. Tsunami (1): This candidate does not involve sound waves accumulating and reverberating in a specific location.
5. Hurricane (1): This candidate does not involve sound waves accumulating and reverberating in a specific location.
6. Dog whistle (8): This candidate involves the use of high-frequency sound waves that are not audible to humans but can be heard by dogs. While it is not a specific location where sound waves naturally accumulate and reverberate, it does involve the use of sound waves in a unique way that is similar to the examples of the theme.
7. Earthquake (1): This candidate does not involve sound waves accumulating and reverberating in a specific location.
8. Singing Sand (10): This candidate is a perfect match for the theme, as it involves the natural accumulation and reverberation of sound waves in a specific location, similar to the examples of the theme.
