Explanation:

1. 3D printer (4/10): While not a direct match to the theme of "television, helicopter, ballpoint pen," 3D printers can be considered as a technology that creates physical objects, similar to how a ballpoint pen creates written content on paper. However, the connection is quite loose.
2. Smartphone (8/10): A smartphone has a screen like a television, can have a stylus or touch input like a ballpoint pen, and has various sensors and components that could be loosely associated with a helicopter's control systems. It's a strong match, but not a perfect one.
3. Augmented reality (2/10): Augmented reality does not directly fit the theme, as it is more about overlaying digital information onto the real world, rather than being a standalone technology like the examples given.
4. GPS navigation (6/10): GPS navigation systems share some similarities with the theme, as they involve technology that provides information and guidance, similar to how a television provides visual content or a ballpoint pen allows for written communication. However, the connection is not as strong as with other candidates.
5. Virtual reality headset (1/10): Virtual reality headsets do not fit the theme well, as they are primarily focused on creating immersive, simulated environments, which is quite different from the examples given.
6. Radar (7/10): Radar systems share some similarities with the theme, as they involve technology that provides information and detection, similar to how a television provides visual content or a helicopter uses sensors for navigation. The connection is fairly strong, but not perfect.
7. Drone (6/10): Drones have a strong connection to the theme, as they are similar to helicopters in terms of their aerial capabilities and use of technology for control and navigation. However, they do not share as strong a connection with the "television" and "ballpoint pen" examples.
8. Quantum computing (0/10): Quantum computing does not fit the theme at all, as it is focused on processing information using quantum-mechanical phenomena, which is completely different from the examples given.
