Explanation:

1. Eigenvalue (1/10): Eigenvalues are scalar quantities associated with linear transformations, not topological invariants like the examples.
2. Phase space (2/10): Phase space is a space in which all possible states of a system are represented, not a topological invariant.
3. Wave function (2/10): A wave function describes the quantum state of a system, not a topological invariant.
4. Vector field (5/10): A vector field assigns a vector to every point in a space, which can be related to the winding number of a curve in the field. However, it is not a topological invariant itself.
5. Quantum spin (6/10): Quantum spin is a form of angular momentum, which can be related to the Chern number in the context of topological insulators. However, it is not a topological invariant in general.
6. Periodic orbit (8/10): The Poincar√© map of a periodic orbit can be used to calculate the winding number, making it closely related to the theme.
7. Euler characteristic (1/10): The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant, but it is a global property of a space, unlike the examples which are related to loops or curves in the space.
8. Conservation of energy (0/10): Conservation of energy is a physical law, not a topological invariant.
