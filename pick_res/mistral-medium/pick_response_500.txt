Explanation:

1. A scuba tank is a container filled with compressed gas, usually air or nitrox, which makes it somewhat similar to the examples in the theme. However, it does not involve a hydraulic accumulator, helium-filled shock absorber, or gas spring with carbon dioxide. Score: 6
2. A steam engine uses pressurized steam to generate mechanical work, which is not directly related to the theme. Score: 1
3. A bicycle pump uses air to inflate tires, but it does not involve a hydraulic accumulator, helium-filled shock absorber, or gas spring with carbon dioxide. Score: 5
4. A soccer ball is filled with air or gas, but it does not involve a hydraulic accumulator, helium-filled shock absorber, or gas spring with carbon dioxide. Score: 2
5. A pneumatic drill uses compressed air to power its operation, which is somewhat similar to the theme. Score: 8
6. A compressed natural gas (CNG) storage tank is used to store natural gas at high pressure, which is somewhat similar to the theme. However, it does not involve a hydraulic accumulator, helium-filled shock absorber, or gas spring with carbon dioxide. Score: 4
7. A spring-loaded toy does not involve a hydraulic accumulator, helium-filled shock absorber, or gas spring with carbon dioxide. Score: 0
8. A hydraulic accumulator using oil is very similar to the first example in the theme, which is a hydraulic accumulator using nitrogen. Score: 9
