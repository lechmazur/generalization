4. Diamond Head - 2/10: Although this candidate includes a color-based name, it does not follow the theme of beaches or coasts, but rather a headland or cliff.
5. Opal Beach - 5/10: This candidate follows the theme of color-based names for beaches, but opal is not a metallic color like silver or gold, nor is it a green gemstone like emerald.
6. Ruby Bay - 9/10: This candidate closely matches the theme of color-based names for geographical features, specifically bays, and ruby is a well-known gemstone color.
7. Platinum Point - 8/10: This candidate follows the theme of metallic color-based names for geographical features, specifically points, which is similar to the theme of beaches and coasts.
8. Agate Beach - 4/10: While agate is a type of gemstone, it is not a single, distinct color like silver, gold, or emerald. Agate can come in various colors and patterns, making it less of a direct match to the theme.
