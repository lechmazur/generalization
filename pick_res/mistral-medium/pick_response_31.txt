Explanation:

1. A pH meter measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution, which is not directly related to the specific theme of identifying or quantifying elements or isotopes in a sample. (Score: 2)
2. A device that detects radiation is not related to the specific theme of elemental or isotopic analysis. (Score: 1)
3. A spectrophotometer analyzes the color of a substance, which can provide information about certain properties, but it does not directly identify or quantify elements or isotopes. (Score: 5)
4. Analyzing particle size distribution does not directly relate to the specific theme of elemental or isotopic analysis. (Score: 4)
5. A gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer separates and identifies the chemical components of a volatile liquid sample, which closely matches the specific theme. (Score: 8)
6. A tool that calculates nutritional content based on a database does not involve direct analysis of a sample for elemental or isotopic composition. (Score: 0)
7. A handheld device that measures air quality without analyzing specific substances does not match the specific theme of elemental or isotopic analysis. (Score: 0)
8. A device that detects specific gases in the air can be related to the specific theme, as it involves the identification of certain substances, but it is more limited in scope compared to the examples provided. (Score: 6)
