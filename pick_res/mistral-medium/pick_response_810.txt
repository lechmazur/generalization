Explanation:

1. A worn-out pair of shoes with holes in the soles and frayed laces (8) - This is a strong match for the theme of decay and disintegration, as the shoes are clearly in a state of deterioration.
2. A burning candle (5) - While the candle is undergoing a process of change, it is not necessarily decaying or returning to the earth. However, the wax melting and the wick burning down do have some elements of deterioration.
3. The phases of the moon (2) - This is not a match for the theme, as the moon is not decaying or disintegrating. The phases are simply a result of the moon's orbit around the earth and its position relative to the sun.
4. The changing seasons (2) - Like the phases of the moon, the changing seasons are not a match for the theme. They are a natural cycle of growth, decay, and regeneration, but they do not fit the specific theme of decay and disintegration.
5. A melting ice cube (6) - This is a decent match for the theme, as the ice cube is clearly decaying and returning to its original state of water.
6. An hourglass (7) - This is a strong match for the theme, as the sand in the hourglass is gradually running out and returning to its original state.
7. A caterpillar spinning a cocoon (1) - This is not a match for the theme, as the caterpillar is not decaying or disintegrating. Instead, it is preparing for a transformation into a butterfly.
8. A snake shedding its skin (4) - While this does involve a process of change, it is not necessarily decay or disintegration. The snake is simply shedding its old skin to make way for new growth.
