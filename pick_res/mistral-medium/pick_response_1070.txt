Explanation:

1. A fuse does not match the theme of hydraulic dams, gas cylinders, or pressure cookers, as it does not involve the containment or regulation of pressurized fluids. (0)
2. A pump has some connection to the theme, as it can be used to move and regulate fluids, but it does not inherently involve the containment or pressure build-up like the examples. (6)
3. A turbine is closely related to the theme, as it often involves the conversion of pressurized fluid energy into mechanical energy, similar to a hydraulic dam. (8)
4. A bicycle tire contains pressurized air, but it is not primarily designed for the regulation or containment of pressurized fluids like the examples. (5)
5. A steam engine involves the use of pressurized steam to generate mechanical power, making it a strong match for the theme. (9)
6. A balloon contains pressurized gas or air, but it is not designed for the regulation or containment of pressurized fluids in the same way as the examples. (2)
7. A car engine involves the combustion of fuel and air, creating pressure that drives the engine's pistons. While it involves pressure, it is not primarily designed for the containment or regulation of pressurized fluids like the examples. (7)
8. A circuit breaker does not match the theme, as it is an electrical device designed to protect circuits from excess current, not involve the containment or regulation of pressurized fluids. (0)
