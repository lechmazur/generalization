Note: The scores are based on how well the candidates match the specific theme of writing or drawing instruments, as exemplified by a pencil, a whiteboard marker, and a soft eraser. The anti-examples (whistle, drum, loudspeaker) are not considered for scoring, as they represent broader or related themes.
