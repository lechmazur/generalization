Explanation:

1. Nuclear fission (2/10): While this process involves subatomic particles, it does not specifically relate to neutrinos, exoplanets, or gravitational waves.
2. Blood cells (1/10): This is a biological example, not related to the theme of astronomical or subatomic phenomena.
3. X-rays (3/10): Although X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, they do not directly relate to the theme of neutrinos, exoplanets, or gravitational waves.
4. Radio waves (2/10): Like X-rays, radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation but do not specifically match the theme.
5. Atoms (1/10): While atoms are a fundamental unit of matter, this example is too broad and does not specifically relate to the theme.
6. Continental drift (1/10): This is a geological process, not related to the theme of astronomical or subatomic phenomena.
7. Cell division (1/10): This is a biological process, not related to the theme of astronomical or subatomic phenomena.
8. Higgs boson (8/10): The Higgs boson is a subatomic particle, and while it is not directly related to neutrinos, exoplanets, or gravitational waves, it is more closely related to the theme than the other candidates.
