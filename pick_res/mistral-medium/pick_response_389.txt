Explanation:

1. Infrared remote controls use a different type of signal transmission (infrared light) and are not broadcasted like satellite television transmissions, Wi-Fi routers, or FM radio broadcasts. (1)
2. Coaxial cables are used to transmit various types of signals, including those for satellite television. However, they are not the transmissions themselves, so they only partially match the theme. (6)
3. Optical fiber networks are used for data transmission, similar to satellite television transmissions and Wi-Fi routers, but they are not broadcasted in the same way as FM radio broadcasts. (2)
4. Telegraph systems use electrical signals sent through wires to transmit messages, which is a different method than the wireless transmissions in the theme. (0)
5. Landline telephones use wired connections to transmit voice data, which is different from the wireless broadcasts in the theme. (5)
6. Bluetooth headphones use short-range wireless technology to connect to devices, but they do not broadcast signals like FM radio or satellite television. (3)
7. Ethernet cables are used to connect devices in a wired network and transmit data, which is different from the wireless broadcasts in the theme. However, they are more closely related than some other examples. (6)
8. Fiber optic cables are used for data transmission like optical fiber networks, but they are not broadcasted in the same way as FM radio or satellite television. (2)
