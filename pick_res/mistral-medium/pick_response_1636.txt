Explanation:

1. The fractal patterns in coral reefs (3): While coral reefs can form complex structures, they are not specifically related to saline waters, phytoplankton blooms, tidal channels, or salt crystals.
2. The intricate branching patterns of mangrove roots in estuarine environments (7): This example is closely related to the theme, as it involves a complex network in a saline environment. However, it does not involve phytoplankton blooms or salt crystals.
3. The fractal patterns in clouds (2): Clouds are not directly related to the theme, as they do not involve saline waters, phytoplankton blooms, tidal channels, or salt crystals.
4. The self-similar patterns in coastlines (4): This example is somewhat related to the theme, as it involves patterns in a coastal environment. However, it does not specifically involve saline waters, phytoplankton blooms, tidal channels, or salt crystals.
5. The branching patterns of trees in a forest (5): While trees can form complex branching patterns, they are not directly related to the theme, as they do not involve saline waters, phytoplankton blooms, tidal channels, or salt crystals.
6. The fractal patterns in the structure of sponges (3): Sponges can form complex structures, but they are not specifically related to the theme, as they do not involve saline waters, phytoplankton blooms, tidal channels, or salt crystals.
7. The fractal geometry of snowflakes (1): Snowflakes are not directly related to the theme, as they do not involve saline waters, phytoplankton blooms, tidal channels, or salt crystals.
8. The fractal patterns in the structure of crystals (8): This example is closely related to the theme, as it involves the formation of crystals. However, it does not specifically involve saline waters, phytoplankton blooms, or tidal channels.
