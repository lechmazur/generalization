Looking at the examples (hydraulic dam, gas cylinder, pressure cooker) versus the anti-examples (scuba tank, fire extinguisher, compressor), I need to identify what specific theme unites the examples but excludes the anti-examples.

The examples all store pressure or potential energy and release it in a controlled manner as part of their primary function. The anti-examples involve pressure but either create it without storing (compressor) or store it for different purposes.
