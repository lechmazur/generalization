Looking at the examples (Jazz music, Pizza, Yoga) versus the anti-examples (Hip hop, Rock music, Basketball), I need to identify what specific characteristic unites the examples but excludes the anti-examples.

The pattern appears to be words that are loanwords from other languages, adopted into English relatively unchanged - Jazz (uncertain origin, possibly African-American vernacular), Pizza (Italian), and Yoga (Sanskrit). The anti-examples are English compounds or native English words.
