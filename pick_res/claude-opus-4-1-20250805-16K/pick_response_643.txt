Looking at the examples (oil reservoirs, coral reefs, coal deposits) versus the anti-examples (salt flats, river deltas, rift valleys), I need to identify what specific characteristic unites the examples that the anti-examples lack.

The examples all appear to be geological formations that are primarily composed of or contain significant amounts of biogenic material (material of biological origin) - oil from ancient organisms, coral from marine organisms, and coal from compressed plant matter. The anti-examples are primarily mineral or tectonic in origin.
