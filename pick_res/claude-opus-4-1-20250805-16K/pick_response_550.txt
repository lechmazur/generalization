Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what specific theme unites GPS navigation, memory foam, and freeze-dried food that doesn't apply to the internet, Kevlar, and water purification tablets.

The examples appear to be technologies originally developed for or significantly advanced by NASA/space programs that became consumer products. The anti-examples are military/defense technologies but not specifically space-related.
