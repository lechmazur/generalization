Looking at the examples (Rhone, Arno, Ebro) versus anti-examples (Tiber, Garonne, Danube), I need to identify what makes the examples unique.

All are European rivers, but the key pattern appears to be: rivers with 4-5 letter names that contain the letter 'o'.

Examples: Rhone (5 letters, has 'o'), Arno (4 letters, has 'o'), Ebro (4 letters, has 'o')
Anti-examples: Tiber (5 letters, no 'o'), Garonne (7 letters - too long), Danube (6 letters - too long, no 'o')
