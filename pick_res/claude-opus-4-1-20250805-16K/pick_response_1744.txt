Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes the specific theme from the broader category of optical devices.

The examples (magic lantern, stereoscope, magnifying glass) appear to be optical devices used for close-range viewing, projection, or magnification with general/entertainment purposes, while the anti-examples (telescope, loupe, binoculars) are either for distance viewing or specialized professional use.
