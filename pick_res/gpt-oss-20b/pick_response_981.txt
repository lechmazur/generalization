<analysis<|message|>I need to determine the specific theme from the examples and anti-examples. The examples are:

1. A deafening whisper  
2. The sound of silence  
3. A living dead  

These are all oxymorons: phrases that combine contradictory terms. The anti‑examples are also oxymorons, but they are meant to be misleading and do not match the *specific* theme. Therefore the specific theme is simply “oxymorons” (paradoxical phrases that pair contradictory words).  

Now I must score each candidate on how well it matches that theme, using a nuanced scale from 0 to 10. I’ll give higher scores to clear oxymorons and lower scores to phrases that are less obviously contradictory or that could be interpreted in other ways.

1. A frozen flame – clear oxymoron → 9  
2. The darkness of light – clear oxymoron → 9  
3. A small giant – clear oxymoron → 9  
4. A quiet storm – clear oxymoron → 9  
5. An invisible color – clear oxymoron → 9  
6. A dry rain – clear oxymoron → 9  
7. A hot ice – clear oxymoron → 9  
8. A silent scream – clear oxymoron → 9  

All candidates are strong oxymorons, so I’ll give them a high score of 9.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>9</score>
<number>4</number><score>9</score>
<number>5</number><score>9</score>
<number>6</number><score>9</score>
<number>7</number><score>9</score>
<number>8</number><score>9</score>
