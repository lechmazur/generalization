These scores reflect how closely each candidate matches the specific theme of high-altitude research or scientific facilities, as exemplified by the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, the University of Denver's High Altitude Laboratory, and the Sphinx Observatory in Switzerland. The Chacaltaya Astrophysical Observatory in Bolivia is a strong match due to its focus on scientific research at high altitude. Other candidates, while related to high-altitude locations, do not primarily serve scientific research purposes.
