The specific theme identified from the examples is "traditional wind instruments from specific cultures." The ocarina and didgeridoo are traditional instruments from specific cultures, similar to the bagpipes, pan flute, and shakuhachi. The recorder is also a traditional instrument, though more broadly used in Western music, hence a slightly lower score. The other instruments are more general and not tied to specific cultural traditions in the same way.
