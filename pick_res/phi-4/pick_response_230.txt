Explanation:
- The specific theme involves mass-produced, seemingly ordinary objects with extraordinary, magical, or unusual abilities.
- Candidates 1 through 4, 6, 7, and 8 are typical household or electronic devices without any magical or unusual abilities, so they score 0.
- Candidate 5, the self-refilling mug, closely matches the theme as it is a mass-produced object with an extraordinary ability, scoring 8.
