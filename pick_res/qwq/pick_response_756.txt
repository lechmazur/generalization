Alright, I have this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, and the theme is based on the examples provided. The examples are Peter Freuchen, Robert Bartlett, and Valerian Albanov. All of them survived extreme situations in icy environments. Peter Freuchen was trapped in an ice cave in Greenland, Robert Bartlett survived 37 days on ice after his ship sank in 1914, and Valerian Albanov survived 3 months after abandoning ship in Franz Josef Land. So, the theme seems to be about survival in extreme Arctic conditions, specifically involving ice.

Now, the anti-examples are Adolphus Greely, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Fridtjof Nansen. These are people who also had Arctic experiences, but for some reason, they don't fit the specific theme as closely as the first three. Adolphus Greely led the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition, which had survival issues, but I think the difference might be in the nature of their experiences. Stefansson was known for his ability to live off the land in the Arctic and had extended periods of survival, but perhaps it's not as focused on a single traumatic event as the examples. Nansen is famous for his Arctic expeditions and drift across the Arctic Ocean, but again, maybe not exactly matching the survival against the elements in the way the first three did.

So, the specific theme seems to be about individuals who had to survive extreme, life-threatening situations in icy environments, possibly after a shipwreck or being stranded, and their stories are marked by personal endurance against the harsh conditions.

With that in mind, let's look at the candidates:

1. Ernest Shackleton: He's famous for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, where his ship Endurance got stuck in ice in the Weddell Sea and was eventually crushed. He and his crew survived on ice floes for months before making a daring open-boat journey to South Georgia and ultimately rescuing all his men. This seems very similar to the examples given, as it involves survival in icy conditions, shipwreck, and enduring harsh environments.

2. Douglas Mawson: He led the Australasian Antarctic Expedition and had a harrowing experience during a journey with two others. One died, and the other became seriously ill, but Mawson survived alone in extreme conditions, having to cut his sledging gear to make progress. While this is in Antarctica, it's still an icy environment, and his survival story is remarkable.

3. Robert Falcon Scott: He led the Terra Nova Expedition to the South Pole and, along with his team, perished on the return journey. They faced extreme conditions, starvation, and ultimately death. So, while he didn't survive, his attempt and the conditions he faced were similar to the others.

4. John Franklin: He led two Arctic expeditions, the second of which was disastrous, with all hands lost to starvation and scurvy after their ships were trapped in ice. Again, similar to Scott, he didn't survive, but his expedition is renowned for its tragic end in harsh Arctic conditions.

5. Knud Rasmussen: He was a Greenlandic-Danish polar explorer who led seven Thule Expeditions across the Arctic. He had extensive experience in the region but is more known for his ethnographic work and successful expeditions rather than surviving a specific life-threatening event.

6. Roald Amundsen: He was the first to reach the South Pole and had successful Arctic expeditions, including navigating the Northwest Passage. While he faced challenges, his expeditions were generally successful, and he didn't have the same level of survival against the elements as some of the others.

7. Otto Sverdrup: He was a Norwegian explorer who mapped large parts of the Arctic Archipelago. He had successful expeditions and didn't have the same survival stories as some of the other candidates.

8. Ada Blackjack: She was an Inupiat-American who survived alone for two years on Wrangel Island after her expedition members died or left. This seems very similar to the examples, as it involves being stranded in an icy environment and surviving against the odds.

So, considering the theme is about survival in extreme icy conditions, often after a shipwreck or being stranded, and focusing on personal endurance, here's how I would score them:

- Ernest Shackleton: 10. His story is iconic in terms of leadership and survival in the Antarctic.

- Douglas Mawson: 9. His survival story is equally compelling, though perhaps less well-known than Shackleton's.

- Robert Falcon Scott: 7. He didn't survive, but his attempt and the conditions he faced are similar.

- John Franklin: 6. Again, didn't survive, but his expedition is famous for its tragic end.

- Knud Rasmussen: 4. He had extensive Arctic experience but isn't known for a specific survival story like the others.

- Roald Amundsen: 3. His expeditions were successful, and he didn't have the same survival challenges.

- Otto Sverdrup: 2. Similar to Amundsen, his expeditions were successful without the same level of survival against the elements.

- Ada Blackjack: 8. Her survival story is remarkable, similar in spirit to the examples given.

So, the scores would be:

<number>1</number><score>10</score>

<number>2</number><score>9</score>

<number>3</number><score>7</score>

<number>4</number><score>6</score>

<number>5</number><score>4</score>

<number>6</number><score>3</score>

<number>7</number><score>2</score>

<number>8</number><score>8</score>

I think this grading reflects how closely their stories match the specific theme of survival in extreme icy conditions, with higher scores going to those who had more direct and analogous experiences to the examples provided.
