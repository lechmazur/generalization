Alright, I've got this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from the examples provided, but not match the broader themes that the anti-examples represent. The examples are Ingapirca, Kuelap, and Pukara de Quitor, and the anti-examples are Tiwanaku, Ollantaytambo, and Chan Chan.

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples. Let's look at each one:

1. Ingapirca: This is in Ecuador and is associated with the Inca civilization. It's known for its ruins and stone structures.

2. Kuelap: Located in Peru, it's a fortress of the Chachapoya people, also known as the "Cloud Warriors." It's famous for its massive stone walls and circular buildings.

3. Pukara de Quitor: This is in Chile and is a pre-Columbian fortress of the Atacameño people. It features stone walls and is situated in a strategic location.

So, commonalities among these examples seem to be:

- They are ancient ruins.

- They serve as fortresses or defensive structures.

- They are made of stone.

- They are located in the Andean region of South America.

Now, looking at the anti-examples:

1. Tiwanaku: This is an important pre-Columbian archaeological site in Bolivia, known for its monumental stone architecture and cultural influence. It's not primarily a fortress but a ceremonial center.

2. Ollantaytambo: Located in Peru, it has both Inca ruins and a living Inca-era town. The ruins include temples and fortifications, so it has elements of both ceremonial and defensive structures.

3. Chan Chan: This was the capital of the Chimor kingdom in Peru, known for its mud-brick architecture and urban planning. It's not primarily a fortress.

From these anti-examples, we can see that they are also ancient Andean sites but differ in their primary functions or materials. Tiwanaku and Chan Chan are more ceremonial or urban centers, and Ollantaytambo, while having fortifications, also has significant ceremonial elements.

So, the specific theme from the examples seems to be "ancient Andean fortresses primarily built with stone." The anti-examples include Andean sites that are more ceremonial or urban in nature, or use different building materials like mud bricks.

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, avoiding those that fit broader or related themes like general Andean archaeological sites or those with mixed functions.

Let's go through each candidate:

1. Ciudad Perdida (Lost City): This is in Colombia and is an ancient city built by the Tayrona people. It consists of a series of terraces and plazas, with stone pathways and steps. While it has stone structures, it's more of a residential and ceremonial center rather than a fortress. So, it doesn't fit the specific theme well.

Score: 2

2. Teotihuacan: This is a vast pre-Columbian city in Mexico, known for its pyramids, temples, and the Avenue of the Dead. It's not in the Andean region, and its primary function was as a major urban center, not a fortress.

Score: 0

3. El Tajín: Located in Mexico, El Tajín was a major city of the Classic period, known for its unique architectural styles, including the Pyramid of the Niches. Again, not in the Andean region and not a fortress.

Score: 0

4. Machu Picchu: This is an Inca site in Peru, often referred to as a fortress due to its location on a mountain ridge and its stone walls. It has defensive features but also served as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti. So, it has elements of both defensive and ceremonial functions.

Score: 6

5. Chichen Itza: This is a large Maya archaeological site in Mexico, featuring temples, pyramids, and other structures. It's not in the Andean region and serves more as a ceremonial center.

Score: 0

6. Sacsayhuamán: This is a Inca walled complex near Cusco, Peru. It's famous for its massive dry-stone walls, and it was used as a fortress during the Spanish conquest. It closely matches the theme of an Andean stone fortress.

Score: 9

7. Caral: This is an ancient city in Peru, one of the oldest in the Americas, dating back to circa 2600 BCE. It's known for its pyramidal structures and is considered the seat of the Norte Chico civilization. It's not primarily a fortress.

Score: 1

8. Copán: This is a Maya archaeological site in Honduras, known for its intricate stelae and ruins of temples and plazas. Not in the Andean region and not a fortress.

Score: 0

So, summarizing the scores:

<number>1</number><score>2</score>

<number>2</number><score>0</score>

<number>3</number><score>0</score>

<number>4</number><score>6</score>

<number>5</number><score>0</score>

<number>6</number><score>9</score>

<number>7</number><score>1</score>

<number>8</number><score>0</score>

I've tried to be nuanced in my scoring, giving higher scores to those that more closely match the specific theme of Andean stone fortresses, while lower scores to those that, while having some similarities, don't fit as precisely.
