Alright, I've got this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on how well they match a specific theme that's defined by the examples given, and avoid being influenced by the anti-examples. Let's start by understanding what the specific theme is from the examples provided.

The examples are:

- Mayan pyramids used for religious ceremonies

- Stupas in Buddhist traditions

- Totem poles in Indigenous cultures

So, these are all architectural or cultural structures that are used for religious or ceremonial purposes within specific cultural or religious contexts.

Now, the anti-examples are:

- Chinese pagodas

- Greek temples

- Egyptian obelisks

These are also religious or culturally significant structures, but for some reason, they don't fit the specific theme. Maybe the theme is more narrow than just religious structures.

Looking back at the examples:

- Mayan pyramids: used for religious ceremonies

- Stupas: Buddhist traditions

- Totem poles: Indigenous cultures

I notice that these structures are integral parts of the religious practices or cultural identities of these societies. They are not just monuments or architectural achievements but have specific functional roles in religious ceremonies or hold sacred significance.

On the other hand, the anti-examples:

- Chinese pagodas: while they are associated with Buddhism, they are more about housing relics or being places for meditation, but maybe not the primary site for ceremonies.

- Greek temples: were places of worship in ancient Greece, but perhaps their function differs in some way from the examples.

- Egyptian obelisks: these were religious monuments, but again, maybe their specific use differs.

So, perhaps the specific theme is about structures that are central to religious ceremonies or rituals, and are specific to certain cultural or religious traditions.

With that in mind, let's look at the candidates:

1. Roman amphitheaters

Roman amphitheaters, like the Colosseum, were large venues for public spectacles, including gladiatorial contests, dramas, and public executions. While they had some religious elements, such as offerings to gods, their primary function was for public entertainment rather than religious ceremonies. So, they might have some connection to religion, but it's not their central purpose.

Score: 2

2. Torii gates in Shinto shrines

Torii gates are iconic entrances to Shinto shrines in Japan. They signify the transition from the profane to the sacred. While they are integral to Shinto shrines, their primary function is as a gateway, not as a site for religious ceremonies themselves.

Score: 4

3. Native American sweat lodges

Sweat lodges are sacred spaces used by many Indigenous cultures in North America for purification and healing ceremonies. They are directly involved in religious and spiritual practices, similar to the Mayan pyramids and totem poles in the examples.

Score: 8

4. Stonehenge

Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument in England, believed to have been used for religious ceremonies or astronomical observations. Its exact purpose is still debated, but it is considered a site of spiritual significance and possible ceremonial activities.

Score: 6

5. Islamic minarets

Minarets are tall towers attached to mosques, used for calling Muslims to prayer. While they are part of religious structures, their primary function is to broadcast the call to prayer, not to serve as a site for ceremonies.

Score: 3

6. Medieval cathedrals

Medieval cathedrals were central to Christian worship and served as sites for various religious ceremonies and masses. They are integral to the religious life of the communities they serve, similar to the Mayan pyramids and Hindu temples.

Score: 9

7. Hindu temples

Hindu temples are sacred spaces where worshippers perform puja and other rituals. They are central to Hindu religious practices and ceremonies, akin to the Mayan pyramids and Buddhist stupas.

Score: 9

8. Aztec ball courts

Aztec ball courts were used for the Mesoamerican ballgame, which had religious and cultural significance. The game was often connected to religious rituals and could have ceremonial importance.

Score: 5

So, summarizing the scores:

- Roman amphitheaters: 2

- Torii gates in Shinto shrines: 4

- Native American sweat lodges: 8

- Stonehenge: 6

- Islamic minarets: 3

- Medieval cathedrals: 9

- Hindu temples: 9

- Aztec ball courts: 5
