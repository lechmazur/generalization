Alright, I've got this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from the examples provided: Roy Harris, Aaron Copland, and Henry Cowell. The anti-examples are William Grant Still, George Gershwin, and Leonard Bernstein. So, I need to figure out what ties the first three together and then see how the candidates relate to that specific theme, while making sure not to get influenced by broader themes that might include the anti-examples.

First, I need to understand who these composers are and what sets them apart.

Starting with the examples:

1. **Roy Harris**: He's an American composer known for his symphonies and choral works. He was part of the mid-20th century American classical music scene.

2. **Aaron Copland**: Another American composer, often called the "dean of American composers." He's famous for works like "Appalachian Spring" and "Fanfare for the Common Man." His music is often associated with a distinct American sound.

3. **Henry Cowell**: An American composer and pianist who was known for his unorthodox playing techniques and his influence on later composers like John Cage.

Now, the anti-examples:

1. **William Grant Still**: An African-American composer known for his symphonies and opera. He's often referred to as the "Dean of African-American composers."

2. **George Gershwin**: A renowned American composer who融合了古典和爵士乐元素，以其作品如《蓝色狂想曲》和《一个美国人在巴黎》闻名。

3. **Leonard Bernstein**: An American composer, conductor, and educator who was very versatile, known for both classical and Broadway works like "West Side Story."

So, what's the specific theme here? It seems like all the examples are American composers from the 20th century, focusing on classical music with a distinct American style. The anti-examples are also American composers from the same period, but perhaps with different influences or genres.

Maybe the theme is more specific to a certain movement or style within American classical music. Let's dig deeper.

Roy Harris, Aaron Copland, and Henry Cowell were all part of the "American nationalist" movement in music, which sought to create a unique American musical identity distinct from European traditions. They drew inspiration from folk music, American landscapes, and cultural themes.

On the other hand, George Gershwin was known for blending classical music with jazz and popular styles, William Grant Still for his contributions as an African-American composer, and Leonard Bernstein for his versatility across classical and popular genres.

So, perhaps the specific theme is composers who are purely within the American nationalist classical music tradition, without significant influence from popular music or other genres.

With that in mind, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **Charles Ives**: An American composer known for his modernist approach and incorporation of American folk music and hymns. He's often considered a pioneer of modern classical music in America.

   - He fits the American nationalist theme, but his style is more experimental and modernist compared to Copland and Harris. So, he might be a good match but not perfect.

   - Score: 7

2. **Howard Hanson**: An American composer and conductor who was the long-time director of the Eastman School of Music. He's known for his symphonies and choral works.

   - He fits the profile of an American classical composer, but I'm not sure about the extent of his focus on American nationalism.

   - Score: 5

3. **Amy Beach**: An American composer who was one of the first successful women in American classical music. She wrote in a romantic style with some American elements.

   - She was an American composer, but her style was more influenced by European romanticism. So, she might not fit the American nationalist theme as strongly.

   - Score: 4

4. **Percy Grainger**: An Australian-born composer who later became an American citizen. He's known for his folksong arrangements and innovative use of musical instruments.

   - He had a strong interest in folk music and innovative musical techniques, which aligns somewhat with the American nationalist composers.

   - However, his background is Australian, which might make his connection to American nationalism less direct.

   - Score: 6

5. **Charles Griffes**: An American composer who was influential in introducing modernist European music to the United States.

   - He was an American composer, but his focus was more on incorporating European modernist elements rather than developing a purely American nationalist style.

   - Score: 3

6. **Béla Bartók**: A Hungarian composer who is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century. He was known for his incorporation of folk elements from Eastern Europe.

   - He's not American, which is a major discrepancy. So, he doesn't fit the American nationalist theme at all.

   - Score: 0

7. **Ralph Vaughan Williams**: An English composer who was part of the movement to revive and promote English folk music in classical compositions.

   - Similar to Bartók, he was focused on his own national folk traditions, but he's English, not American.

   - Score: 0

8. **Igor Stravinsky**: A Russian composer who later became French and American. He's one of the most influential composers of the 20th century.

   - He's not American, and his early works are rooted in Russian folk traditions.

   - Although he did become an American citizen, his primary musical identity is not as an American nationalist composer.

   - Score: 1

So, summarizing the scores:

- Charles Ives: 7

- Howard Hanson: 5

- Amy Beach: 4

- Percy Grainger: 6

- Charles Griffes: 3

- Béla Bartók: 0

- Ralph Vaughan Williams: 0

- Igor Stravinsky: 1

I think these scores reflect how closely each candidate aligns with the specific theme of American nationalist classical composers, as exemplified by Roy Harris, Aaron Copland, and Henry Cowell, while distinguishing them from the anti-examples like Gershwin, Bernstein, and Still.
