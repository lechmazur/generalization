Alright, I've got this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, and the theme is defined by three examples and three anti-examples. So, first things first, I need to understand what exactly the theme is.

Looking at the examples:

1. Lenticular prints that change image based on the viewing angle.

2. 3D stereogram images that reveal a hidden picture when viewed with a relaxed focus.

3. Thin section petrography slides that show mineral structures under polarized light.

And the anti-examples:

1. Optical illusions that play with perspective.

2. Interactive digital art that changes with user input.

3. Transparent sculptures that show internal structures.

So, the theme seems to be about visual representations or images that have some sort of multi-dimensional or multi-layered aspect, but specifically in how they change or reveal different information based on certain conditions.

Let me try to distill the common elements in the examples:

- They all involve some kind of image or visual representation.

- They all have a property where the image changes or reveals different information based on specific viewing conditions:

- Lenticular prints: change based on viewing angle.

- Stereograms: reveal hidden images with a specific focusing technique.

- Petrography slides: show mineral structures under polarized light.

So, the theme seems to be about visual media that exhibit different appearances or reveal different information under different viewing conditions, specifically conditions related to the viewer's perspective or the way the image is observed.

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. Optical illusions that play with perspective.

2. Interactive digital art that changes with user input.

3. Transparent sculptures that show internal structures.

These are related but not exactly matching the specific theme. So, what's the difference?

- Optical illusions: they play with perspective, but maybe not in the same way as the examples. Perhaps they don't have the same level of conditional revelation.

- Interactive digital art: changes with user input, which is different from passive viewing conditions like angle or focus.

- Transparent sculptures: show internal structures, but maybe not in a way that requires specific viewing conditions like the examples do.

So, the theme seems to be more about passive viewing conditions that inherently cause the image to change or reveal information, without active user interaction beyond changing the viewing angle or focus.

With that in mind, let's look at the candidates:

1. Collages made from overlapping images.

- Collages can have layers, and different elements might be visible depending on the focus or angle, but it's not necessarily designed to change images based on viewing angle like lenticular prints. So, it's related but not a perfect match.

- Score: 3

2. Scientific diagrams with labeled layers.

- These show different layers labeled for clarity, but they don't change based on viewing conditions. They are static representations.

- Score: 1

3. Holographic art pieces that display different images depending on the light source and angle.

- Holograms do change based on the viewing angle and light source, similar to lenticular prints. This seems like a strong match.

- Score: 8

4. 3D printed objects with internal structures.

- 3D printed objects can show different aspects as you view them from different angles, but it's not exactly like the examples, which are specifically about images changing based on viewing conditions.

- Score: 4

5. Landscape paintings showing depth through layering.

- These use layering to create a sense of depth, but they don't change based on viewing angle or focus in the same way as the examples.

- Score: 2

6. Geological strata visible in cliff faces.

- Similar to petrography slides, but in a larger, natural setting. They show different layers based on the angle of view, but it's not an image that changes so much as a physical structure that reveals different layers.

- Score: 5

7. Photographs with multiple exposures.

- These combine multiple images into one, and different elements might stand out under different lighting or focusing, but it's not designed to change based on viewing conditions like the examples.

- Score: 2

8. Virtual reality environments with multiple layers of interaction.

- VR environments can have multiple layers of interaction, but this is more about user interaction rather than passive viewing conditions causing the image to change.

- Score: 4

So, summarizing the scores:

<number>1</number><score>3</score>

<number>2</number><score>1</score>

<number>3</number><score>8</score>

<number>4</number><score>4</score>

<number>5</number><score>2</score>

<number>6</number><score>5</score>

<number>7</number><score>2</score>

<number>8</number><score>4</score>

I think this captures the essence of how well each candidate matches the specific theme defined by the examples, while distinguishing them from the anti-examples.
