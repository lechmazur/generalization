Alright, I have this task here. I need to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from three examples, but not match the broader themes represented by three anti-examples. The examples are Garry Kasparov, Boris Gelfand, and Viswanathan Anand. The anti-examples are a chess strategy book, a chess coach, and a chess commentator.

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the examples. Garry Kasparov, Boris Gelfand, and Viswanathan Anand are all renowned chess players. Kasparov was the world chess champion for many years, Gelfand is a strong grandmaster who has challenged for the championship, and Anand has also held the world championship title. So, the specific theme seems to be "prominent chess players."

Now, the anti-examples are a chess strategy book, a chess coach, and a chess commentator. These are related to chess but are not chess players themselves. A strategy book is about chess, a coach teaches chess, and a commentator analyzes chess games. So, the anti-examples are about chess but represent different roles or entities related to the game.

My task is to evaluate the candidates based on how well they match the specific theme of prominent chess players, not the broader themes represented by the anti-examples.

Let's look at each candidate one by one.

Candidate 1: a chess puzzle.

A chess puzzle is a type of exercise or problem in chess, designed to test a player's skill or knowledge. It's related to chess but isn't a player. So, it doesn't match the specific theme of prominent chess players. It might be considered under a broader theme of chess-related items, but not the specific theme here. So, I would give this a low score, maybe a 1 or 2.

Candidate 2: a chess streamer.

A chess streamer is someone who broadcasts chess games or content online, often on platforms like Twitch or YouTube. While they might be chess players themselves, the term "chess streamer" refers to their role in streaming chess content, not necessarily their standing as players. Some streamers are strong players, but others may not be top-level players. So, it's somewhat related but not directly matching the specific theme of prominent chess players. I might give this a 3 or 4.

Candidate 3: a chess tournament.

A chess tournament is an organized event where chess players compete against each other. It's a category or event related to chess but not a player本人. So, it doesn't match the specific theme of prominent chess players. I would score this similarly to the chess puzzle, maybe a 1 or 2.

Candidate 4: Vladimir Kramnik.

Vladimir Kramnik is another renowned chess player who has held the world championship title. He's in the same category as Kasparov, Gelfand, and Anand. So, this perfectly matches the specific theme. I would give this a 10.

Candidate 5: a chess endgame.

A chess endgame is a phase of the chess game when there are few pieces left on the board, and the strategic focus shifts to converting advantages or achieving a draw. It's a specific part of chess theory and study. This isn't a player but a concept within chess. So, it doesn't match the specific theme. I would give this a 0 or 1.

Candidate 6: a chess middlegame.

Similar to the endgame, the middlegame is another phase of the chess game, occurring between the opening and the endgame. Again, it's a concept, not a player. So, I would score this similarly to the endgame, maybe a 0 or 1.

Candidate 7: a chess club.

A chess club is an organization or group of people who share an interest in chess, often meeting to play games or attend lectures. It's related to chess but isn't a player. So, it doesn't match the specific theme. I would give this a low score, perhaps a 1 or 2.

Candidate 8: a chess opening.

A chess opening is the initial moves of a chess game, where players establish their piece positions and strategic plans. Like the endgame and middlegame, it's a theoretical aspect of chess, not a player. So, I would score this similarly to the others, maybe a 0 or 1.

In summary, the candidates that are prominent chess players should get the highest scores, while those that are related to chess but not players should get lower scores. The rankings should reflect this distinction clearly.

## Final Scores
To solve this task, we need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it matches the specific theme identified from the examples, which is "prominent chess players," while avoiding the broader themes represented by the anti-examples.

### Approach
1. **Identify the Theme**: The examples provided are Garry Kasparov, Boris Gelfand, and Viswanathan Anand, all of whom are renowned chess players.
2. **Understand Anti-Examples**: The anti-examples are a chess strategy book, a chess coach, and a chess commentator, which are related to chess but not players themselves.
3. **Evaluate Candidates**: Score each candidate from 0 to 10 based on how closely they match the specific theme of prominent chess players.

### Solution Code
```plaintext
<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>4</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>10</score>
<number>5</number><score>1</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>2</score>
<number>8</number><score>1</score>
```

### Explanation
- **Candidate 1: a chess puzzle** - Related to chess but not a player. Score: 2
- **Candidate 2: a chess streamer** - May be a player but primarily a streamer. Score: 4
- **Candidate 3: a chess tournament** - An event, not a player. Score: 2
- **Candidate 4: Vladimir Kramnik** - Prominent chess player. Score: 10
- **Candidate 5: a chess endgame** - Chess concept, not a player. Score: 1
- **Candidate 6: a chess middlegame** - Chess concept, not a player. Score: 1
- **Candidate 7: a chess club** - Organization, not a player. Score: 2
- **Candidate 8: a chess opening** - Chess concept, not a player. Score: 1

This scoring ensures that only candidates that are prominent chess players receive the highest scores, while those related to chess but not players receive lower scores accordingly.
