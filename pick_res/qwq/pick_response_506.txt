Alright, I've got this task here. There are three examples: Great Auk, Passenger Pigeon, and Steller's Sea Cow. Then there are three anti-examples: Golden Toad, Pyrenean Ibex, and Western Black Rhinoceros. I need to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match the specific theme of the examples, but not the broader or related themes that the anti-examples might suggest.

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples. Let's look at each one:

1. Great Auk: This was a large flightless bird that was hunted to extinction in the 19th century.

2. Passenger Pigeon: Once numerous in North America, it was hunted extensively and declined rapidly, with the last known individual dying in 1914.

3. Steller's Sea Cow: A large marine mammal that was hunted to extinction by sailors in the 18th century.

So, commonalities here are that they are all animals that have been driven to extinction, primarily due to human activities like hunting.

Now, the anti-examples:

1. Golden Toad: Declared extinct in 2004, possibly due to a combination of climate change and fungal disease.

2. Pyrenean Ibex: Became extinct in 2000 due to overhunting and habitat loss.

3. Western Black Rhinoceros: Declared extinct in 2011, primarily due to poaching.

These also involve extinction due to human activities, but perhaps with different causesâ€”while the examples seem to focus on hunting, the anti-examples include other factors like habitat loss and climate change.

So, maybe the specific theme is animals that were hunted to extinction, and the anti-examples include extinctions caused by broader human activities or different causes.

Therefore, I should score the candidates based on how strongly they match the theme of being hunted to extinction, giving higher scores to those more clearly hunted to extinction, and lower scores to those where extinction was due to other human activities or less direct causes.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. Japanese Sea Lion: Hunted and overfishing led to its decline; declared extinct around 1970. Hunting is a significant factor here, so this should get a high score.

2. Caribbean Monk Seal: Last sighted in 1952; likely extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction. Both hunting and habitat loss are factors, so perhaps a bit lower than the Japanese Sea Lion, which was more directly hunted.

3. Quagga: A subspecies of the plains zebra, hunted to extinction in the late 19th century. Direct hunting is the primary cause, so this should be scored high.

4. Heath Hen: A subspecies of the greater prairie chicken, driven to extinction due to overhunting and habitat loss. Again, both hunting and habitat loss are factors, so similar to the Caribbean Monk Seal.

5. Tasmanian Tiger: Last recorded captive individual died in 1936; hunted to extinction due to bounty programs and habitat loss. Both hunting and habitat loss are factors.

6. Baiji Dolphin: Declared functionally extinct in 2006 due to habitat loss, pollution, and boat traffic. Hunting is not the primary cause here, so this should get a lower score.

7. Atlas Bear: A subspecies of the brown bear, extinct since the 1870s; hunted to extinction due to persecution and habitat loss. Hunting is a significant factor, similar to the Japanese Sea Lion and Quagga.

8. Carolina Parakeet: Last confirmed sighting in the early 20th century; extinct due to habitat loss and hunting. Both factors are present, similar to the Heath Hen and Tasmanian Tiger.

Considering these factors, I'll assign scores from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best match to the specific theme of being hunted to extinction.

1. Japanese Sea Lion: 9. Direct hunting was a major cause, and it was hunted to extinction.

2. Caribbean Monk Seal: 7. Both hunting and habitat loss were factors, but hunting was significant.

3. Quagga: 9. Directly hunted to extinction.

4. Heath Hen: 8. Overhunting was a primary cause, along with habitat loss.

5. Tasmanian Tiger: 8. Bounty hunting and habitat loss; hunting was a major factor.

6. Baiji Dolphin: 3. Primarily due to habitat loss, pollution, and boat traffic, not hunting.

7. Atlas Bear: 8. Hunted to extinction due to persecution and habitat loss.

8. Carolina Parakeet: 6. Both habitat loss and hunting were factors, but habitat loss may have been more significant.

These scores reflect the degree to which each candidate was hunted to extinction, with higher scores for those more directly and primarily hunted to extinction, and lower scores for those where other factors played a larger role.

**Final Scores:**

<number>2</number><score>7</score>
