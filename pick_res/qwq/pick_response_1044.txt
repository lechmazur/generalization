Alright, I have this task to evaluate these candidates based on a specific theme derived from the given examples, and I need to avoid being misled by the anti-examples. Let's start by understanding the theme from the examples provided.

First, there's the myth of Phaethon's ride in the sun chariot, which causes celestial chaos. This is from Greek mythology and has parallels in other mythologies. So, it's about a specific myth involving celestial elements that is found across different cultures.

Next, there's the flood narrative, which is associated with a celestial event, appearing in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Bible, and other ancient texts. Again, it's a specific story involving celestial elements across various cultures.

Then, there's the celestial event of the sun standing still, described in the Book of Joshua, with similarities in ancient Chinese and Mesoamerican records. This seems to be about a particular celestial phenomenon that is recorded in multiple cultural histories.

Now, looking at the anti-examples: solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, and comet Halley, all of which are celestial events noted in ancient records from various cultures. These are observations of natural phenomena documented across different civilizations.

The key difference, I think, is that the examples are about specific myths or narratives associated with celestial events, whereas the anti-examples are more about the factual observation and recording of celestial phenomena without necessarily being embedded in a myth or story.

So, the specific theme seems to be: specific myths or narratives involving celestial events that are found across different cultures.

With that in mind, let's evaluate each candidate:

1. The myth of the Milky Way, appearing in Greek, Chinese, and Aboriginal Australian stories.

This seems to fit the theme. It's a specific myth about the Milky Way, which is a celestial object, and it's found in multiple cultures. So, this should get a high score, maybe a 9 or 10.

2. The myth of Orion, the hunter, appearing in Greek, Egyptian, and Arabian mythologies.

Orion is a constellation, which is a celestial object, and the myth is present in multiple cultures. This also fits the theme well, perhaps a 9.

3. The myth of the Pleiades star cluster, appearing in Greek, Native American, and Aboriginal Australian stories.

Again, a specific myth about a celestial object shared across cultures. This should also get a high score, maybe a 9.

4. The myth of the constellation Cygnus, appearing in Greek, Native American, and Siberian stories.

Similar to Orion and Pleiades, this is a myth about a celestial object found in multiple cultures. Another 9.

5. The myth of the constellation Ursa Major, appearing in Greek, Native American, and Finnish stories.

Same as above, a myth about a celestial object across different cultures. Score of 9.

6. The supernova of 1054 AD, observed and recorded by Chinese, Japanese, and Arab astronomers.

This seems more like an observational record of a celestial event rather than a myth or narrative. It's similar to the anti-examples, which are observations without necessarily being embedded in a myth. So, this doesn't fit the specific theme as well as the others. Maybe a 4.

7. The Star of Bethlehem, observed at the time of Jesus's birth, mentioned in Christian texts and has parallels in other ancient cultures.

This is a bit tricky. The Star of Bethlehem is a celestial event embedded in a narrative, and there are parallels in other cultures. So, it seems to fit the theme somewhat, but perhaps not as perfectly as the purely mythological examples. Maybe a 7.

8. The myth of the constellation Cassiopeia, appearing in Greek, African, and Polynesian stories.

Again, a myth about a celestial object found in multiple cultures. This should get a high score, perhaps a 9.

Overall, candidates 1 through 5 and 8 are strong matches for the theme, while candidate 6 is a weaker match, and candidate 7 is somewhere in the middle.

To summarize:

1. Milky Way myth: 9

2. Orion myth: 9

3. Pleiades myth: 9

4. Cygnus myth: 9

5. Ursa Major myth: 9

6. Supernova 1054 AD: 4

7. Star of Bethlehem: 7

8. Cassiopeia myth: 9
