Alright, I have this task here. I need to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from three examples, but exclude the anti-examples. The examples are personal computer, wireless communication, and helicopter. The anti-examples are quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples. Let's look at them one by one.

Personal computer: That's a device we use for computing, processing information, running software, etc. It's a physical machine that performs various tasks based on user input and stored programs.

Wireless communication: This is a method of data transfer over a distance without any physical connection. It includes technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, etc. It's about sending and receiving information without wires.

Helicopter: This is a type of aircraft that uses rotors to achieve lift and thrust. It's a vehicle designed for vertical takeoff and landing, and it's used for transportation, rescue operations, and more.

So, what do these three have in common? They are all technologies, but more specifically, they are all inventions that have significantly impacted human life in terms of computation, communication, and transportation.

Let me think about their characteristics:

- Personal computer: Involves processing and storing information.

- Wireless communication: Involves transmitting information without physical connections.

- Helicopter: Involves transportation and flight.

What unites them is that they are all technological innovations that have transformed how we live, work, and communicate. However, the anti-examples are quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.

Quantum computing is a more advanced form of computing, but it's not the same as a personal computer. Artificial intelligence is a field of study that enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, and blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. These are broader concepts that aren't exactly like the specific examples given.

So, perhaps the theme is more about specific inventions or machines that have had a significant impact in their respective fields, as opposed to broader technologies or fields of study.

Let me consider that. The examples are all specific inventions:

- Personal computer: A specific type of machine.

- Wireless communication: A specific method of data transfer.

- Helicopter: A specific type of aircraft.

While the anti-examples are broader concepts or more abstract technologies:

- Quantum computing: A field of computing that includes various technologies and theories.

- Artificial intelligence: A broad field involving multiple approaches and applications.

- Blockchain: A technology with various applications, not a single invention.

So, maybe the theme is specific inventions or machines, as opposed to broad fields or concepts.

With that in mind, I need to evaluate the eight candidates based on how well they fit this criterion of being specific inventions or machines, similar to the examples, but not as broad as the anti-examples.

Let's look at each candidate:

1. Genetic engineering: This is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, but it's more of a field or a technique rather than a specific invention. So, it might be too broad, similar to artificial intelligence.

2. Virtual reality: This is a technology that creates simulated environments, often experienced through headsets. It's more of a general concept with various applications, similar to artificial intelligence.

3. 3D printing: This is a specific technology for creating physical objects from digital models. It's more of a specific invention, similar to a personal computer or a helicopter.

4. Internet: This is a global network of computers connected by various methods of communication. It's more of an interconnected system than a specific invention, perhaps similar to wireless communication but broader.

5. Telephone: This is a specific invention for voice communication over a distance. It's similar to wireless communication but more specific.

6. Electric light bulb: This is a specific invention for producing light using electricity. It's similar to a personal computer in that it's a specific device with a particular function.

7. Radio: This is a technology for transmitting sounds and signals wirelessly. It's similar to wireless communication.

8. Airplane: This is a specific invention for airborne transportation, similar to a helicopter.

Now, I need to score them from 0 to 10 based on how well they match the specific theme of being specific inventions or machines, like the examples, but not as broad as the anti-examples.

Let me think about it:

- Personal computer: Specific invention, score 10.

- Wireless communication: Specific method, score 8.

- Helicopter: Specific invention, score 10.

- Quantum computing: Broader field, score 0.

- Artificial intelligence: Broad field, score 0.

- Blockchain: Specific technology but more abstract, score 2.

So, for the candidates:

1. Genetic engineering: Broad field, score 1.

2. Virtual reality: General concept with various applications, score 3.

3. 3D printing: Specific technology, score 7.

4. Internet: Broad system, score 4.

5. Telephone: Specific invention, score 9.

6. Electric light bulb: Specific invention, score 10.

7. Radio: Specific technology, score 8.

8. Airplane: Specific invention, score 10.

Wait, let me double-check these scores.

Genetic engineering is a broad field, so it's more like artificial intelligence, score 0 or 1.

Virtual reality is a general concept, so maybe score 2.

3D printing is a specific technology, similar to a personal computer, score 9.

Internet is broad, but it's a specific network, so maybe score 5.

Telephone is a specific invention, similar to a helicopter, score 10.

Electric light bulb is a specific invention, score 10.

Radio is a specific technology, score 9.

Airplane is a specific invention, score 10.

Hmm, perhaps I need to make the scores more nuanced.

Let me consider that personal computer and electric light bulb are both specific inventions, but the light bulb is a single device with a specific function, while the computer is more versatile. Maybe the computer is a higher score than the light bulb.

But in this context, both are specific inventions, so perhaps they should have similar scores.

Similarly, wireless communication and radio are related, but radio is a specific application of wireless communication.

Maybe I should adjust the scores accordingly.

Let me try again:

1. Genetic engineering: Broad field, score 0.

2. Virtual reality: General concept, score 2.

3. 3D printing: Specific technology, score 7.

4. Internet: Broad system, but a specific network, score 4.

5. Telephone: Specific invention, score 8.

6. Electric light bulb: Specific invention, score 8.

7. Radio: Specific technology, score 7.

8. Airplane: Specific invention, score 9.

Yes, this seems more appropriate.

Now, to present the scores in the required format:

<number>1</number><score>0</score>

<number>2</number><score>2</score>

<number>3</number><score>7</score>

<number>4</number><score>4</score>

<number>5</number><score>8</score>

<number>6</number><score>8</score>

<number>7</number><score>7</score>

<number>8</number><score>9</score>

I think this adequately reflects how well each candidate matches the specific theme based on the examples provided, while distinguishing them from the anti-examples.

**Final Scores:**

1. Genetic engineering: 0

2. Virtual reality: 2

3. 3D printing: 7

4. Internet: 4

5. Telephone: 8

6. Electric light bulb: 8

7. Radio: 7

8. Airplane: 9
