Alright, I have this task to evaluate these candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from some examples and anti-examples. Let's see if I can figure this out.

First, let's look at the examples:

1. A fairground that converts to a horse racing track for events in June, October, and February.

2. An arena that hosts horse jumping events in May, September, and January.

3. A stadium that transforms into a venue for horse shows in April, August, and December.

So, these are all venues that are specifically set up for horse events at particular times of the year. They seem to have a transformation or conversion for these events, and they're focused on different types of horse activities: racing, jumping, and shows.

Now, the anti-examples:

1. A city square that hosts a horse-drawn carriage event quarterly.

2. A theater that occasionally hosts horse-themed performances.

3. A shopping mall that hosts a horse-themed festival once a year.

These seem to be more general or less directly related to the core theme. The city square has horse-drawn carriages, which involve horses, but it's not necessarily about horse competitions or transformations of the venue. The theater has horse-themed performances, which are related to horses but not directly to horse activities like racing or jumping. The shopping mall has a horse-themed festival, which again is more of a thematic event rather than a specific horse activity.

From this, I need to deduce the specific theme that the first three examples represent, and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they match that theme, while distinguishing them from the broader or less direct themes represented by the anti-examples.

Let me try to define the specific theme:

The specific theme seems to be venues that are specifically transformed or dedicated to horse competitions or events at regular intervals throughout the year. The key elements appear to be:

- Specific transformation or conversion of the venue for horse events.

- Regular scheduling of these events (specific months).

- Focus on competitive or performance-oriented horse activities (racing, jumping, shows).

The anti-examples, on the other hand, involve more general or less directly related horse activities, such as carriage events, themed performances, or festivals. These are still related to horses but don't involve the specific transformation of venues for competitive events.

With that in mind, let's evaluate each candidate:

1. A convention center that hosts equestrian competitions in March, July, and November.

- This seems very similar to the examples. A convention center is being transformed for equestrian competitions, which are specific horse events, and they have a regular schedule. So, this should be a good match.

2. A racetrack that hosts horse races every weekend.

- A racetrack is already designed for horse races, so there's no transformation needed. It's a permanent setup for horse racing. The examples involved venues that转换to horse event venues, so this might not match as well.

3. A festival ground that hosts a horse-themed carnival annually.

- A festival ground hosting a horse-themed carnival once a year. This sounds more like a general festival with a horse theme, possibly including various activities, but not necessarily focused on specific horse competitions like racing or jumping. This seems closer to the anti-examples.

4. A beach that hosts horse races during the summer months.

- A beach hosting horse races. This might involve some transformation or setup, but beaches aren't typical venues for horse races, so it's unusual. It's a specific horse activity, but the venue is more natural and might not require the same level of transformation as the examples.

5. A sports complex that hosts horse polo matches monthly.

- A sports complex hosting horse polo matches regularly. This is a specific horse activity, and it might require some transformation of the venue for horse polo. This seems similar to the examples.

6. A community center that hosts a horse show every other month.

- A community center hosting horse shows at regular intervals. This is similar to the stadium in the examples that transforms for horse shows. So, this should be a good match.

7. A gymnasium that hosts a horse-themed charity event biannually.

- A gymnasium hosting a horse-themed charity event. This sounds more like a general event with a horse theme, possibly including activities or exhibitions, but not necessarily focused on competitive horse events. This seems closer to the anti-examples.

8. A park that hosts a horse parade annually.

- A park hosting a horse parade once a year. This is a specific horse activity, but it's more of a parade than a competitive event. It might not require the same level of venue transformation as the examples.

Now, let's assign scores based on how well they match the specific theme:

1. Convention center hosting equestrian competitions: This is very similar to the examples, with transformation and specific, regular horse competitions. Score: 9

2. Racetrack hosting horse races every weekend: No transformation needed, as it's a permanent racetrack. Doesn't match the transformation element. Score: 2

3. Festival ground hosting a horse-themed carnival annually: More general, thematic event, closer to anti-examples. Score: 1

4. Beach hosting horse races during summer months: Unusual venue, specific activity, but likely less transformation needed. Score: 4

5. Sports complex hosting horse polo matches monthly: Specific horse activity with likely transformation. Similar to examples. Score: 8

6. Community center hosting a horse show every other month: Similar to the stadium in the examples. Good match. Score: 9

7. Gymnasium hosting a horse-themed charity event biannually: More general thematic event. Closer to anti-examples. Score: 2

8. Park hosting a horse parade annually: Specific horse activity, but likely less transformation needed. Score: 3

So, the scores are:

<number>1</number><score>9</score>

<number>2</number><score>2</score>

<number>3</number><score>1</score>

<number>4</number><score>4</score>

<number>5</number><score>8</score>

<number>6</number><score>9</score>

<number>7</number><score>2</score>

<number>8</number><score>3</score>

I hope this makes sense. I tried to consider both the transformation aspect and the specificity of the horse activities in assigning the scores.
