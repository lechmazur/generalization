Alright, I've got this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from the examples provided, but avoid being influenced by the anti-examples. The examples are Miami Circle, Majorville Medicine Wheel, and Bighorn Medicine Wheel. The anti-examples are Callanish Stones, Ring of Brodgar, and Avebury.

First, I need to understand what the specific theme is from the examples. Let's look at each one:

1. **Miami Circle**: This is a prehistoric earthwork located in Miami, Florida. It's a circular feature with post molds indicating a wooden structure. It's associated with the Glades culture.

2. **Majorville Medicine Wheel**: Located in Alberta, Canada, this is an ancient stone cairn and buffalo drive complex. Medicine wheels are sacred sites often associated with astronomical alignments.

3. **Bighorn Medicine Wheel**: Situated in Wyoming, USA, this is another medicine wheel, a stone structure with spokes radiating from a central cairn. It's also associated with astronomical observations.

So, from these, it seems like the theme involves ancient, often circular, stone structures that have ceremonial or astronomical significance.

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. **Callanish Stones**: A stone circle in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, with standing stones arranged in a cross pattern. It's known for its alignment with the moon.

2. **Ring of Brodgar**: A Neolithic henge and stone circle in Orkney, Scotland. It's part of a larger complex of ancient sites.

3. **Avebury**: A Neolithic henge monument in Wiltshire, England, consisting of a large stone circle and various other earthworks.

These are also ancient stone structures with ceremonial and astronomical alignments. So, what's the difference? Maybe the specific type or the cultural context?

Looking closer:

- The medicine wheels are more specifically associated with Native American cultures, particularly in North America.

- The examples are all in North America, while the anti-examples are in the British Isles.

- The medicine wheels often have a central cairn with spokes, whereas the stone circles in the anti-examples are more circular arrangements without spokes.

So, perhaps the specific theme is "North American ceremonial stone structures with radial or wheel-like features," as opposed to the more circular stone circles in the British Isles.

With that in mind, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **Rollright Stones**: Located in England, this is a complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments, including a circle of stones known as the King's Men and a tall single standing stone called the King Stone. It doesn't have the radial or wheel-like features of the medicine wheels. So, it's more similar to the anti-examples. Score: 1

2. **Newark Earthworks**: These are ancient earthworks located in Newark, Ohio, built by the Hopewell culture. They include geometric enclosures and mounds. While they are North American and have ceremonial significance, they are earthworks rather than stone structures. However, they do have geometric patterns, which might be similar to the circular and radial features of the medicine wheels. Score: 4

3. **Serpent Mound**: Also in Ohio, this is a large effigy mound in the shape of a serpent. It's associated with the Fort Ancient people. It's North American and has ceremonial significance, but it's not a stone structure and doesn't have radial features. Score: 2

4. **Stonehenge**: Located in England, it's a famous prehistoric monument composed of a ring of standing stones. It has astronomical alignments but is more similar to the anti-examples. Score: 1

5. **Woodhenge (England)**: This is a Neolithic timber circle, part of the Durrington Walls complex near Stonehenge. Again, it's in England and doesn't have the radial features of the medicine wheels. Score: 1

6. **Newgrange**: A prehistoric monument in Ireland, built during the Neolithic period, it's a large circular mound with an inner chamber. It's similar to the anti-examples in terms of location and type. Score: 1

7. **Cahokia Woodhenge**: This is a series of wooden post circles discovered at the Cahokia Mounds site in Illinois, USA. It's North American and has a circular arrangement, similar to some medicine wheels. Score: 6

8. **Carnac stones**: These are a collection of over 3,000 prehistoric standing stones located in Brittany, France. They include alignments, dolmens, tumuli, and single menhirs. While they are ancient stone structures, they are not North American and don't have the radial features. Score: 1

So, based on this analysis, the scores are:

- Rollright Stones: 1

- Newark Earthworks: 4

- Serpent Mound: 2

- Stonehenge: 1

- Woodhenge (England): 1

- Newgrange: 1

- Cahokia Woodhenge: 6

- Carnac stones: 1

I need to make sure that I'm using the full range of scores, but in this case, most of the candidates don't closely match the specific theme, except for Cahokia Woodhenge, which gets a higher score due to its North American location and circular arrangement.

**Final Scores:**

- 1: 1

- 2: 4

- 3: 2

- 4: 1

- 5: 1

- 6: 1

- 7: 6

- 8: 1
