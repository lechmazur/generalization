Alright, I've got this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on a specific theme derived from the examples provided, and make sure I don't get misled by the anti-examples. Let's start by understanding the theme from the examples.

First, there's a gel stress ball that deforms when squeezed and returns to its original shape when released. Then, there's a spring-loaded door stopper that compresses under pressure and springs back. Lastly, a retractable pen that extends and retracts with clicks. So, the common thread here seems to be objects that change shape or position in response to an action and then return to their original state when that action is removed or reversed.

Now, looking at the anti-examples: a metal that changes shape when heated and stays that way when cooled; clay that can be molded but doesn't return; plastic toy that bends when heated and stays bent. These seem to involve permanent shape changes after certain actions, unlike the examples where the shape change is temporary and reversible.

So, the specific theme appears to be objects that temporarily deform or change position in response to an action and then spontaneously return to their original state when that action is removed. Key points: temporary deformation, spontaneous return to original state.

With that in mind, let's evaluate each candidate.

Candidate 1: A metal spring that compresses under weight but doesn't return if overstretched.

Hmm, so it compresses and would normally return, but if overstretched, it doesn't. This suggests that within its normal limits, it behaves like the examples, but beyond that, it doesn't return. So, partially matches the theme, but with a caveat about overstretching.

Score: 7 (it matches the theme under normal conditions, but the condition about overstretching introduces a limitation).

Candidate 2: A memory foam pillow that contours to the head and returns to its original shape.

This sounds similar to the stress ball and door stopper. It deforms under pressure (or body heat) and returns to its original shape when the pressure is removed. Seems like a good match.

Score: 9 (very similar to the examples).

Candidate 3: A candle that melts when lit but doesn't return to its original shape when cooled.

Melting is a phase change from solid to liquid, and it doesn't return to the original shape naturally. This is more like the anti-examples where the shape change is permanent.

Score: 2 (poor match; shape change is permanent).

Candidate 4: A piece of paper that can be crumpled but doesn't smooth out automatically.

Crumpling paper deforms it, but it doesn't return to its original shape spontaneously. You have to smooth it out manually, if at all. So, it doesn't meet the spontaneous return criterion.

Score: 3 (partial match because it deforms, but doesn't return spontaneously).

Candidate 5: A wooden plank that bends under weight but doesn't return.

Similar to candidate 4. It deforms under pressure but doesn't return spontaneously. So, not a good match.

Score: 2 (poor match).

Candidate 6: A glass that shatters when dropped and can't return.

Completely irreversible change. No return to original state at all.

Score: 0 (no match).

Candidate 7: A metal wire that can be bent into different shapes but doesn't return.

Again, permanent deformation. Doesn't fit the theme.

Score: 1 (very poor match).

Candidate 8: A piece of ice that melts into water and doesn't return to solid form.

Melting is a phase change, and without freezing, it doesn't return to its original state. So, not a match.

Score: 1 (very poor match).

Wait a minute, but ice can return to its solid form if frozen again, but the description says "cannot return to its solid form," which might imply that once melted, it stays as water. However, in reality, ice can be refrozen, but perhaps in this context, it's considered a permanent change.

But based on the given description, it's a 1, same as candidate 7.

Alright, summarizing the scores:

1. 7

2. 9

3. 2

4. 3

5. 2

6. 0

7. 1

8. 1

I think this grading reflects how well each candidate matches the specific theme of temporary deformation with spontaneous return to original state,区别于那些形状变化是永久性的或者需要外部干预才能恢复的物体。
