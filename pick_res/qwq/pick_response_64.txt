Alright, I have this task here where I need to evaluate some candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from three examples, but avoid matching broader or related themes that are represented by anti-examples. The examples given are:

1. The Maya numeral system

2. The vigesimal counting system used by the Aztecs

3. The base-20 number system used in some Papua New Guinean languages

And the anti-examples are:

1. The decimal system

2. The binary system

3. The hexadecimal system

So, first, I need to understand what the specific theme is here. All three examples are numeral systems or counting systems that use base-20, also known as vigesimal systems. The Maya, Aztecs, and some Papua New Guinean cultures all used this base-20 system for their numeracy.

The anti-examples, on the other hand, are other positional numeral systems: decimal (base-10), binary (base-2), and hexadecimal (base-16). So, it's important to note that while all these are positional numeral systems, the specific theme is base-20 systems, and the anti-examples are other base systems.

Therefore, the theme here is "base-20 numeral systems used in specific cultures."

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they match this specific theme, avoiding broader categories that might include other base systems.

Let's look at each candidate one by one.

Candidate 1: The traditional counting method of the Yoruba people

I need to research or recall what base the Yoruba counting method uses. The Yoruba people are from Nigeria and have a numeral system. I believe their system is based on 20, similar to the Maya and Aztecs. So, this would be a good match for the theme.

Score: 8

Candidate 2: The octal system

The octal system is base-8, which is different from base-20. So, this doesn't match the specific theme.

Score: 2

Candidate 3: The Roman numeral system

Roman numerals are based on base-10, not base-20. So, this is not a match for the specific theme.

Score: 1

Candidate 4: The Arabic numeral system

The Arabic numeral system is also base-10, which is different from base-20.

Score: 1

Candidate 5: The Babylonian numeral system

The Babylonian numeral system is actually base-60, also known as sexagesimal. So, while it's a positional numeral system, it's not base-20.

Score: 2

Candidate 6: The Chinese numeral system

The Chinese numeral system is base-10, similar to the Arabic and Roman systems.

Score: 1

Candidate 7: The sexagesimal system used by the ancient Sumerians

Sexagesimal is base-60, which again is different from base-20.

Score: 2

Candidate 8: The duodecimal system

Duodecimal is base-12, which is not base-20.

Score: 2

Wait a minute, for candidate 1, I gave it an 8, but I need to think about whether it's a perfect match or not. The Maya, Aztecs, and Papua New Guinean languages all use base-20, and the Yoruba also use base-20, but I need to confirm that.

Upon checking, yes, the Yoruba numeral system is indeed based on 20. However, there might be some differences in how they represent numbers or their cultural usage, but the base is 20, which matches the theme.

So, an 8 seems appropriate, considering it's a match but might have some differences in implementation or cultural specifics.

For the other candidates, since they are not base-20 systems, they don't match the specific theme. I've given them scores of 1 or 2, depending on how close they are to base-20. For example, base-12 (duodecimal) is closer to base-20 than base-8 (octal), but neither matches the specific theme.

But in this case, since the theme is strictly base-20, any deviation from that base should receive a lower score.

Therefore, the final scores are:

1. 8

2. 2

3. 1

4. 1

5. 2

6. 1

7. 2

8. 2

**Final Output:**

<number>1</number><score>8</score>

<number>2</number><score>2</score>

<number>3</number><score>1</score>

<number>4</number><score>1</score>

<number>5</number><score>2</score>

<number>6</number><score>1</score>

<number>7</number><score>2</score>

<number>8</number><score>2</score>
