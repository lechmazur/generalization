Alright, I have this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on a specific theme derived from the initial examples, and make sure not to get influenced by the anti-examples. Let's start by understanding the theme from the examples provided.

First, there's the capture of the first black hole image by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019. Then, the observation of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012, and the discovery of exoplanets using the Kepler Space Telescope in the early 21st century. So, these are all about重大科学发现，涉及到宇宙、粒子物理和天文学等领域。它们都是通过先进的技术手段实现的突破性发现。

Now, the anti-examples are the mapping of the human genome in 2003, the discovery of DNA's structure in 1953, and the discovery of X-rays in 1895. These also sound like significant scientific achievements, but they don't fit the specific theme. So, perhaps the theme is more narrow than just "major scientific discoveries."

Looking closer, the examples all involve the observation or detection of phenomena in the universe or at the subatomic level, using large-scale experimental setups or telescopes. The anti-examples, while also significant, might be more about biological discoveries or the discovery of new types of radiation.

So, maybe the theme is "discoveries in astrophysics and particle physics using large collaborative experiments or telescopes."

With that in mind, let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Invention of the telescope by Galileo in the 17th century.**

   - This is about the invention of a tool, not directly a discovery in astrophysics or particle physics. Although Galileo used the telescope to make discoveries, the act of inventing the telescope is different from the theme, which seems to focus on the discoveries themselves.

   - Score: 2

2. **Detection of gravitational waves by LIGO in 2015.**

   - This fits very well with the theme. It's a major astrophysical discovery using a large-scale experimental setup, similar to the Event Horizon Telescope and the Large Hadron Collider.

   - Score: 9

3. **Discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928.**

   - This is a biological discovery, which is significant but doesn't fit the astrophysics/particle physics theme.

   - Score: 1

4. **Discovery of the neutron in 1932.**

   - The discovery of the neutron is a particle physics discovery, which aligns well with the theme.

   - Score: 8

5. **Discovery of radioactivity by Marie Curie in the late 19th century.**

   - Radioactivity is a fundamental discovery in physics, but it's more related to nuclear physics than particle physics or astrophysics. It's somewhat related but not as directly aligned with the theme.

   - Score: 5

6. **First successful cloning of a mammal, Dolly the sheep, in 1996.**

   - This is a biological achievement, not related to physics or astronomy.

   - Score: 0

7. **Discovery of the electron in 1897.**

   - The discovery of the electron is a foundational particle physics discovery, similar to the Higgs boson.

   - Score: 8

8. **First moon landing in 1969.**

   - This is an engineering achievement and a milestone in space exploration, but it's not a scientific discovery in the same vein as the examples provided.

   - Score: 3

So, summarizing the scores:

- 1: 2

- 2: 9

- 3: 1

- 4: 8

- 5: 5

- 6: 0

- 7: 8

- 8: 3
