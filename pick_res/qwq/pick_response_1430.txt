Alright, I've got this task here. There are three examples: jadeite, hematite, and iron pyrite. Then there are three anti-examples: turquoise, silver, and gold. And finally, there are eight candidates that I need to score from 0 to 10 based on how well they match the specific theme of the examples, without matching the broader or related themes that the anti-examples might represent.

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the examples and anti-examples. Let's look at the examples:

1. Jadeite: That's a variety of jade, which is a mineral. It's known for its green color and is used in jewelry and ornamental objects.

2. Hematite: This is an iron oxide mineral, known for its silver to black color. It's been used historically in various applications, including as a pigment.

3. Iron pyrite: Also known as fool's gold, it's an iron sulfide mineral. It has a metallic luster and cubic crystal structure.

Now, the anti-examples:

1. Turquoise: Another mineral, known for its blue-to-green color. It's used in jewelry and ornamentation, similar to jadeite.

2. Silver: A metallic element, often used in jewelry and currency.

3. Gold: Similarly, a precious metal used in jewelry, currency, and various applications.

From these, it seems like the examples are all minerals with specific properties, used in various applications, while the anti-examples include other minerals and metals that are also used similarly.

So, the theme isn't just "minerals used in jewelry," because both examples and anti-examples fit that. It might be more specific.

Let me think about the characteristics of the examples:

- Jadeite: mineral, used in jewelry and ornamentation, specific color.

- Hematite: mineral, used in pigments, specific color.

- Iron pyrite: mineral, used in various applications, metallic luster.

Anti-examples:

- Turquoise: mineral, used in jewelry, different color.

- Silver: metal, used in jewelry and currency.

- Gold: metal, used in jewelry and currency.

Maybe the theme is "minerals that are not metals, with specific colors or properties, used in decorative or functional applications."

Turquoise is a mineral used in jewelry, similar to jadeite, but perhaps it's excluded because it's a different color or has different properties.

Silver and gold are metals, not minerals in the same sense as the examples, which are mineral compounds.

So, perhaps the theme is "non-metallic mineral compounds used in specific applications, often decorative, with particular color or luster properties."

With that in mind, let's look at the candidates:

1. Obsidian: This is a type of natural glass, usually black, formed from rapidly cooled lava. It was used historically in tools and ornamentation. It's not a metal, and it has specific properties and colors. So, it seems to fit the theme well.

2. Azurite: This is a blue mineral, a carbonate of copper. It's been used as a blue pigment and in jewelry. It matches the profile of being a non-metallic mineral with specific color and uses.

3. Copper: This is a metal, similar to silver and gold. While it's used in various applications, including jewelry and currency, it might be excluded based on the anti-examples.

4. Cocoa beans: These are seeds from the cacao tree, used to make chocolate. They're not minerals at all, so they don't fit the theme.

5. Malachite: This is a green mineral, a copper carbonate hydroxide. It's been used as a pigment and in jewelry. It seems similar to jadeite and azurite.

6. Cinnabar: This is a mineral that is the main source of mercury. It's red or mercury-colored and has been used as a pigment (vermilion). It's not a metal and has specific properties and uses.

7. Galena: This is a lead sulfide mineral, often used in the production of lead and other compounds. It has a metallic luster, similar to iron pyrite.

8. Salt: This is sodium chloride, a mineral used in various applications, including food preservation and seasoning. It's not a metal and has specific properties and uses.

Now, to score them from 0 to 10 based on how well they match the specific theme:

1. Obsidian: High match. Non-metallic mineral, specific properties and uses. Score: 9

2. Azurite: High match. Non-metallic mineral, specific color and uses. Score: 9

3. Copper: Metal, similar to anti-examples. Doesn't fit the specific theme. Score: 1

4. Cocoa beans: Not a mineral at all. Doesn't fit the theme. Score: 0

5. Malachite: High match. Non-metallic mineral, specific color and uses. Score: 9

6. Cinnabar: High match. Non-metallic mineral, specific color and uses. Score: 8

7. Galena: Non-metallic mineral, but used primarily for lead extraction. Less similar to the examples. Score: 5

8. Salt: Non-metallic mineral, widely used, but different properties and uses compared to the examples. Score: 4

So, the final scores are:

<number>1</number><score>9</score>

<number>2</number><score>9</score>

<number>3</number><score>1</score>

<number>4</number><score>0</score>

<number>5</number><score>9</score>

<number>6</number><score>8</score>

<number>7</number><score>5</score>

<number>8</number><score>4</score>

I think this grading reflects how well each candidate matches the specific theme based on the examples and anti-examples provided.
