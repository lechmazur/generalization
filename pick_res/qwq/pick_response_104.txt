Alright, I've got this task here. I need to evaluate these candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from the examples provided, but not match the broader or related themes that the anti-examples represent. The examples are Uluru/Ayers Rock in Australia, Mount Kailash in Tibet, and Bear Butte in South Dakota. The anti-examples are Mount Sinai, The Grand Canyon, and Giant's Causeway.

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples. Let's look at each one:

1. Uluru/Ayers Rock: It's a large sandstone rock formation in Australia, sacred to the Pitjantjatjara people.

2. Mount Kailash: A peak in the Himalayas, considered a sacred place in several religions including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

3. Bear Butte: A small isolated mountain in South Dakota, sacred to the Native American tribes in the region.

So, they are all natural landforms that hold significant cultural or religious importance.

Now, the anti-examples:

1. Mount Sinai: A mountain in Egypt, significant in Abrahamic religions as the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments.

2. The Grand Canyon: A large canyon in Arizona, USA, famous for its size and the exposed layers of ancient geological history.

3. Giant's Causeway: An area of about 40,000 interlocking basalt columns in Northern Ireland, formed by volcanic activity.

Mount Sinai is also a sacred site, similar to the examples, so maybe the theme isn't just about sacred sites. The Grand Canyon is a natural wonder with geological significance, and Giant's Causeway is also a natural formation with geological importance.

Hmm, so perhaps the specific theme is about natural landforms that are sacred or have spiritual significance to certain cultures, but not those that are primarily known for their geological or historical significance in a broader context.

Wait, Mount Kailash is also a site of pilgrimage and has religious significance, similar to Mount Sinai. So maybe it's not just about sacred sites, but something more specific.

Let me think differently. All three examples are specific landforms that are isolated or distinct in their regions, not part of a larger mountain range or canyon system.

Uluru is an isolated rock formation, Mount Kailash is a distinct peak, and Bear Butte is a small isolated mountain.

The anti-examples include Mount Sinai, which is also a distinct mountain, The Grand Canyon, which is a large canyon system, and Giant's Causeway, which is a unique geological feature.

Maybe the theme is about sites that are not only sacred but also have a unique geographical feature that stands out in their landscape.

But Giant's Causeway is also a unique geological feature, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is about sites that are sacred to indigenous or local cultures, rather than having a more universal or widely recognized religious significance.

Uluru is sacred to the Aboriginal Australians, Mount Kailash to multiple Asian religions, and Bear Butte to Native American tribes.

Mount Sinai is significant in Abrahamic religions, which have broader global followings.

So, maybe the specific theme is about sites that are sacred to indigenous or local cultures, as opposed to having a wider, more universally recognized religious significance.

Let's consider that hypothesis.

Another perspective: all three examples are natural formations without significant human alterations, whereas the anti-examples might include human-made structures or more extensively modified natural sites.

Wait, Giant's Causeway is a natural formation, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is about sites that are not as commercially developed or tourist-oriented as some of the anti-examples.

But that seems a bit vague.

Let me look for another commonality.

All three examples are sites that require a pilgrimage or are held in high spiritual regard by certain cultures.

Similarly, Mount Sinai is also a pilgrimage site, so that might not distinguish them.

Wait, perhaps the specific theme is about sites that are both sacred and have a strong connection to the earth or geological features, often considered as embodiments or residences of deities or spiritual entities in local beliefs.

Uluru is considered sacred by Aboriginal Australians and has spiritual significance in their creation stories.

Mount Kailash is considered the abode of Lord Shiva in Hinduism and has spiritual significance in Buddhism and Jainism as well.

Bear Butte is sacred to the Lakota people and other Native American tribes, used for vision quests and other spiritual ceremonies.

In contrast, Mount Sinai is significant as the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments, more of a historical event in religious narratives.

The Grand Canyon is a natural wonder with geological importance but not necessarily held as a sacred site in the same way.

Giant's Causeway has mythological significance in Irish folklore but may not be considered a sacred site for religious practices.

So, perhaps the theme is about natural landforms that are considered sacred and are central to the spiritual beliefs or practices of indigenous or local cultures, possibly being seen as dwelling places of deities or having a central role in creation myths.

With that in mind, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Victoria Falls: It's a spectacular waterfall on the Zambezi River, forming a natural border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It's known for its beauty and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has spiritual significance to the local tribes, such as the Tonga people, who consider it a sacred site.

Given that it's a natural formation with spiritual significance to local cultures, it seems to match the theme quite well.

Score: 8

2. The Great Pyramid of Giza: It's an ancient Egyptian pyramid located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo. It was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu and is one of the most famous monuments in the world.

This is a human-made structure, not a natural landform, so it doesn't fit the theme.

Score: 0

3. Stonehenge: It's a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England, consisting of a ring of standing stones. Its purpose is subject to debate, but it's believed to have had some ritual or astronomical significance.

Again, this is a human-made structure, not a natural landform.

Score: 0

4. Niagara Falls: It's a group of three waterfalls on the Niagara River, forming the boundary between the United States and Canada. It's a popular tourist destination and has cultural significance to the indigenous peoples of the region.

Similar to Victoria Falls, it's a natural formation with cultural and spiritual significance to local indigenous peoples.

Score: 7

5. Angel Falls: It's the world's highest uninterrupted waterfall, located in Venezuela. It's named after Jimmie Angel, a US aviator who was the first to fly over it.

It's a natural formation and, while it may have local cultural significance, information about its spiritual importance is less prominent compared to the examples.

Score: 6

6. Mount Everest: It's the highest mountain on Earth, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. It's on the border between Nepal and China. It's a popular destination for mountaineers and has cultural significance in the region.

Mount Everest is considered sacred by some local cultures, and in Buddhism, it is believed to be the abode of a goddess.

Given its sacred significance and status as a natural landform, it seems to match the theme.

Score: 9

7. Mount Fuji in Japan: It's an active stratovolcano and the highest mountain in Japan. It's a symbol of Japan and holds significant cultural and historical importance. It's also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Mount Fuji is considered sacred in Shintoism and has been an object of worship for centuries. It's a natural landform with deep spiritual and cultural significance.

Score: 9

8. Easter Island Statues: They are monolithic human figures carved by the Rapa Nui people on Easter Island in Chile. They are known as moai and are important to the cultural heritage of the Rapa Nui.

These are human-made statues, not natural landforms, so they don't fit the theme.
