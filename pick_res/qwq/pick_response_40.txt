Alright, I have this task to evaluate these candidates based on a specific theme related to Reformed Epistemology, specifically how religious beliefs can be considered properly basic and accepted as rational without needing evidential support. The examples given were a television series, a play, and a film that all focus on this idea in different ways.

Now, the anti-examples are things that touch on faith or religion but don't specifically address Reformed Epistemology. So, I need to make sure I'm not just looking for anything that involves faith, but specifically things that align with the idea of faith being properly basic and not requiring justification through reason or evidence.

Let me think about each candidate one by one.

Candidate 1: A novel where the protagonist's journey to faith is portrayed as a basic, non-inferential belief, central to the plot.

This seems pretty close to the theme. It mentions that the belief is non-inferential, which aligns with the idea of properly basic beliefs in Reformed Epistemology. The fact that it's central to the plot suggests that the narrative arc focuses on this acceptance of faith without needing evidential support. So, this seems like a good match.

Candidate 2: A book that discusses the philosophy of religion in general terms.

This is broader than the specific theme. While it might touch on Reformed Epistemology, it's not necessarily focusing on it. It could be discussing various aspects of philosophy of religion without emphasizing the properly basic nature of faith. So, this is more of a general treatment and not specifically aligned with the theme.

Candidate 3: A film that portrays the journey of a character converting to a new religion without addressing epistemological issues.

Here, the focus is on the conversion journey, but it doesn't address the epistemological aspects, specifically whether the belief is properly basic or not. So, it's dealing with religion and belief, but not in the specific way defined by the theme.

Candidate 4: A television show that portrays various religious beliefs but does not focus on the rationality of belief without evidence.

This seems similar to candidate 3. It's about portraying different religious beliefs, but without focusing on the rationality of holding those beliefs without evidence, which is key to the theme.

Candidate 5: A book that explores the concept of belief in general, without specific reference to Reformed Epistemology.

Again, this is too broad. It's about belief in general, not specifically about religious beliefs being properly basic and accepted as rational without evidential support.

Candidate 6: A novel where characters debate the existence of God using traditional arguments.

This seems to be more about theistic proofs and classical arguments for God's existence, which is different from Reformed Epistemology's focus on faith being properly basic. So, it's dealing with the rationality of belief in God, but through different means than the theme specifies.

Candidate 7: A film that focuses on the personal journey of faith without referencing any specific epistemological framework.

This is similar to candidate 1, but it doesn't specify that the faith is non-inferential or properly basic. It's about a personal journey of faith, which could involve various aspects, but without the specific focus on the epistemology of faith as per the theme.

Candidate 8: A book that discusses the role of faith in personal development without referencing Reformed Epistemology.

This seems to be more about the practical effects of faith on personal growth, rather than addressing the epistemological status of faith. So, it's related but not matching the specific theme.

Alright, now to assign scores from 0 to 10 based on how well each candidate matches the specific theme.

Candidate 1 seems like a strong match because it specifically mentions non-inferential belief, which aligns with properly basic beliefs. So, I'll give it a 9.

Candidate 2 is too broad, discussing philosophy of religion generally without focusing on Reformed Epistemology. So, it gets a 2.

Candidate 3 is about conversion without addressing epistemological issues, so it's not a good match. Score: 1.

Candidate 4 is similar to candidate 3, portraying various beliefs without focusing on the rationality without evidence. Score: 1.

Candidate 5 is about belief in general, not specifically religious beliefs being properly basic. Score: 2.

Candidate 6 involves debates about God's existence using traditional arguments, which is different from the focus on faith being properly basic. Score: 3.

Candidate 7 is about a personal journey of faith without specifying the epistemological framework, so it's a partial match. Score: 4.

Candidate 8 discusses the role of faith in personal development without referencing Reformed Epistemology, so it's related but not a direct match. Score: 3.

So, the scores are:

1. 9

2. 2

3. 1

4. 1

5. 2

6. 3

7. 4

8. 3

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{1:9,\ 2:2,\ 3:1,\ 4:1,\ 5:2,\ 6:3,\ 7:4,\ 8:3} \]
