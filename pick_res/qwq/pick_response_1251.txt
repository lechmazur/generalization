Alright, I have this task to evaluate these candidates based on a specific theme derived from the examples provided, and to avoid being misled by the anti-examples. Let's start by understanding what the specific theme is from the examples given.

The Didgeridoo is a traditional Australian instrument that has gained worldwide recognition and is used in various music genres. The Polynesian outrigger canoe is a design that has influenced modern sailing and boat-building techniques globally. The Maori Haka is a traditional war dance that has been adopted and recognized worldwide in sports and cultural performances.

So, the common thread here seems to be traditional cultural elements or innovations from specific regions that have had global influence and adoption in various fields such as music, sports, and culture.

Now, looking at the anti-examples: the printing press, compass, and steam engine. These are all significant inventions or innovations that have had profound impacts on human history, particularly in areas like knowledge dissemination, navigation, and industrialization. However, they don't seem to fit the specific theme of being traditional cultural elements that have been globally adopted in a similar cultural or recreational context.

So, the specific theme I'm focusing on is: traditional cultural elements or innovations from specific regions that have been globally adopted and influential in cultural, recreational, or artistic fields.

With that in mind, let's evaluate each candidate:

1. The telescope: It's an instrument that has advanced our understanding of the universe. While it's a significant scientific invention, it's not a traditional cultural element from a specific region that has been globally adopted in a cultural or recreational context. It's more of a scientific tool used universally for astronomy. So, this seems more akin to the anti-examples like the printing press or the steam engineâ€”important for scientific advancement but not fitting the specific theme of traditional cultural elements with global cultural influence.

Score: 1

2. The Inuit kayak: Originally designed for hunting and transportation in the Arctic, which has influenced modern recreational and competitive kayaking globally. This seems very similar to the Polynesian outrigger canoe example. It's a traditional design from a specific culture that has been adopted and influential in modern sports and recreation worldwide.

Score: 9

3. The electric light bulb: An invention that has transformed daily life and work. Like the printing press or the steam engine, it's a groundbreaking invention with widespread practical applications but not a traditional cultural element that has been globally adopted in a cultural context.

Score: 0

4. The wheel: An ancient invention that has been fundamental to transportation and machinery. It's a foundational innovation that has had profound impacts across cultures and civilizations but isn't a traditional cultural element in the sense of being a specific regional practice or artifact that has been adopted globally in a cultural or recreational way.

Score: 2

5. The bicycle: A mode of transportation that has influenced urban planning and personal mobility. While it has global influence and is used recreationally, it's more of a modern invention that has become ubiquitous rather than a traditional cultural element from a specific region that has been adopted globally.

Score: 3

6. The radio: A device that transformed communication and entertainment. It's a significant technological invention that has had global impact but doesn't fit the specific theme of being a traditional cultural element from a particular region that has been adopted globally in a cultural or recreational context.

Score: 0

7. The microscope: An instrument that has advanced scientific research and medical diagnostics. Similar to the telescope, it's a scientific tool with global importance but doesn't align with the specific theme of traditional cultural elements with global cultural influence.

Score: 1

8. The airplane: A revolutionary mode of transportation that has connected the world. While it has global influence and is used worldwide, it's a modern invention and not a traditional cultural element from a specific region that has been adopted globally in a cultural or recreational way.

Score: 2

So, summarizing the scores:

- Telescope: 1

- Inuit kayak: 9

- Electric light bulb: 0

- Wheel: 2

- Bicycle: 3

- Radio: 0

- Microscope: 1

- Airplane: 2

I've tried to be nuanced in my scoring, using the full range from 0 to 9, to reflect how closely each candidate matches the specific theme identified from the examples.
