Alright, I've got this task here. It seems a bit tricky, but I'll try my best to understand it and complete it correctly. So, there are three examples given that represent a specific theme, and three anti-examples that don't match that specific theme but could be related in a broader sense. My job is to evaluate eight candidates against that specific theme and assign each a score from 0 to 10 based on how well they match it, excluding any matches based on broader or related themes.

First, I need to identify what the specific theme is from the three examples provided:

1. Elizabeth Eckford attempting to enter Little Rock Central High in 1957.

2. The Tank Man standing before tanks in Tiananmen Square in 1989.

3. James Meredith walking onto the University of Mississippi campus in 1962.

These all seem to be instances where individuals stood up against significant opposition or authority in a moment of historical importance. They are acts of defiance or protest that had substantial impact on social or political issues.

Now, looking at the anti-examples:

1. The first sit-in at Woolworth's lunch counter.

2. Susan B. Anthony voting illegally.

3. The Storming of the Bastille.

These also involve acts of protest or defiance, but perhaps differ in some key aspects from the specific theme represented by the first three examples.

So, maybe the specific theme is more about individual acts of defiance against authority or established systems, where the individual is standing alone or as a lone figure against a larger force, capturing a pivotal moment in time.

Comparatively, the anti-examples might involve group actions or the beginning of larger movements, which, while related, are not exactly the same as the specific theme.

With that in mind, I need to evaluate each of the eight candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme of individual acts of defiance against authority, captured in a pivotal moment.

Let's look at each candidate one by one.

Candidate 1: Gandhi's Salt March.

Mohandas Gandhi leading the Salt March in 1930 was a act of civil disobedience against British rule in India. While it was a powerful act of defiance, it was not an individual act since it involved thousands of people marching with him. So, while it's a significant act of protest, it doesn't fit the specific theme of an individual standing alone against authority. Therefore, I would give it a low score, maybe a 2.

Candidate 2: The Montgomery Bus Boycott.

This was a mass protest in Montgomery, Alabama, against segregated bus services. It was a collective action organized by the African American community, led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr. Again, while it was a powerful protest, it wasn't an individual act of defiance. So, similar to the Salt March, I'll give it a 2.

Candidate 3: The Stonewall Riots.

These were a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the LGBTQ+ community in response to a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in 1969. While there were individual acts of resistance, the riots were a collective uprising. Therefore, not a perfect match for the specific theme, but perhaps closer than the previous two candidates because it involved individual acts within a larger context. I'll give it a 4.

Candidate 4: Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat in Montgomery in 1955.

This is a classic example of an individual act of defiance against racial segregation. Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger was a pivotal moment that sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. This seems very similar to the examples provided, as it was an individual standing up against authority in a moment that had significant historical impact. So, I'll give this a high score, perhaps a 9.

Candidate 5: Women's Suffrage Parade of 1913.

This was a large protest in support of women's voting rights in the United States. While it was a significant act of defiance, it was a group event with many participants. Therefore, it doesn't fit the specific theme of an individual acting against authority. I'll give it a 2.

Candidate 6: The Fall of the Berlin Wall.

The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 was a pivotal moment in German history and the Cold War, involving thousands of people tearing down the wall. It was a collective action, not an individual act of defiance. So, I'll give it a 1.

Candidate 7: The Boston Tea Party.

This was a political protest by colonists in Boston in 1773, who dumped tea into Boston Harbor to protest British taxes. While it was a significant act of defiance against British authority, it was carried out by a group of people, not an individual. Therefore, it doesn't fit the specific theme, and I'll give it a 2.

Candidate 8: The Selma to Montgomery March.

Also known as Bloody Sunday, this was a protest march in 1965 advocating for voting rights for African Americans. It was a mass demonstration led by civil rights leaders. Again, while it was a crucial moment in the civil rights movement, it wasn't an individual act of defiance. So, I'll give it a 2.

In summary, the candidates that best fit the specific theme of individual acts of defiance against authority in pivotal historical moments are Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her bus seat and, to a lesser extent, the Stonewall Riots, which involved individual acts within a larger context. The other candidates involve group actions or collective protests, which don't match the specific theme as closely.
