Alright, I have this task here where I need to evaluate these candidates based on a specific theme derived from the given examples, and make sure not to get influenced by the anti-examples. The examples provided are:

1. The Great Schism of 1054, splitting Christianity into Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches.

2. The formation of the Old Catholic Church after the First Vatican Council in 1870 due to disagreements over papal infallibility.

3. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, leading to the division of Western Christianity into Catholicism and Protestantism.

And the anti-examples are:

1. The split between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism.

2. The establishment of the Anglican Church under Henry VIII.

3. The founding of the Mormon Church.

From these, I need to identify the specific theme that applies to the examples but not to the anti-examples. Looking at the examples, they all seem to involve splits or divisions within existing Christian denominations due to theological disagreements or disputes over authority. The anti-examples, on the other hand, include splits within Buddhism, the establishment of Anglicanism for political reasons, and the founding of a entirely new religion in Mormonism.

So, the specific theme seems to be "schisms within Christianity due to theological disagreements or disputes over authority within the existing Christian tradition."

With that in mind, let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **The split between Sunni and Shia Islam following the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE.**

   - This is a split within Islam, not Christianity. So, it doesn't match the specific theme of Christian schisms due to theological disputes.

   - Score: 0

2. **The rise of the Jehovah's Witnesses in the late 19th century.**

   - Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination that broke away from the Bible Student movement. Their founding was based on theological differences and interpretations.

   - This seems similar to the examples provided, as it involves a division within Christianity based on theological disagreements.

   - Score: 8

3. **The formation of the Unitarian Universalist Association in the 20th century.**

   - Unitarian Universalism has its roots in Unitarianism and Universalism, both of which are Christian movements that diverged from mainstream Christianity due to theological differences.

   - Again, this seems akin to the examples, involving theological disagreements leading to a formal separation.

   - Score: 7

4. **The Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, which addressed theological disputes but did not result in a permanent division.**

   - This is a council that aimed to resolve theological disputes within Christianity, specifically the Arian controversy.

   - However, it didn't lead to a permanent split, which is a key aspect of the examples provided. The Great Schism, the formation of Old Catholic Church, and the Protestant Reformation all resulted in lasting divisions.

   - Since there was no permanent division, it doesn't fully match the theme.

   - Score: 2

5. **The rise of the Bahá'í Faith in the 19th century.**

   - Bahá'í is a separate religion that originated from Shi'a Islam. It's not a schism within Christianity.

   - Therefore, it doesn't fit the specific theme.

   - Score: 0

6. **The formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 19th century.**

   - Seventh-day Adventism is a Protestant Christian denomination that emerged from the Millerite movement.

   - Its formation was based on theological differences, particularly regarding the Sabbath and eschatology.

   - This matches the pattern of the examples, where theological disagreements led to the formation of a new Christian group.

   - Score: 9

7. **The rise of the Amish community in the 17th century.**

   - The Amish are a group that split from the Mennonites, who are themselves part of the Anabaptist tradition within Christianity.

   - The split was due to disagreements over disciplinary actions and the interpretation of biblical texts.

   - This aligns with the theme of theological disagreements leading to schisms within Christianity.

   - Score: 8

8. **The establishment of the Quaker movement in the 17th century.**

   - Quakerism, or the Religious Society of Friends, was founded by George Fox and others as a Christian movement emphasizing personal experience of God.

   - Its origins involved disagreements with established Christian practices and doctrines.

   - This seems similar to the examples, as it involves a theological disagreement leading to the formation of a new Christian group.

   - Score: 8

In summary, the candidates that best match the specific theme of schisms within Christianity due to theological disagreements or disputes over authority are those that involve divisions within Christianity where new denominations or groups form based on such disagreements. Candidates that involve splits within other religions or the establishment of new religions not stemming from theological disagreements within Christianity do not match the theme.
