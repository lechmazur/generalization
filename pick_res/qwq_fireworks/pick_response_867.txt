Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the given examples: fiber optic cables, satellite communication, and cellular networks. All three are modern, electronic methods of data or communication transmission. They all involve sending information over distances using technology that's part of the telecommunications infrastructure. 

Now, looking at the anti-examples: undersea cables, smoke signals, and semaphore flags. Undersea cables might seem similar to fiber optics, but they're a subset or a type of fiber optic cable, so maybe the specific theme excludes that? Wait, no. The anti-examples are supposed to be part of a broader theme but not the exact one. Undersea cables are a type of physical cable like fiber optics, but perhaps the theme is more about wireless vs wired? Hmm, but cellular networks and satellite are wireless, while fiber optics are wired. Maybe not that.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is about modern digital communication systems. Smoke signals and semaphore flags are ancient, so they're anti-examples. Undersea cables are still used today, so why are they anti? Maybe the specific theme is "modern digital communication systems that transmit data in real-time over long distances without physical medium"? Wait, fiber optics use physical cables, satellites use wireless, cellular uses wireless too. So maybe the theme is "telecommunication systems that use electromagnetic waves or light for data transmission"? 

Wait, undersea cables do use light (fiber optics), so that would make them part of the theme. But they are listed as an anti-example. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the specific theme is "modern, high-speed, digital communication systems that are part of the internet infrastructure"? Then undersea cables are part of the internet's backbone, so they should be examples. But they are anti-examples here. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the distinction.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "wireless communication technologies". Then fiber optic cables would be excluded, but they are examples. So that's not it. Let's think again.

Looking at the examples: fiber optic cables (physical, high-speed data), satellite (wireless, space-based), cellular (wireless, terrestrial). The commonality might be that they are all infrastructure components of modern telecommunications used for high-speed data transmission, part of the internet or mobile networks. 

The anti-examples: undersea cables are a type of fiber optic, so maybe the specific theme excludes undersea specifically? Not sure. Smoke signals and semaphore flags are pre-modern, so the theme might be "modern electronic communication systems". Undersea cables are modern, so that doesn't fit. Maybe the theme is "communication systems that operate in the air or space" excluding undersea? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "technologies that enable long-distance communication without physical connection", but fiber optics are physical. Hmm. Maybe the key is that all examples are part of the telecommunications infrastructure that's integral to the internet and mobile networks today. Undersea cables are part of that, so why are they anti-examples? Maybe the specific theme is "wireless communication technologies", but fiber optics are wired. That can't be.

Wait, maybe the anti-examples are part of a broader category but not the exact theme. The user says the anti-examples can follow a more general version of the theme or connected themes. So perhaps the specific theme is "modern, high-speed digital communication technologies using electromagnetic waves or fiber optics for data transmission as part of the internet or mobile infrastructure". Then undersea cables are a subset of fiber optics (which are examples), so why are they anti? Maybe the specific theme excludes undersea because they are a subset? Or perhaps the theme is "terrestrial wireless communication systems", so satellite is wireless but space-based, cellular is terrestrial wireless. But fiber optics are wired. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "communication systems that transmit data in the form of light or radio waves". Fiber optics use light, satellites use radio/microwaves, cellular uses radio. So that could be the common theme. Then undersea cables are fiber optics (light), so they should be examples but are anti-examples. Hmm, contradiction again.

Wait, perhaps the anti-examples are things that are part of the same category but not exactly the same. Undersea cables are a type of fiber optic cable, so maybe the specific theme is "above-ground or space-based communication systems", so undersea is excluded. Then fiber optics on land are included but undersea excluded. But that seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the examples are all digital, high-speed data networks, whereas undersea cables are part of that but the anti-examples are older tech. Wait, smoke signals and semaphore are old, but undersea cables are modern. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "technologies that transmit data using electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves, light) for digital communication", so fiber optics (light), satellites (microwave), cellular (radio). Undersea cables are fiber optics, so they should be examples but are anti. That's conflicting. Maybe the anti-examples are things that are part of a different aspect, like undersea cables are a subset but the theme is specifically about wireless? Then fiber optics would be excluded, but they are examples. 

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. The user says the anti-examples can match a broader theme but not the specific one. Let's consider the examples and anti-examples again:

Examples (theme):
1. Fiber optic cables - physical, high-speed, data
2. Satellite communication - wireless, space-based
3. Cellular networks - wireless, terrestrial

Anti-examples (broader theme):
1. Undersea cables - same as fiber optics but underwater, so maybe the specific theme excludes underwater? Or maybe it's about being part of the internet backbone vs not?
2. Smoke signals - pre-modern, non-electronic
3. Semaphore flags - also pre-modern

Maybe the specific theme is "modern, electronic, high-speed communication systems that form the backbone of internet and mobile networks". Undersea cables are part of that backbone, so why are they an anti-example? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "wireless communication systems", so fiber optics are excluded. But fiber is an example. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "communication systems that use light or radio waves for data transmission", which would include fiber optics (light), satellite (radio/microwave), cellular (radio). Undersea cables are fiber optics, so they should be included but are anti-examples. That's a problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the examples are all part of the internet's infrastructure, so undersea cables are part of that, but maybe the specific theme is "wireless components of internet infrastructure", excluding fiber. But fiber is an example here, so that's conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "communication systems that use electromagnetic waves (radio, light) for transmitting data, excluding physical cables". But fiber optics are physical cables using light, so they would be excluded, but they are examples. Not matching.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to see the anti-examples. The anti-examples include undersea cables (which are a type of fiber optic, so maybe the theme is not about being underwater), smoke signals (non-electronic), and semaphore (non-electronic). The examples are all electronic and modern. So the theme is "modern electronic communication systems". Undersea cables are modern and electronic, so they should be examples but are anti. That's a problem. 

Wait, perhaps the theme is "communication systems that transmit data in real-time over long distances using electromagnetic waves or fiber optics, forming part of the internet or mobile networks". Then undersea cables are part of that, so they should be examples, but they're anti-examples. Maybe the key is that the examples are all active systems (transmitters/receivers), while undersea cables are passive? No, they have repeaters. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "communication systems that operate in the air or space", so satellite (space), cellular (airwaves), fiber optics (on land but through cables). Wait, fiber is on the ground, so that might not fit. 

Alternatively, the theme could be "telecommunication systems that are part of the global internet infrastructure", which includes fiber, satellite, and cellular. Undersea cables are part of that, so again conflicting with anti-example. 

Perhaps I need to think of another angle. The examples all involve transmitting information through guided (fiber) or unguided (satellite, cellular) media. The anti-examples include undersea cables (guided), smoke (visual), semaphore (visual). Maybe the theme is "electronic communication systems using guided or unguided media for high-speed data", whereas anti-examples include non-electronic (smoke, semaphore) or perhaps undersea is considered a subset but the theme is more about the transmission method. 

Alternatively, the theme could be "modern digital communication systems that use electromagnetic waves or light for data transmission as part of the internet or mobile networks", and the anti-examples are either non-digital (smoke, semaphore) or a specific type that's part of a different category (undersea cables, which are a subset but maybe the theme is terrestrial vs underwater? Not sure). 

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are all part of the telecommunications infrastructure that's used for data in the context of the internet or mobile networks, whereas undersea cables are part of that but the anti-example is perhaps considered too broad. Alternatively, maybe the specific theme is "communication systems that use wireless technology for data transmission", so fiber is excluded but it's an example. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the examples are all examples of "telecommunication networks that are part of the internet backbone or mobile networks", but undersea cables are part of that. So perhaps the anti-examples are things that are part of the same category but not exactly the specific theme. Maybe the theme is "communication systems that use light (fiber) or radio waves (satellite/cellular) for high-speed data transmission as part of the internet infrastructure", and undersea cables are a subset but the anti-example is because they're a subset? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the specific theme is "communication systems that are wireless or use fiber optics for long-distance, high-speed data transmission". Undersea cables would fit, but they are anti-examples. This is confusing. 

Perhaps I should set aside the anti-examples for a moment and focus on the examples. The commonalities are:

- All are modern electronic systems.
- All are used for data transmission (communication, internet, etc.).
- They are infrastructure components (cables, satellites, cell towers).

The anti-examples include undersea cables (a type of fiber), which are similar to the first example, so maybe the specific theme is not including underwater, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the anti-examples might be older technologies (smoke, semaphore) and undersea cables are a subset but perhaps the theme is about being wireless. But fiber is wired. 

Alternatively, the theme is "communication technologies that enable high-speed data transfer over long distances, forming part of the internet's infrastructure", which would include all examples and undersea cables, but undersea is an anti-example. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "technologies that transmit data using electromagnetic waves (including light in fiber)", and the anti-examples include non-electromagnetic (smoke, semaphore) and undersea which is a subset but maybe the theme is about being wireless? 

Wait, maybe the examples are all "telecommunication systems that are part of the internet or mobile networks infrastructure", so fiber, satellite, cellular. The anti-examples include undersea (same as fiber, so why?), smoke and semaphore (old). Maybe the specific theme is "technologies that are currently in widespread use for high-speed data communication", but undersea cables are in use. 

Alternatively, maybe the key difference is that the examples are all technologies that are part of the internet's core infrastructure, while undersea cables are part of it but the theme is specifically about the transmission method (wireless vs wired). But fiber is wired, cellular is wireless, satellite is wireless. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "communication systems that use light (fiber) or radio waves (satellite/cellular) for data transmission". That would fit all examples. Undersea cables are fiber optics (light), so they should be examples but are anti-examples. That's conflicting. 

Wait, the user says the anti-examples can match a broader theme. So perhaps the specific theme is "modern digital communication systems that use light or radio waves for data transmission as part of the internet or mobile networks". Undersea cables are part of that, so they should be examples, but they are anti-examples. Therefore, maybe the specific theme is excluding undersea cables for some reason. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "communication systems that are wireless (satellite, cellular) or use fiber optics on land". Then undersea is a subset but the theme excludes underwater? That's possible but arbitrary. 

Alternatively, perhaps the anti-examples are part of a different aspect. For example, undersea cables are a type of fiber optic but the theme is specifically about "above-ground or space-based systems". So fiber on land is included, undersea excluded. That would make sense. So the theme is "communication systems that use light (fiber on land) or radio waves (satellite, cellular) for data transmission". Then undersea cables (fiber underwater) are excluded, making them an anti-example. That could be the case. 

Similarly, smoke signals and semaphore are non-electronic and not using light/radio in the same way. 

If that's the case, then the specific theme is "communication systems that use electromagnetic waves (radio) or light (fiber on land) for data transmission in above-ground or space environments". 

With that in mind, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Drums for communication: Non-electronic, uses sound. Not using light or radio. Score: 0 or 1. 

2. Internet routers: These are part of the infrastructure, use fiber and wireless, but are devices. The examples are the systems themselves (cables, satellites, cellular networks). Routers are part of the system, so maybe a 7 or 8? 

Wait, but the examples are the infrastructure elements (cables, satellites, networks). Routers are components within those networks. So maybe they're part of the theme. So perhaps a 9 or 10? Hmm. 

Wait, the examples are "fiber optic cables", "satellite communication", "cellular networks" — these are the systems. Routers are devices within those systems. So maybe the theme is the systems, not the components. So routers might be a lower score. 

Alternatively, if the theme includes devices that enable the systems, then routers would be a good fit. 

Hmm, tricky. Let's see other candidates first.

3. Television broadcasting: Uses radio waves or cable. But TV is broadcasting, not two-way data. The examples are data networks. So maybe lower score. Maybe 4-6?

4. Radio waves: The medium used by satellite and cellular. But radio waves themselves are a medium, not a system. The examples are systems that use them. So maybe 5?

5. Telegraph: Uses electrical signals over wires, older tech. Not digital. So lower score, maybe 2?

6. Light signals: Could refer to fiber optics (which are examples) or something like traffic lights. If it's general light signals, maybe 5?

7. Morse code: A signaling method, not a system. Used with telegraph or radio. So maybe 3?

8. Carrier pigeons: Non-electronic, physical. 0 or 1.

Wait, but let's reassess with the theme being "modern electronic communication systems using light or radio waves for data transmission as part of internet/mobile infrastructure".

Internet routers are definitely part of that. So maybe 9 or 10. 

Television broadcasting uses radio waves but is one-way, not part of internet/data. So maybe 4.

Radio waves as a medium: not a system, so lower. 3?

Telegraph is old tech, so 1.

Light signals: if referring to fiber, then 10, but as a general term (like visible light?), maybe 5.

Morse code is a protocol, not a system. 2.

Carrier pigeons: 0.

Drums: 0.

Hmm, but need to ensure the scores are nuanced and use the full range. Let me try to assign scores based on how closely they match the specific theme (modern electronic systems using light/radio for data as part of internet/mobile):

1. Drums: 0 (non-electronic, sound)
2. Routers: 9 (key component in the infrastructure)
3. TV: 4 (uses radio but one-way, not data networks)
4. Radio waves: 3 (medium, not a system)
5. Telegraph: 1 (old tech, electrical but not modern digital)
6. Light signals: 6 (if referring to fiber, but "light signals" could be broader, so maybe 6)
7. Morse code: 2 (protocol, outdated)
8. Carrier pigeons: 0 (non-electronic, physical)

Wait, but maybe light signals like traffic lights aren't part of data networks. If "light signals" is too vague, maybe 4?

Alternatively, if it's fiber optics (which are light signals), then 10, but as a term, it's ambiguous. Maybe 6.

Alternatively, the examples include fiber optic cables, so light signals via fiber are part of the theme. If the candidate is "light signals" in general, maybe it's a 7? 

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again:

- Internet routers: 9 (integral part of the systems)
- Radio waves: 3 (they're the medium, not the system)
- Light signals: 6 (assuming fiber optics, but the term is broader)
- TV: 4 (uses radio but not for data networks)
- Telegraph: 1 (old tech)
- Morse code: 2
- Drums: 0
- Carrier pigeons: 0

That uses a range from 0 to 9. Maybe adjust to include 10 for routers?

Alternatively, if routers are part of the infrastructure, maybe 10. Let me see:

1. 0
2. 10
3. 4
4. 3
5. 1
6. 7 (if light signals include fiber)
7. 2
8. 0

But need to ensure all scores are used. Let me try again with more granularity:

1. Drums: 0
2. Internet routers: 9 (key component but not the system itself)
3. TV: 3 (radio but not data)
4. Radio waves: 2 (medium)
5. Telegraph: 1
6. Light signals: 7 (if referring to fiber optics, which are examples)
7. Morse code: 2
8. Carrier pigeons: 0

Hmm, but Morse code and radio waves both 2. Maybe Morse is lower. Let's see:

Alternatively:

6. Light signals: 8 (since fiber is an example, and light signals could be part of that)
2. Routers: 9
Others as before. Then scores would be 0,9,3,2,1,8,2,0. 

Alternatively, the candidate "light signals" might not be exactly fiber optics. If it's visible light (like LEDs), that's a different tech, so maybe 5.

This is a bit tricky, but I'll proceed with the best possible assignments based on the theme I inferred.
