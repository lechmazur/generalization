Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples share. The given examples are Limestone Cove, Sandstone Point, and Granite City. Let's break them down.

Looking at each part: Limestone is a type of rock, and the second part is a geographical feature (Cove, Point, City). Wait, but "Granite City" is a bit different because "City" isn't a natural feature. Hmm, maybe the key is that all three examples combine a type of rock with a place name. Let me check the anti-examples to see what they don't include. The anti-examples are Basalt Ridge, Chalk Mountain, Shale Valley. These also combine a rock type with a geographical feature. Wait, so maybe the specific theme isn't just rock + place name?

Wait, perhaps the specific theme is that the rock types are sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic, but maybe there's a more specific classification. Let me think again. Limestone is sedimentary, Sandstone is also sedimentary, Granite is igneous. The anti-examples: Basalt is igneous, Chalk is sedimentary, Shale is sedimentary. Hmm, that doesn't separate them. Maybe the theme is that the rock names are more commonly used in place names? Or maybe the structure of the name?

Wait, another angle: the examples are all "Rock Type + Place Feature", but the anti-examples might have a different rock type category. Wait, maybe the specific theme is that the rock is a type that's used in geological formations for specific features. Alternatively, maybe the place names are more commonly associated with those rock types. Alternatively, perhaps the rock types in the examples are all composed of minerals that are more commonly found in certain structures. Alternatively, maybe the rock types are all types that are used in construction, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the first part is a type of rock that is a "stone" or "rock" ending, but that might not help. Wait, Limestone, Sandstone, Granite are all types of rock. The anti-examples: Basalt (igneous), Chalk (sedimentary), Shale (sedimentary). So the anti-examples also use rock types. So perhaps the theme is not the rock type category but something else.

Wait, looking at the examples again: Limestone Cove, Sandstone Point, Granite City. The structure is Rock + Feature. The anti-examples are Basalt Ridge, Chalk Mountain, Shale Valley. All follow the same structure. So maybe the specific theme is that the rock types in the examples are more commonly associated with the specific features? For instance, maybe limestone is often found in coves, sandstone in points, granite in cities (though cities are man-made). Hmm, that might not hold. Alternatively, maybe the rock types are all names that end with "-stone" except Granite? Wait, Limestone ends with "-stone", Sandstone with "-stone", Granite ends with "-ite". So perhaps the theme is that the rock types end with "-stone"? But then the anti-examples include Basalt (ends with "-alt"), Chalk (ends with "- chalk"), Shale (ends with "-ale"), so that would make the examples have "-stone" endings, which would be the theme. Let me check that.

If the theme is rock types ending with "-stone", then the examples fit (Limestone, Sandstone). Granite doesn't end with "-stone", but it's part of the examples. Hmm, that breaks it. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the rock types in the examples are all types that are used in place names more frequently? Or perhaps the rock is a type that is commonly associated with a certain geological feature. Let me think again. Maybe the key is that the first part of the name is a rock that is a "sedimentary" rock except for granite (which is igneous). But then the anti-examples include Basalt (igneous), which would be similar to Granite. So that might not separate them.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rock is a type that is a "sedimentary rock" or "metamorphic", but Granite is igneous. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: The examples all have the rock type as the first word, followed by a geographical feature. The anti-examples also do that. Maybe the specific theme is that the rock is a type that is a "clastic sedimentary rock"? Limestone is chemical sedimentary, sandstone is clastic. Granite is igneous. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the specific theme is that the rock is a type that is a "common" rock in place names. But that's too vague.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the rock names in the examples are all names that can be formed by adding a suffix to a mineral or a place. For instance, Limestone (limestone is a rock made of calcite), Sandstone (sand + stone), Granite (granum + ite). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the anti-examples, maybe the theme is that the rock is a "non-volcanic" rock? Basalt is volcanic. But Granite is intrusive igneous. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is that the rock is a type that is often used in construction, so Limestone, Sandstone, Granite are commonly used in building materials, while Basalt, Chalk, Shale might be less common? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rock names are all in the format of [Material] + [Place Feature], but the anti-examples might have a different material type. Wait, but Basalt is a rock. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the key is that the examples use rocks that are "hard" or "sedimentary/igneous" in a way that the anti-examples are softer or different? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the specific theme is that the rock types in the examples are all rocks that are formed in a certain way. Limestone is sedimentary, Sandstone is sedimentary, Granite is igneous. The anti-examples: Basalt (igneous), Chalk (sedimentary), Shale (sedimentary). So that doesn't differentiate. Maybe the theme is that the rock is a type that can form in large, visible structures. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the first part of the name is a rock that is a "stone" (like limestone, sandstone, granite as stones), while the anti-examples include minerals that are more like powdery or less solid? Chalk is soft, Shale is layered. Hmm, maybe the examples are harder rocks?

Alternatively, perhaps the specific theme is that the rock is a type that is a "common" or "well-known" rock in place names, while the anti-examples are less common. For instance, Basalt Ridge might be less common than Granite City? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the theme is that the rock is a type that is a "sedimentary rock" or "igneous rock" but not metamorphic? But Granite is igneous, Basalt is also igneous. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rock is a type that is used in the name of a city or a prominent feature, like "Granite City" is an actual city name. Similarly, "Sandstone Point" might be a real place. Maybe the examples are actual place names, while the anti-examples are fictional or less common? But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in the suffixes. Let me look again:

Examples:
- Limestone (suffix -stone)
- Sandstone (suffix -stone)
- Granite (ends with -ite)

Anti-examples:
- Basalt (ends with -alt)
- Chalk (ends with -chalk)
- Shale (ends with -ale)

Hmm, so two of the examples end with -stone, but Granite is -ite. So that might not be the pattern. Alternatively, maybe the first part is a rock type that is a "stone" (like limestone, sandstone) or a "granite" which is a rock. Maybe the anti-examples include rocks that are less commonly used in place names? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the theme is that the rock is a type that is a "rock" in the geological sense, as opposed to a mineral. But Basalt is a rock too. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the examples all have the rock type followed by a geographical feature that's a small or specific place, like Cove, Point, City. The anti-examples have Ridge, Mountain, Valley, which are larger features. But that might not be the case. A city is a human-made feature, which is different. So maybe the theme is that the rock is combined with a human-made feature (like City) or a specific small geographical feature (Cove, Point), whereas the anti-examples use larger natural features (Mountain, Valley, Ridge). But then "Granite City" is a city, which is human-made, but the others are natural. Hmm, maybe the theme is that the rock is combined with a place name that's a proper noun? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the specific theme is that the rock types in the examples are all rocks that can form in a way that allows them to be part of coastal or specific geographical features. For example, Limestone coves might be common where limestone erodes, forming coves. Sandstone points could form from erosion. Granite cities might be areas where granite is prevalent. But Basalt ridges are common in volcanic areas, so that might not separate them.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the examples use rock types that are "sedimentary" or "igneous" but not metamorphic? But Granite is igneous, Basalt is also igneous. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the theme is that the rock names in the examples are all types that are named after their mineral composition. Limestone (calcium carbonate), Sandstone (sand grains), Granite (feldspar, quartz, mica). The anti-examples: Basalt (mineral composition), Chalk (calcium carbonate like limestone but softer), Shale (clay minerals). Not sure that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is that the rock types in the examples are all rocks that are commonly used in the names of places in English-speaking regions. For instance, "Granite City" is a real place in the US, "Sandstone Point" might be a real place. Whereas Basalt Ridge might be less common? Not sure.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's look at the candidates and see what might fit better.

The candidates are:

1. Flint River
2. Marble Falls
3. Gneiss Lake
4. Gypsum Canyon
5. Travertine Springs
6. Pumice Point
7. Slate Creek
8. Obsidian Cliff

If I can figure out the pattern from the examples and anti-examples, then I can score the candidates.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let's see what the examples have in common that the anti-examples don't.

Examples: Limestone (sedimentary), Sandstone (sedimentary), Granite (igneous).

Anti-examples: Basalt (igneous), Chalk (sedimentary), Shale (sedimentary).

Hmm, so the rock types in both sets are a mix of sedimentary and igneous. So that's not the differentiator.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the second part of the names. The examples have Cove, Point, City. The anti-examples have Ridge, Mountain, Valley.

Looking at the second parts:

Examples: Cove (a small sheltered inlet), Point (a narrow piece of land jutting out), City (human settlement).

Anti-examples: Ridge (a narrow elevation), Mountain (a large landform), Valley (a low area between hills).

Maybe the specific theme is that the second part is a smaller or more specific geographical feature (like Cove, Point) or a human-made feature (City), whereas the anti-examples are larger natural features (Mountain, Valley, Ridge). But then "Granite City" is a city, which is human-made. So maybe the theme combines a rock type with either a small natural feature or a human-made place. Whereas the anti-examples combine with larger natural features.

If that's the case, then the candidates should be evaluated based on whether their second part is a small natural feature or human-made, versus larger natural.

Let's see:

Candidate 1: Flint River. Flint is a rock/mineral (a type of quartz). River is a natural feature. A river is a larger feature than a cove or point, but maybe it's a medium size. Hmm, not sure.

Candidate 2: Marble Falls. Marble is a metamorphic rock. Falls is a natural feature (waterfall), which is a specific point, so that might fit.

Candidate3: Gneiss Lake. Gneiss is a metamorphic rock. Lake is a body of water, which is a natural feature. Not sure if it's small enough.

Candidate4: Gypsum Canyon. Gypsum is a mineral, not a rock? Or gypsum rock. Canyon is a larger feature, like a valley. That might be an anti-example's style.

Candidate5: Travertine Springs. Travertine is a sedimentary rock. Springs is a small water feature, so maybe that's a good fit.

Candidate6: Pumice Point. Pumice is a volcanic rock (igneous). Point is a good fit (like Sandstone Point). So that's a strong candidate.

Candidate7: Slate Creek. Slate is a metamorphic rock. Creek is a small water feature, like a river but smaller. That might fit.

Candidate8: Obsidian Cliff. Obsidian is volcanic glass (igneous). Cliff is a large rock face, similar to Ridge or Mountain, which were in the anti-examples. So maybe that's an anti-example.

Wait, but the examples include "Granite City" which is a human-made feature, so maybe human-made features are allowed. So if a candidate has a human-made feature, like a city, that's okay. But in the candidates, none of them have a city except maybe none. Let's see:

Looking back, the examples have "City", which is human-made. So maybe the theme allows either small natural features (like cove, point) or human-made features (city). The anti-examples have Ridge, Mountain, Valley (all natural but larger). So the candidates should be evaluated based on whether their second part is a small natural feature or human-made, versus larger natural.

So:

1. Flint River: River is a medium/large natural feature. Not a small one. So maybe lower score.

2. Marble Falls: Falls is a specific point (like a waterfall), so that's a good fit. High score.

3. Gneiss Lake: Lake is a larger body of water. Maybe lower.

4. Gypsum Canyon: Canyon is large, so anti-example style. Lower.

5. Travertine Springs: Springs is a small feature. Good.

6. Pumice Point: Point matches Sandstone Point. High.

7. Slate Creek: Creek is smaller than river. Maybe mid to high.

8. Obsidian Cliff: Cliff is a large feature, like Ridge or Mountain. So anti-example style. Low.

Now, let's see the anti-examples: Basalt Ridge (ridge is a large feature), Chalk Mountain (mountain is large), Shale Valley (valley is large). So those are all large natural features. The examples have Cove (small), Point (small), City (human-made). So the specific theme is Rock + (small natural feature or human-made place).

Thus, candidates with Rock + small feature (like Point, Cove, Falls, Springs, Creek) or human-made (City) would be good. Those with Rock + large natural features (Valley, Ridge, Mountain, Canyon, River, Cliff) would be worse.

Now, scoring each candidate:

1. Flint River: River is a medium/large feature. Not small. So maybe 3 or 4.

2. Marble Falls: Falls is a small feature (like a waterfall point). 8 or 9.

3. Gneiss Lake: Lake is large, so 1 or 2.

4. Gypsum Canyon: Canyon is large. 1 or 2.

5. Travertine Springs: Springs is small. 8 or 9.

6. Pumice Point: Matches exactly with Sandstone Point. 10? Wait, but the examples include Granite City, which is human-made. So maybe Pumice Point is a 10? Wait but the user said to not use 10s unless perfect. Wait the examples are all 10s, but the anti-examples are 0s. But the candidates might not be exact. Let me think. Since the user says to use the full range, maybe Pumice Point is a 9 or 10, but maybe there's a reason not to give 10. Maybe the theme requires the rock to be a certain type?

Wait, the examples include Limestone (sedimentary), Sandstone (sedimentary), Granite (igneous). The anti-examples have Basalt (igneous), Chalk (sedimentary), Shale (sedimentary). So the rock type isn't the differentiator. So the only differentiator is the second part's size or type. So Pumice Point is good (Point matches Sandstone Point), so maybe 9 or 10. But perhaps the user wants to avoid 10 unless it's exactly like an example. Since Pumice is a volcanic rock (igneous), similar to Granite and Basalt. But since the theme allows any rock type as long as the second part fits, then it should be okay. Let's say 10 is possible, but maybe the user wants to be cautious. Let's see other candidates.

7. Slate Creek: Creek is smaller than river, so better than river. Maybe 6-7.

8. Obsidian Cliff: Cliff is large, so 0-2.

Wait, but the examples include "Granite City" which is human-made, so maybe human-made is allowed. But the candidates don't have any with a city except maybe none here. So focusing on natural features.

Now, let's assign scores:

1. Flint River: River is a larger feature. Maybe 3. Since the examples have Cove (small), Point (small), City (human). River is bigger than those, so maybe lower.

2. Marble Falls: Falls is a specific point, so 8.

3. Gneiss Lake: Lake is large. 1.

4. Gypsum Canyon: Canyon is large. 1.

5. Travertine Springs: Springs is small, 9.

6. Pumice Point: Exact match with Sandstone Point. 10?

But the user said to use the full range and not just 0s and 10s. Since the examples are the given ones, maybe Pumice Point is a perfect match, so 10. But maybe there's a reason not to. Alternatively, maybe 9 because it's a different rock type? No, the rock type isn't the issue. So maybe 10 is okay.

7. Slate Creek: Creek is smaller than river, so maybe 6 or 7.

8. Obsidian Cliff: Cliff is large, so 0 or 1. Since anti-examples have similar (Ridge, Mountain), maybe 1.

Wait, let's see:

If the anti-examples have Ridge (similar to Cliff), then Obsidian Cliff would be like Basalt Ridge, so 0. But the user says anti-examples are 0, but candidates can have 0-10. So maybe Obsidian Cliff is a 0 or 1. Let's say 1.

But let me adjust again:

1. Flint River: Maybe 3.

2. Marble Falls: 8.

3. Gneiss Lake: 2.

4. Gypsum Canyon: 1.

5. Travertine Springs: 9.

6. Pumice Point: 10.

7. Slate Creek: 6.

8. Obsidian Cliff: 0.

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Maybe I should spread them more. Let's see:

Alternatively, maybe Pumice Point is 10, Travertine Springs 9, Marble Falls 8, Slate Creek 7, Flint River 4, Gneiss Lake 3, Gypsum Canyon 2, Obsidian Cliff 0.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the scores are spread out. Let me think again:

The best matches are Pumice Point (Point) and Travertine Springs (Springs), so 10 and 9.

Marble Falls (Falls) is similar to a point, so 8.

Slate Creek (Creek) is better than a river, so maybe 6 or 7.

Flint River (River) is worse than creek, maybe 4.

Gneiss Lake (Lake) is large, 3.

Gypsum Canyon (Canyon) is large, 2.

Obsidian Cliff (Cliff) is like the anti-examples, 1.

Wait, but then:

1. Flint River: 4

2. Marble Falls:8

3. Gneiss Lake:3

4. Gypsum Canyon:2

5. Travertine Springs:9

6. Pumice Point:10

7. Slate Creek:6

8. Obsidian Cliff:1

That uses 1-10 except for 5, but maybe that's okay. Alternatively, maybe Obsidian Cliff is 0.

Alternatively, maybe:

1. Flint River:3 (river is larger than creek but smaller than canyon)

2. Marble Falls:8

3. Gneiss Lake:2

4. Gypsum Canyon:1

5. Travertine Springs:9

6. Pumice Point:10

7. Slate Creek:6

8. Obsidian Cliff:0

This uses 0-10 except for 4,5,7 but maybe acceptable. Alternatively, adjust:

Flint River:4, Gneiss Lake:3, Gypsum Canyon:2, then Obsidian Cliff:1.

But I think the user wants the full range, so maybe Obsidian Cliff is 0, others as above.

Alternatively, maybe some of the candidates have other factors. For example, Flint is a mineral, not a rock? If the theme requires the first part to be a rock type, then Flint (a mineral) might be a problem. Let me check:

Limestone, Sandstone, Granite are all rocks. The anti-examples: Basalt (rock), Chalk (rock, sedimentary), Shale (rock). So the first part must be a rock type. Flint is a mineral (a type of quartz), not a rock. So Flint River would be a bad match because Flint is a mineral, not a rock. That's a key point I missed earlier!

Ah! This is important. The examples all have rock types (Limestone, Sandstone, Granite) as the first part. The anti-examples also have rock types (Basalt, Chalk, Shale). Therefore, the first part must be a rock type. So candidates where the first part is a mineral (not a rock) would be worse.

So Flint is a mineral (quartz variety), so Flint River would be a bad match because it's not a rock. Similarly, Pumice is a rock (volcanic rock), so that's okay. Obsidian is a rock (volcanic glass, considered a rock). Marble is a metamorphic rock. Gypsum can be a rock (gypsum rock) or a mineral. Hmm, need to verify:

- Gypsum: Gypsum is a mineral, but sometimes used as a rock name (gypsum rock). Maybe acceptable.

- Travertine: A type of limestone, so a rock.

- Slate: A metamorphic rock.

- Slate Creek: slate is a rock.

- Gneiss: metamorphic rock.

- Marble: metamorphic rock.

- Pumice: volcanic rock (igneous).

- Obsidian: volcanic glass, considered a rock.

- Flint: mineral, not a rock. So Flint River would be a bad match because it's a mineral.

- Travertine is a rock.

So, correcting for that:

Candidate 1: Flint River: Flint is a mineral, not a rock → bad (0 or 1).

Candidate 4: Gypsum Canyon: Gypsum is a mineral, but sometimes considered a rock. If the theme requires the first part to be a rock, then maybe it's a 1 or 2.

Wait, need to confirm if Gypsum is considered a rock. Gypsum rock exists, so maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, if the examples all use rocks, then Gypsum might be borderline.

Similarly, Marble is a rock (metamorphic), so Marble Falls is okay.

So now the analysis changes significantly.

Let me redo the analysis considering that the first part must be a rock type (not a mineral).

Examples:

- Limestone (rock)

- Sandstone (rock)

- Granite (rock)

Anti-examples:

- Basalt (rock)

- Chalk (rock, sedimentary)

- Shale (rock)

So the first part must be a rock type. So any candidate where the first part is a mineral (not a rock) would score lower.

Now, re-analyzing candidates:

1. Flint River: Flint is a mineral → bad (0-2).

2. Marble Falls: Marble is a rock → good.

3. Gneiss Lake: Gneiss is a rock (metamorphic) → good.

4. Gypsum Canyon: Gypsum is a mineral (though sometimes used as rock). If considered a rock, maybe acceptable. Let's say borderline (maybe 3-5).

5. Travertine Springs: Travertine is a rock (a type of limestone) → good.

6. Pumice Point: Pumice is a rock → good.

7. Slate Creek: Slate is a rock (metamorphic) → good.

8. Obsidian Cliff: Obsidian is a rock → good, but the second part is Cliff (large feature → bad). So the first part is okay, but the second part is bad. So overall low score.

Now, combining both factors: first part must be a rock, and second part must be small/natural or human-made.

Let's re-score:

1. Flint River: First part is mineral → 0-2. Even if the second part (River) is medium, but the first part is wrong.

2. Marble Falls: Both parts good (rock + small feature). 9-10.

3. Gneiss Lake: Rock + Lake (large feature). So second part is bad. So maybe 3-5.

4. Gypsum Canyon: If Gypsum is a rock → rock + Canyon (large feature). So second part bad. Maybe 2-4.

5. Travertine Springs: Rock + Springs (small) → 9.

6. Pumice Point: Rock + Point (matches example) → 10.

7. Slate Creek: Rock + Creek (smaller than river → better than river). So maybe 7-8.

8. Obsidian Cliff: Rock + Cliff (large → anti-example style). So 1-2.

Now, let's assign scores considering both factors:

1. Flint River: 0 (mineral)

2. Marble Falls: 9 (rock + falls)

3. Gneiss Lake: 3 (rock + lake)

4. Gypsum Canyon: 2 (assuming gypsum is borderline rock)

5. Travertine Springs: 9 (rock + springs)

6. Pumice Point: 10 (rock + point)

7. Slate Creek: 7 (rock + creek)

8. Obsidian Cliff: 1 (rock + cliff)

Wait, but maybe Gypsum is considered a rock. Let me confirm: Gypsum is a mineral, but sometimes used in rock names like "gypsum rock" or "selenite" (a form). However, in place names, "Gypsum Canyon" might refer to a canyon rich in gypsum, which is a mineral. So maybe it's a mineral, so Gypsum Canyon would be bad for first part → score lower. Let's say 1.

Alternatively, if Gypsum is acceptable as a rock, maybe 3.

But I think it's safer to treat Gypsum as a mineral here, so 1.

Then:

1. Flint River: 0

2. Marble Falls:9

3. Gneiss Lake:3

4. Gypsum Canyon:1

5. Travertine Springs:9

6. Pumice Point:10

7. Slate Creek:7

8. Obsidian Cliff:1

But the user wants the full range. Maybe adjust:

Flint River:0

Marble Falls:9

Gneiss Lake:3

Gypsum Canyon:2

Travertine Springs:9

Pumice Point:10

Slate Creek:7

Obsidian Cliff:1

This uses 0,1,2,3,7,9,10. Missing some numbers. Maybe adjust some:

Gneiss Lake:4 (rock + lake)

Slate Creek:6

Then:

1. 0

2.9

3.4

4.2

5.9

6.10

7.6

8.1

That uses 0,1,2,4,6,9,10. Still missing some. Maybe:

Gypsum Canyon:1

Gneiss Lake:3

Slate Creek:7

So scores would be:

1.0

2.9

3.3

4.1

5.9

6.10

7.7

8.1

This uses 0,1,3,7,9,10. Still missing some. Maybe adjust:

Flint River:1 (maybe it's a rock in some contexts?)

But no, Flint is a mineral. So 0.

Alternatively, maybe Gypsum is a rock:

Gypsum as a rock → Gypsum Canyon: rock + canyon (large), so 2.

Gneiss Lake:3

Slate Creek:7

Travertine Springs:9

Pumice Point:10

Marble Falls:9

So scores:

1.0

2.9

3.3

4.2

5.9

6.10

7.7

8.1

Hmm. I think this is as close as I can get. The key is that Flint is a mineral (0), Gypsum is maybe a 1 or 2, and the rest follow.
