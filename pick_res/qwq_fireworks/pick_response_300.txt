Okay, let's see. The user provided examples and anti-examples to figure out the specific theme. The examples are a Native American bow with rawhide strips, a Polynesian paddle with plant fibers, and a medieval flail with leather thongs. The anti-examples are all metal tools with welded parts or screws. 

So the theme here probably revolves around traditional or ancient methods of joining parts using natural materials like rawhide, plant fibers, or leather. The key seems to be the use of non-metallic, organic bindings rather than welded metal or modern fasteners like screws or bolts. 

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Plastic toy sword with glued handle. Glue is a modern adhesive, not natural fibers. So probably low, maybe a 2 or 3? Since it's not using organic materials but a synthetic glue. But wait, the original examples used bindings (strips, fibers, thongs), not adhesives. So maybe even lower? Hmm, maybe a 1 or 2. But glue is a different method, not the same as lashing with fibers. So maybe 1?

2. Garden hoe with bolt. The anti-examples include a hoe with a bolt, so this is an anti-example. So that's a 0? Wait, the anti-examples given include a metal rake with welded tines and a hammer with welded handle. The garden hoe here uses a bolt, which is a modern fastener. So definitely not matching the theme, so 0 or 1. Maybe 1?

Wait the anti-examples include a carpenter's saw with screws. So bolts and screws are out. So garden hoe with bolt would be an anti-example, so 0.

3. Bamboo fishing rod with ferrules. Ferrules are usually metal tubes, so that's a modern connection. So that's similar to the anti-examples. So 0?

4. Kitchen knife with rivets. Rivets are metal, so again, like the anti-examples. So 0.

5. Ancient Egyptian spear with stone tip lashed using animal sinew. Animal sinew is a natural material, like the examples. So this is a strong match. Probably a 10? Or maybe 9 because sinew is different from rawhide or plant fibers, but still similar in being natural and lashed. The examples use different natural materials but same method. So 10?

6. Steel axe with metal wedge. A metal wedge is a traditional method but made of metal. The examples used non-metallic bindings. So this is a gray area. Some axes use wedges, which are metal, so maybe not matching. The anti-examples have welded parts but this is a wedge. Hmm. Maybe a 3? Because it's a traditional method but uses metal, so not exactly the same as the examples. The original theme requires non-metallic bindings. So maybe 2?

7. Modern composite bow with epoxy. Epoxy is a synthetic resin, not natural. The examples used rawhide strips. So even though it's a bow, the material is different. So maybe a 4? Because it's a bow but uses modern adhesives instead of natural bindings. So lower score.

8. Metal chisel with ferrule. Ferrule is metal, so again like the anti-examples. 0.

Wait let me reassess each candidate again carefully.

The theme is: items where parts are connected using natural, non-metallic materials (rawhide, plant fibers, leather thongs). The connection method is lashing or binding with organic materials. The anti-examples use welded metal, bolts, screws, etc.

1. Plastic toy sword with glued handle. Glue is synthetic, not natural binding. So 0 or 1? Maybe 1 because it's not using any metal fasteners but a modern adhesive. But the examples use physical bindings, not adhesives. So maybe 0.5, but since we need integers, 1?

2. Garden hoe with bolt. Definitely an anti-example. 0.

3. Bamboo fishing rod with ferrules. Ferrules are metal, so 0.

4. Kitchen knife with rivets. Rivets are metal, so 0.

5. Ancient Egyptian spear with sinew lashing. Perfect match. 10.

6. Steel axe with metal wedge. The wedge is metal, so even if traditional, it's metal. So not matching. Maybe 2? Because it's a traditional tool but uses metal instead of natural bindings. So lower than examples.

7. Modern composite bow with epoxy. Epoxy is synthetic, so not natural. But the bow is the same type as the first example. So maybe 3? Since it's the same category (bow) but uses modern adhesive instead of rawhide. So a bit closer than others but still not matching.

8. Metal chisel with ferrule. 0.

Wait, candidate 3: bamboo fishing rod with ferrules. Ferrules are usually metal tubes that hold sections together. Since they are metal, that's similar to the anti-examples. So 0.

Candidate 7: composite bow uses epoxy. The original example used rawhide. So epoxy is a synthetic, so not matching the natural material. So maybe 2? Because it's the same item type but different material. But maybe 3? Since it's still a bow but the connection method is different.

Candidate 6: axe with metal wedge. The traditional method for axes can sometimes use a wedge, which is metal. Since the examples use non-metallic bindings, this would be a 0? Or maybe 1? Because it's using a different method but still a traditional tool. Hmm, but the wedge is a metal part. So maybe 1?

Wait, let's see the examples again. The medieval flail uses leather thongs (non-metal), so even if the axe's wedge is traditional, since it's metal, it's not matching the theme. So maybe 1?

Candidate 1: plastic toy with glue. Since it's plastic and glue, not natural materials, so 0 or 1. Maybe 1 because it's a handle attached but with glue instead of lashing.

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust:

5 is 10.

The others:

1: 1

2:0

3:0

4:0

6:1

7:2

8:0

Wait, but maybe the composite bow (7) is a better match than the axe? Because it's the same type of item (bow) but with a different attachment method. So maybe 3?

Alternatively, since the epoxy is a modern adhesive, which is not the same as rawhide strips, so lower than examples but maybe higher than others.

Let me think of the scale. The examples are 10. The anti-examples are 0.

Candidates that are similar but use a slightly different method but still traditional? Maybe like if they used a different natural material? But in the given candidates, only 5 fits that.

Others that are close but not exact:

The axe with a wedge (6) uses a metal part, so 1.

The composite bow (7) is a bow but with epoxy, so maybe 2.

The plastic toy (1) is glued, so 1.

The rest are 0.

So scores would be:

1:1

2:0

3:0

4:0

5:10

6:1

7:2

8:0

Wait, but candidate 3 is a bamboo fishing rod with ferrules. Ferrules are metal, so definitely 0.

Candidate 7's score as 2 makes sense because it's the same category (bow) but with a modern adhesive instead of natural bindings. So maybe 3?

Alternatively, maybe 4? Not sure. Since epoxy is a synthetic resin, not organic, but it's still a bonding method. The examples use lashing with strips, so maybe the composite bow's method is different enough to be lower. Maybe 2 or 3.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me see the possible scores again. The user wants them to be granular from 0 to 10. So let's see:

For candidate 5, 10.

For the others, the next best would be the ones that are similar but use different materials. The axe (6) is 1, composite bow (7) maybe 2, plastic (1) 1. The rest 0.

Alternatively, maybe the composite bow is a 3 because it's the same item type but with a modern method. So maybe:

1:1

2:0

3:0

4:0

5:10

6:1

7:3

8:0

That seems okay.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 7 is a 4? Not sure. But given that it's the same item category (bow) but with a different method, maybe higher than the axe.

Alternatively, the axe's wedge is a traditional method but uses metal, so it's closer to the anti-examples. Whereas the composite bow uses a modern method but same item. Hmm.

Alternatively, the composite bow's method (epoxy) is more different than the wedge. So maybe the axe is a 1, composite bow 2.

I think I'll go with:

1. Plastic toy: 1

2. Hoe with bolt: 0

3. Bamboo with ferrules:0

4. Knife with rivets:0

5. Spear with sinew:10

6. Axe with wedge:1

7. Composite bow with epoxy:2

8. Chisel with ferrule:0

So the scores would be as above.
