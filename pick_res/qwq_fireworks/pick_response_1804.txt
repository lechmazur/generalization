Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples Cook Island, Marco Polo Island, and Vasco da Gama Island share. Then, I have to determine why the anti-examples (Palm Jumeirah, World Islands, Durrat Al Bahrain) don't fit that exact theme but might be part of a broader or related one. Finally, I need to evaluate each candidate on how well they match the specific theme, not the broader ones.

Starting with the examples:
- Cook Island: James Cook was a British explorer, so this is named after an explorer.
- Marco Polo Island: Marco Polo was an Italian merchant and explorer.
- Vasco da Gama Island: Vasco da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who sailed to India.

So the specific theme seems to be islands named after famous explorers. The anti-examples are Palm Jumeirah, World Islands, Durrat Al Bahrain. These are artificial islands in the Middle East, part of large land reclamation projects. They aren't named after people but rather have descriptive or project-related names. Hence, they don't fit the explorer theme but might be part of a theme of artificial islands or real estate projects.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. **Amwaj Islands**: This is a residential area in Bahrain. The name "Amwaj" means "waves" in Arabic. It's likely part of a development project, similar to the anti-examples. Not an explorer's name. Score: Probably low, maybe 1-3.

2. **Venetian Islands**: These are a group of islands in Miami, named after Venice. The Venetian might refer to the city's Italian heritage, not an individual explorer. However, Venice is linked to Marco Polo (who was from Venice), but the name isn't directly his. Maybe a bit of a stretch. Maybe a 4-6?

3. **Rokko Island**: Rokko is a mountain in Japan, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe it's part of a place name. If it's just a geographical name, not an explorer, then low. Alternatively, if it's named after someone, but I can't recall an explorer named Rokko. Maybe 1-3.

4. **Deira Islands**: Another development in Dubai. Deira is a district in Dubai, so this is likely a real estate project name, similar to the anti-examples. Low score, maybe 0-2.

5. **Ocean Cay**: Ocean Cay is a private island owned by Carnival Cruise Line. "Cay" is a small island, but "Ocean Cay" doesn't reference an explorer. It's a brand name. So low, maybe 0-2.

6. **Port Island**: This could refer to several places. For example, Port Island in Osaka, Japan, is a man-made island. The name "Port" is functional, not after an explorer. So low, maybe 1-3.

7. **Magellan Island**: Ferdinand Magellan was a Portuguese explorer who led the first circumnavigation. If this island is named after him, that fits the explorer theme. However, there's an island named Isla Magdalena (sometimes called Magellan's Island) in Chile associated with him. So this seems like a strong candidate. Maybe 8-10.

8. **Discovery Island**: This could be tricky. "Discovery" might refer to a ship or an expedition. For example, Captain Cook's ships had the name Resolution and Discovery. There's a Discovery Island in the Bahamas (owned by Disney), but it's named after the ship, not directly the explorer. However, the ship was named after the concept of discovery, which ties to exploration. But does it directly name an explorer? Maybe a mid-range score like 5-7.

Wait, let me recheck each:

- Venetian Islands: The Venetian might reference Venice, which is linked to Marco Polo, but the name itself isn't the explorer's name. So maybe 3-5.

- Magellan Island: Definitely after an explorer, so 10?

- Discovery Island: If it's named after the ship of Cook, then indirectly linked to an explorer but not the explorer's name. So maybe 6-7?

- Rokko Island: If it's just a geographical name, then 0-2.

- Amwaj: 0-2.

- Deira: 0-2.

- Ocean Cay: 0-2.

- Port Island: 1-3.

Wait, but the anti-examples are all artificial developments, so any candidate that's an artificial project without an explorer's name should be low. Magellan and Discovery might be the only ones close. Let's refine:

1. Amwaj Islands: 1 (since it's a development, not an explorer)
2. Venetian Islands: 3 (indirectly linked to Venice/Marco Polo, but not the explorer's name)
3. Rokko Island: 1 (no explorer)
4. Deira Islands: 0 (development)
5. Ocean Cay: 0 (brand name)
6. Port Island: 2 (functional name)
7. Magellan Island: 10 (directly named after an explorer)
8. Discovery Island: 6 (named after a ship, which is linked to exploration, but not directly an explorer's name)

Wait, but Discovery Island might be named after the ship of Cook's, so the ship's name "Discovery" is tied to exploration, but not the explorer's name. So maybe 5? Hmm. Alternatively, if there's an island named after a specific explorer's discovery, but not the explorer's name. Maybe 5.

Alternatively, if "Discovery" is just a generic term, then lower. Let me think again. The examples are all directly named after the explorer's full name (Cook, Marco Polo, Vasco da Gama). So the key is the island is named after the explorer's name. So Magellan fits exactly. Discovery Island is not named after a specific explorer, so it's not a direct match. So maybe 4?

Alternatively, if there's an island named after the concept of discovery (like the Discovery Channel?), but that's not an explorer's name. So maybe 3.

Hmm, tricky. Let's try to assign scores with more precision:

1. Amwaj Islands: 1 (development, not explorer)
2. Venetian Islands: 2 (Venice is linked to Marco Polo, but not his name)
3. Rokko Island: 1 (no explorer)
4. Deira Islands: 0 (development)
5. Ocean Cay: 0 (brand name)
6. Port Island: 1 (functional)
7. Magellan Island: 10 (direct explorer name)
8. Discovery Island: 4 (named after a ship, which is part of exploration history, but not the explorer's name)

Alternatively, maybe Discovery Island is a place named after the ship Discovery, which was commanded by Cook. So the ship's name is linked to an explorer (Cook), but the island's name is after the ship, not the person. So it's one step removed. That might be a 5 or 6?

Wait, the original examples are directly named after the explorers. So any name that isn't directly the explorer's name would be a lower score. So Discovery would be lower than Magellan. Maybe 5? Let's see:

Magellan is 10.

Discovery: 5.

Venetian: 2.

Others as before.

But need to ensure the scores are spread out. Let me list again:

1. Amwaj: 1

2. Venetian: 3 (maybe a bit more, since Venice is linked to an explorer, even if not named after him directly. But not enough for higher than 3?)

3. Rokko: 1

4. Deira: 0

5. Ocean Cay: 0

6. Port: 2

7. Magellan: 10

8. Discovery: 5

Alternatively, maybe Discovery is 6? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Discovery is a 7? Because it's associated with exploration, even if not the explorer's name. But the theme is specifically "named after an explorer", so that would require the name to be the explorer's name. Therefore, Discovery is not, so it's lower.

Alternatively, perhaps "Discovery" is a stretch, but maybe in some contexts it's named after a specific explorer's expedition. For example, Discovery Island in the Bahamas was named by Disney, but it's not after an explorer. So probably a 4.

I think I need to make sure the scores are spread from 0 to 10. Let me try:

1. Amwaj: 1 (development)
2. Venetian: 2 (indirect Venice link)
3. Rokko: 1
4. Deira: 0
5. Ocean Cay: 0
6. Port: 2
7. Magellan: 10
8. Discovery: 4 (named after a ship, which is part of exploration history, but not the explorer's name)

Alternatively, Discovery could be 5. Let's see:

Alternatively, maybe "Discovery" is a common enough term that it's not tied to any specific explorer, so lower.

Alternatively, if there's an island named after the ship commanded by Cook, then it's a direct link to an expedition led by an explorer. But the name is still not the explorer's own name. So maybe 5?

Alternatively, the anti-examples are all artificial projects, so anything that's a real island named after an explorer would score higher. Wait, but the examples are all "Island" names. So Magellan is a real island named after an explorer. Discovery might be a real place too. For example, Discovery Island in the Gal√°pagos? Not sure. But the key is the naming after the explorer.

Thus, only Magellan is a 10. Discovery is a 5, others are lower. Let's proceed with that.
