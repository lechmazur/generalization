Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples share, and then determine why the anti-examples don't fit exactly but are still related. The examples given are Mayan pyramids for religious ceremonies, Buddhist stupas, and Indigenous totem poles. The anti-examples are Chinese pagodas, Greek temples, and Egyptian obelisks.

Hmm, the key here is to identify what exactly unites the examples and excludes the anti-examples. Let's break down each example:

1. **Mayan pyramids used for religious ceremonies**: These were definitely for religious purposes, often involving rituals, sacrifices, or astronomical events. They were central to Mayan religious practices.

2. **Stupas in Buddhist traditions**: Stupas are sacred monuments in Buddhism, housing relics or serving as places of meditation and veneration. They are integral to Buddhist religious practices and teachings.

3. **Totem poles in Indigenous cultures**: These are symbolic structures representing clan lineages, historical events, or cultural stories. They have spiritual significance and are part of the indigenous communities' religious or ceremonial practices.

Now the anti-examples:

- **Chinese pagodas**: These are multi-story towers, often Buddhist, but they also serve as watchtowers or scholarly spaces. While they might be associated with religion, they have broader functions beyond just religious ceremonies. Some might be more about housing scriptures or serving community purposes.

- **Greek temples**: These were indeed religious, but they were more about housing cult statues of gods and were part of ancient Greek religion. However, Greek temples might be considered more as architectural structures for worship rather than being directly tied to specific ceremonial acts like the Mayan pyramids or Indigenous totem poles. Also, their function might be more static, serving as shrines rather than active ceremonial sites.

- **Egyptian obelisks**: These were religious monuments, but they were often placed at temple entrances and symbolized the sun god. They might be more symbolic and not used as active ceremonial sites like the examples given. Their role is more commemorative or symbolic rather than a space for ceremonies.

So the specific theme here seems to be structures that are **directly and primarily used for religious ceremonies, rituals, or spiritual practices** within their respective cultures, and are central to the religious or spiritual activities of those cultures. The anti-examples, while religious, either have additional non-religious functions, serve as symbols without active rituals, or are part of a more general religious architecture without the specific ceremonial use.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Roman amphitheaters**: These were for public spectacles like gladiator fights, not religious ceremonies. So probably low score, maybe 0-2. But wait, sometimes religious events might have been held here? Not sure. But their primary use was for entertainment and public gatherings. So maybe 1 or 2.

2. **Torii gates in Shinto shrines**: These mark the entrance to sacred spaces in Shinto, so they are religious but not the actual site of ceremonies. The ceremonies happen at the shrine's main hall or other areas. The torii itself is a symbolic boundary, not where rituals take place. So maybe around 3-4.

3. **Native American sweat lodges**: These are used for purification rituals and spiritual ceremonies. They are directly tied to religious/ceremonial use. This seems like a strong candidate. Maybe 8-9.

4. **Stonehenge**: Its purpose is debated, but it's associated with religious/ceremonial activities, especially astronomical events. Since it's prehistoric, we can't be certain, but it's considered a ritual site. Maybe 7-8.

5. **Islamic minarets**: These are towers for calling Muslims to prayer. While religious, their primary function is to issue the call to prayer, not as a site for ceremonies. The main ceremonies (prayers) happen in the mosque. So maybe 2-3.

6. **Medieval cathedrals**: These are places of worship and hold religious services. However, they might be more general religious buildings. The anti-examples include Greek temples which are also places of worship. Wait, but the examples are more specific. The Mayan pyramids were for specific ceremonies. Cathedrals are for regular services, so maybe a bit broader. But they are central to religious practice. Hmm, maybe 5-6?

7. **Hindu temples**: These are definitely central to religious ceremonies, rituals, and devotion. They are used for daily worship, festivals, etc. This seems very close to the examples. Maybe 9-10.

8. **Aztec ball courts**: These were for ritual ballgames that had religious significance, sometimes linked to human sacrifice. So they were ceremonial. This is a strong candidate. Maybe 8-9.

Wait, let me reassess each candidate again with the theme in mind: structures used *directly for religious ceremonies/rituals*. 

1. Roman amphitheaters: Not religious, so 0 or 1. Maybe 1 since some events might have had religious elements, but not the primary use.

2. Torii gates: Not a site for ceremonies, just a boundary. 2.

3. Sweat lodges: Directly used for rituals. 9.

4. Stonehenge: Likely ceremonial, so 7.

5. Minarets: Not a place for rituals. 1.

6. Medieval cathedrals: Central to religious services (masses, etc.), so maybe 7. But the anti-examples include Greek temples which are similar. Since Greek temples are excluded, maybe cathedrals are a broader category? Wait, the examples include Mayan pyramids (ceremonial), stupas (ritual objects), and totem poles (spiritual symbols). Maybe cathedrals are more like Greek temples, which are excluded. So perhaps 5?

Hmm, need to clarify. The anti-examples are excluded because they follow a broader theme. The specific theme is structures that are *directly used for religious ceremonies*. Greek temples were for housing deities and had rituals, but maybe their primary function as temples is considered too general compared to the examples which are more specific (like a pyramid for a specific ceremony). Similarly, cathedrals are places of worship with regular ceremonies, so maybe they are too general. So maybe medieval cathedrals would be a 6? 

7. Hindu temples: Yes, definitely for rituals and ceremonies. So 9 or 10. Since Mayan pyramids are 10, maybe 9.

8. Aztec ball courts: Directly part of religious rituals. 9 or 8. Since the examples include ball courts? No, the examples were Mayan pyramids, stupas, totem poles. Aztec ball courts are similar in being a site for ritual activities. So maybe 8 or 9. Let's say 8.

Let me check each again:

1. Roman amphitheaters: 1 (since not religious primarily)
2. Torii gates: 2 (symbolic, not a site)
3. Sweat lodges: 9 (direct ritual use)
4. Stonehenge: 7 (ritual but uncertain)
5. Minarets: 1 (call to prayer, not ceremony site)
6. Cathedrals: 5 (general worship, not specific ceremonial like examples)
7. Hindu temples: 9 (ceremonies)
8. Aztec ball courts: 8 (ritual but part of a game with religious significance)

That seems reasonable. Let me check if I can assign more nuanced scores. Maybe Stonehenge is 6? Since it's prehistoric and less certain. Maybe 6. Aztec ball courts 8, Hindu temples 9. 

Wait, the anti-examples include Egyptian obelisks which are monuments but not sites. So if a structure is a site where ceremonies happen, like the Mayan pyramids (climbed for ceremonies?), then ball courts where games were part of rituals would qualify. 

Okay, I think I can proceed with the scores as above.
