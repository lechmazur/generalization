Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the three examples share. The examples given are the thermocline in a lake, the meniscus of water in a graduated cylinder, and the aurora borealis in the Earth's atmosphere. 

Hmm, let's break these down. The thermocline is a layer in a lake where the temperature changes rapidlyâ€”it's a transitional boundary between the warmer surface water and the colder deep water. The meniscus is the curve of a liquid's surface in a container, caused by surface tension and adhesion, marking the boundary between the liquid and air. The aurora borealis is a natural light display in the sky, resulting from charged particles colliding with Earth's atmosphere, occurring near the poles. 

What's common among these? They all represent transitional zones or interfaces between two different states or regions. The thermocline is a transition in temperature layers, the meniscus is the interface between liquid and gas, and the aurora is an atmospheric phenomenon at the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, influenced by solar winds. So the theme seems to be transitional interfaces or boundaries between different layers or states within a system.

Now, the anti-examples are a person in a doorway, a person at the beach where water meets sand, and a person on a tightrope. These are all about people at physical edges or transitions, but the key difference is that the original theme's examples are natural phenomena, not involving humans. The anti-examples involve humans at transitional points, which is a broader or related theme but not the specific one. The specific theme is natural transitional interfaces or boundaries without human involvement.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. A person on a seesaw: This is a human at a balance point, a transitional state between up and down. But since it involves a person, it's similar to the anti-examples. So probably a lower score, maybe 2 or 3.

2. A soap bubble floating in the air: A soap bubble is a thin film of liquid between two gas phases (inside and outside the bubble). That's a clear interface between two phases, like the meniscus. So this matches well. Maybe 8 or 9.

3. A person on a zip line: Again, a human at a transitional point (mid-air between two points), so similar to anti-examples. Lower score, like 2 or 3.

4. A person standing at a crossroads: Another human at an intersection, so definitely an anti-example theme. Score 1 or 0.

5. A person on a swing: Human in a transitional motion (up and down), again involving a person. Lower score, maybe 2 or 3.

6. A person in a revolving door: Human at a transition between inside and outside a building. Again, human-involved transition. Score similar to others, maybe 1 or 2.

7. A river delta: This is where a river splits into branches near its mouth, forming wetlands between land and water. It's a natural transitional zone between river and ocean/sea, similar to the thermocline or meniscus as a boundary. So high score, maybe 9 or 10.

8. A person in a hot air balloon: Human in a transitional space (air vs ground), but again, human-involved. Maybe 3 or 4.

Wait, let me check again. The river delta is definitely a natural boundary between river and sea, so that's a strong match. The soap bubble is an interface between two gases via a liquid film, so that's a direct match like the meniscus. The others with people are all human-involved transitions, which are the anti-examples' theme. 

So adjusting the scores:

1. Seesaw: 2 (human, transitional state)
2. Soap bubble: 9 (natural interface)
3. Zip line: 2 (human)
4. Crossroads: 0 (human, clear anti-example)
5. Swing: 2 (human)
6. Revolving door: 1 (human, very much like anti-examples)
7. River delta: 10 (perfect natural boundary)
8. Hot air balloon: 3 (human in air, transitional space but human involved)

Wait, but the thermocline is a vertical boundary in a lake, meniscus is a surface boundary, aurora is an atmospheric boundary. The river delta is a geographical boundary. So delta is a good fit. Soap bubble is a liquid-gas interface, same as meniscus. The others with humans are all anti-examples. 

So the scores would be:

1. 2

2. 9

3. 2

4. 0

5. 2

6. 1

7. 10

8. 3

But let me check again. The hot air balloon is in the atmosphere, so maybe the person is in the atmosphere's boundary? But the aurora is a natural phenomenon, so the person in the balloon is an observer, not the boundary itself. So it's still human-involved, so low. Maybe 3 is okay. 

The revolving door is a transition between inside and outside a building, which is a human-made boundary with a person. So 1 makes sense. 

Swing, seesaw, zip line are all human activities at balance points or transitions, so they're similar to the anti-examples. 

So I think that's the breakdown.
