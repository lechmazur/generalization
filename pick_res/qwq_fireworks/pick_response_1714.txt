Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the three given examples share, while the anti-examples do not. The examples are:

1. Woman at a Window by Mary Cassatt (1880)
2. Portrait of a Woman at a Window by Gustave Caillebotte (1880)
3. Young Woman at a Window by Berthe Morisot (1879)

Looking at these, the common elements seem to be:
- A single woman (or "Young Woman") as the subject.
- The setting involves a window.
- The artists are all Impressionist or associated with the movement (Cassatt, Caillebotte, Morisot were part of the Impressionists).
- The dates are around the late 1870s to early 1880s (1879-1880).

Now, the anti-examples are supposed to not fit the exact theme but a broader one. They are:
1. Single figure viewed from the front looking out a window, painted in 1875
2. Single figure viewed from the side looking out a window, painted in 1870
3. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a mirror, painted in 1885

These anti-examples share some elements but differ in specific aspects. The first two are off in the angle (front/side instead of maybe a different perspective) and the year (earlier than the examples). The third has the figure looking at a mirror instead of a window, which is a different object, and it's from 1885, slightly later but maybe still in the timeframe.

So, the specific theme must include:
- A single woman (gender specified? The examples all have "Woman" in the title, so maybe gender is part of it).
- At a window (the setting must involve a window, not another object like a mirror or garden).
- Painted by a specific group of artists (Impressionists?), but maybe the key is the time period (late 1870s-early 1880s).
- The perspective might not be specified in the examples, but the anti-examples vary the angle (front, side, behind). Wait, but the examples don't mention the viewing angle. Hmm, maybe the angle isn't part of the theme. Wait, the anti-examples include "viewed from behind" which is one of the candidates. But the examples don't specify the angle, so perhaps the angle isn't part of the theme. Wait, the anti-examples include different angles, but the original examples don't specify, so maybe the angle isn't part of the theme. Wait, but the anti-examples are supposed to not match the specific theme but could be part of a broader one. So perhaps the specific theme includes that the figure is a woman, at a window, by those specific artists (Cassatt, Caillebotte, Morisot) around 1879-1880. Alternatively, maybe the key is the combination of "Woman at a Window" in the title, along with the time period and the specific artists.

Wait, looking at the examples, all have "Woman at a Window" in their titles, except the Caillebotte one is "Portrait of a Woman at a Window". The Morisot is "Young Woman at a Window". So the title structure includes "Woman at a Window" with some variation, and the time period is 1879-1880. The artists are all part of the Impressionist circle. The anti-examples don't mention the artist, so maybe the artist isn't part of the theme. Alternatively, the key elements are the title structure (including "Woman" and "Window"), the time period (late 1870s/early 1880s), and perhaps being a single figure. The anti-examples might not have the exact title structure, or the time is slightly off (like 1885), or they involve a different object (mirror, garden, etc.) instead of a window.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1900
- Has a window, but the year is 1900 (later than the examples' 1879-1880). So time is off. The figure is single, but the angle is behind, which the anti-example 3 uses (but anti-examples are not part of the specific theme). Since the original examples don't specify the angle, maybe the angle isn't part of the theme. But the time is a problem. So score might be lower.

2. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a garden, painted in 1880
- The setting is a garden instead of a window. So the key element (window) is missing. Thus, this is an anti-example. So score low.

3. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a painting, painted in 1880
- Looking at a painting, not a window. So missing the window element. Low score.

4. Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1910
- Window, but year is 1910 (much later). So time is off. Lower score.

5. Figure at a Window by Edgar Degas (1876)
- The title includes "Figure at a Window", which is similar to the examples. The artist is Degas, who was an Impressionist. The year is 1876, which is a bit earlier than the examples (1879-1880), but close. However, the examples have "Woman" in the title, whereas this says "Figure" (could be a woman, but not specified). So maybe a bit less precise. But the time is close, and the setting is correct. So maybe a higher score.

6. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a door, painted in 1880
- The object is a door, not a window. So key element missing. Low score.

7. Painting of a group of people at a window from the 1880s
- Group instead of single figure. The examples are single women. So group disqualifies. Low score.

8. Single figure viewed from behind looking at a balcony, painted in 1880
- Balcony instead of window. So key element missing. Low score.

Now, considering the anti-examples, they include things like looking at a mirror (so not a window) or different angles, but the specific theme must exclude those. The key elements are:

- Single woman (or "Young Woman") at a window, painted around late 1870s/early 1880s, by Impressionist artists (maybe not strictly necessary, but the examples are all by those artists). The title structure includes "Woman" and "Window".

So candidate 5: Figure at a Window by Degas (1876). It's close in time (1876 vs 1879-1880), but the figure isn't specified as a woman. However, "Figure" could be a woman, but the examples specify "Woman", so this might be slightly less precise. But the title structure is similar, and the time is nearby. So maybe a 7 or 8?

Other candidates with window but wrong time: 1 (1900) and 4 (1910) get lower scores. Candidates without window (2,3,6,8) get very low. Candidate 7 is group, so low.

Candidate 5 is the best, maybe 8? Or maybe 7.

Wait, let's think again. The examples have the exact phrase "Woman at a Window" or similar. Candidate 5 is "Figure at a Window" by Degas (1876). Since the examples have "Woman", but this says "Figure", which is more general, it might not be as precise. However, Degas is part of the same group, and the time is close. The anti-examples might include non-woman figures, but the specific theme requires "woman". So maybe this is a 6?

Alternatively, if the theme is "single figure at a window from the late 1870s/early 1880s by Impressionists", then Degas fits, but since the examples all have "Woman", maybe the gender is important. So if the candidate doesn't specify the gender, it's less likely. So maybe a 5 or 6?

The other candidates with window but wrong time (1900, 1910) would be lower. Let's assign scores:

1. 1900, window, but time off. Maybe 3?

4. 1910, same as 1 but later. Maybe 2?

5. Degas 1876: 7? Or 6?

The rest (2,3,6,7,8) are without window or wrong object, so 0-2.

Candidate 7 is group, so 0.

Candidate 5 is the only one with window and correct time (close) but missing the gender. Maybe 6.

Wait, let's see:

The examples are all "Woman" in the title, so the specific theme might require "woman". So candidate 5's title doesn't specify gender. So that's a key difference. So it's less likely. So maybe 5 gets a 5.

Candidate 1: window but 1900. The examples are 1879-1880. 1900 is 20 years later. Maybe 2?

Candidate 4 is 1910, even later, so 1.

Candidates 2,3,6,8: no window, so 0 or 1.

Wait, candidate 2 is looking at a garden, so no window. 0.

Candidate 3: painting, no window. 0.

Candidate 6: door, 0.

Candidate 8: balcony, not window, 0.

Candidate 7: group, so 0.

So the scores would be:

1. 1900, window: 2

2. garden: 0

3. painting: 0

4. 1910, window: 1

5. Degas: 5 or 6?

6. door: 0

7. group: 0

8. balcony: 0

Wait, maybe candidate 5's time is 1876, which is a bit earlier than the examples (1879-1880). The examples are all within a 2-year span. 1876 is 3 years before. Maybe that's a bit too early. So maybe a 4?

Alternatively, if the time is flexible within the late 1870s, 1876 is acceptable. Maybe 5.

Alternatively, since it's by Degas, who is associated with the same group, maybe it's a better fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the key is the exact title structure "Woman at a Window", so "Figure" is less precise, so lower.

So perhaps 5 gets a 5.

Then the highest is 5 with 5, and others are lower.

Wait, but the user said to use the full range from 0-10. So maybe the best candidate (5) should be higher.

Alternatively, if the specific theme is "Woman at a Window" by Cassatt, Caillebotte, or Morisot in 1879-1880, then any other artist outside that group would not qualify. But the problem says the theme is not necessarily about the artist, since the anti-examples don't mention the artist. The examples have the same theme regardless of artist, so perhaps the artist isn't part of the theme. The key is the title structure (woman at a window) and time period.

So candidate 5 is "Figure at a Window" by Degas (1876). The title is slightly different, but the time is close. Maybe 6?

Alternatively, if the title must include "Woman", then it's a 3?

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best is to assign candidate 5 a 6 or 7.

Alternatively, considering the anti-examples include "single figure viewed from behind looking at a mirror, 1885" which is close in time but wrong object. The specific theme requires the window. So candidate 5 has window but not woman in the title. So maybe a 5.

The other candidates with window but wrong time (1 and 4) are 2 and 1 respectively.

The rest are 0.

So:

1. <score>2</score>

2. <score>0</score>

3. <score>0</score>

4. <score>1</score>

5. <score>5</score>

6. <score>0</score>

7. <score>0</score>

8. <score>0</score>

Alternatively, maybe candidate 5 is a 6 or 7. Let me think again. Since the examples are all in 1879-1880, 1876 is a bit earlier, but Degas is part of the same movement. The title "Figure" might still be acceptable if "Figure" can be a woman. The examples have "Young Woman" or "Woman", so maybe "Figure" is less specific but still within. Maybe 6?

Alternatively, maybe the title must explicitly state "Woman", so it's a 3?

Hmm. Since the user wants nuanced scores, I'll go with:

5. Figure at a Window by Edgar Degas (1876): 6

Because it has the window, close time, and is by a major Impressionist, even if the title isn't exact.

So final scores:

1. 2

2. 0

3. 0

4. 1

5. 6

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

Wait, candidate 8 is looking at a balcony, which is a structure near a window but not a window. So maybe a 1?

Wait, balcony is part of a window area sometimes, but not the window itself. So maybe 1?

Similarly, candidate 2 is looking at a garden, so no window. 0.

Candidate 8: balcony, not window, so 0 or 1?

If balcony is considered part of a window area, maybe a 1, but probably 0.

Alternatively, maybe balcony is a different feature. Let's stick with 0.

So the scores would be as above.
