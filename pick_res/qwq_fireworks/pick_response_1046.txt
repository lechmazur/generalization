Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples share. The examples given are a multi-layered cake, the Earth's atmosphere, and a semiconductor chip. Let me think about what these have in common.

A multi-layered cake has distinct layers, like different flavors or textures stacked on top of each other. The Earth's atmosphere has multiple layers such as the troposphere, stratosphere, etc., each with different characteristics. A semiconductor chip is made up of multiple layers of materials, like silicon layers and conductive pathways. So the common theme here seems to be something that is composed of distinct, organized layers or strata. 

Now, the anti-examples are a sedimentary rock, a canyon, and a glacier. Let's see why they don't fit the specific theme. Sedimentary rocks do have layers (strata), but maybe the theme is more about artificial or structured layers, whereas sedimentary rock layers form naturally over time. A canyon is a landform carved by erosion, not layered. A glacier is a mass of ice, which might have layers but they're part of its natural formation, perhaps not as structured or intentional as the examples. So the specific theme might be about having distinct, perhaps purposeful or structured layers, not just natural accumulation.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. **a volcano**: Volcanoes can have layers from different eruptions, but the volcano itself isn't a layered structure. The layers might be in the lava flows or ash deposits around it, but the volcano as a whole is a single structure. So maybe a low score, like 2 or 3.

2. **a tree trunk**: Tree trunks have growth rings, which are layers. But those are annual rings, showing growth over time. This is a natural layering, similar to sedimentary rock. Since the anti-example includes sedimentary rock, maybe this is too similar to the broader theme but not the specific one. Maybe a 4 or 5?

3. **a stalactite**: Stalactites form from mineral deposits over time, creating concentric layers. But again, this is natural and gradual, like sedimentary rock. So perhaps a 3.

4. **a coral reef**: Coral reefs are built up over time by corals, but they aren't layered in the same way. They have a structure but not distinct layers. Maybe a 2.

5. **an onion**: Onions have multiple layers, which are very distinct and organized. This seems closer to the examples. The layers are intentional in structure, like the cake's layers. Maybe a 7 or 8?

6. **a river delta**: Deltas have layers of sediment deposition, but again, this is natural and part of the landform's structure. Similar to a canyon or sedimentary rock. Maybe a 3 or 4.

7. **a geode**: Geodes have crystals formed in layers inside, but the exterior is a solid rock. The internal layers might count, but since the outside isn't layered, perhaps a 5 or 6.

8. **a mountain range**: Mountain ranges are large landforms with different rock layers, but the entire range isn't a layered structure. The layers are within the rocks, but like the anti-examples, this might be too broad. Maybe a 3.

Wait, let me double-check. The key is that the examples are multi-layered in a structured way. The volcano's layers are part of its deposits, but the volcano itself isn't a layered object. Tree trunk's rings are layers but natural. Onion is a good match because each layer is distinct and organized. River delta's layers are more about sediment but not as structured. Geode's crystals might form in layers, but the structure is different. Mountain range's layers are within the rocks, but the overall structure isn't layered like a cake or atmosphere. Hmm, maybe the mountain range is lower. Let me adjust the scores accordingly.
