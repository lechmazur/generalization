Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the specific theme from the given examples. The examples are:

1. A fish with iridescent scales for home aquariums.
2. A rose with glowing petals for ornamental gardens.
3. A butterfly with artwork-patterned wings for butterfly houses.

These all seem to be about organisms modified for aesthetic or decorative purposes in specific environments meant for display or beauty. The key elements here are:

- **Purpose**: Designed for display/ornamentation.
- **Application**: Specific venues (aquariums, gardens, butterfly houses).
- **Modification**: Aesthetic traits (colors, patterns, glow).

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. Plant for pharmaceuticals.
2. Bacterium for breaking down pollutants.
3. Microorganism for biodegradable plastics.

These are about practical, utilitarian uses (medicine, environmental cleanup, industrial materials). The anti-examples are not about aesthetics but functional benefits. The task is to score candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme (aesthetic display) and not the broader or related themes (like general utility or environmental benefits).

Now, let's go through each candidate:

1. **Soybean for biofuel** – Biofuel is a utilitarian purpose (energy production). This is more like the anti-examples (practical use), so probably a low score. But wait, is there any decorative aspect? No. So maybe 0-2.

2. **Yeast for efficient fermentation in brewing** – Brewing improvement is a functional enhancement. Again, practical use, so similar to anti-examples. Score low, maybe 1-3.

3. **Tree with temp-based leaf color for landscaping** – Landscaping is about aesthetics. The leaves changing color based on temperature could be a decorative feature. This fits the theme (ornamental use in landscaping). Maybe a higher score like 7-8.

4. **Grass resistant to foot traffic for sports fields** – Sports fields need durability, which is functional. Not for display, but utility. So low, maybe 1-3.

5. **Crop with salt tolerance for coastal farming** – This is an agricultural improvement for specific environments. Functional, not ornamental. Low score, 0-2.

6. **Fish modified to survive colder water for aquaculture** – Aquaculture is about farming fish for food or stock. Survival in colder water is practical, not for display. So low, maybe 1-3.

7. **Fruit tree with modified ripening for shipping** – Easier shipping is about logistics, practical. Not aesthetic. Score low, maybe 0-2.

8. **Salmon for faster growth** – Faster growth is for aquaculture efficiency, practical. Not ornamental. Low score, 0-2.

Wait, but let me double-check. For candidate 3: the tree's leaves change color based on temperature. The purpose is for landscaping, which is about making the environment look nice. The changing colors could be a decorative feature, similar to how the rose's glowing petals are for gardens. So that's a good match. So maybe 7 or 8.

Candidate 3: 7 or 8? The original examples had specific aesthetic traits (iridescent, glow, artwork patterns). The tree's color change is a dynamic aesthetic feature, which is a bit different but still for landscaping. Maybe 7.

Other candidates: Let me see again.

1. Soybean for biofuel – definitely utility, 0 or 1.

2. Yeast for brewing – functional, 2?

4. Grass for sports – functional, 1.

6. Fish for aquaculture survival – functional, 1.

5. Salt-tolerant crop – functional, 0.

7. Fruit tree ripening – functional, 0.

8. Faster growth salmon – functional, 0 or 1.

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust some scores. Let's see the scale from 0-10. The examples are 10, anti-examples 0. The candidates need to be graded in between.

The key is whether they are for display/ornamental purposes with aesthetic modifications. 

Candidate 3 is the closest. Maybe 8?

Others: Are there any that are partially related but not exactly?

Candidate 7: modified ripening for shipping. Not ornamental. 0.

Candidate 4: grass for sports fields. Maybe someone might think it's for aesthetics, but sports fields are functional. So 1.

Candidate 2: yeast for fermentation. Maybe 2 because it's a modification, but not for display.

Candidate 6: fish for colder survival. Maybe 1.

So assigning scores:

1. 0 (biofuel – utility)
2. 2 (yeast – functional improvement, not display)
3. 8 (landscaping with color change – aesthetic)
4. 1 (sports field grass – functional)
5. 0 (salt tolerance – agricultural)
6. 1 (aquaculture survival – practical)
7. 0 (shipping – logistics)
8. 0 (faster growth – efficiency)

Wait, but maybe some have a bit more? For example, candidate 3's temperature-based color change might be a bit more complex. The original examples had specific traits designed for display. The tree's color changes could be seen as a decorative feature, so maybe 8 is okay.

Alternatively, maybe 7. Let me think again. The original examples are all about the organism itself being modified for display. The tree's color change is a direct aesthetic feature for landscaping, so 8. 

Candidates 2 and 6: yeast and fish. They are modified for function but not for display. Maybe 2 and 1, respectively. 

Candidate 4's grass: maybe 1. 

So final scores:

1. 0

2. 2

3. 8

4. 1

5. 0

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

But wait, the user said to use the full range. Maybe some can be in the middle. Let me see if there's any candidate that's partially matching.

Candidate 7: fruit tree with modified ripening for shipping. Maybe easier shipping could mean the fruit looks better when shipped? Not really, it's about logistics. 0.

Candidate 8: faster growth salmon is purely for production efficiency. 0.

Candidate 2: yeast for fermentation. Maybe 2 is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe candidate 3 is a 7 instead of 8. Let me check the examples again. The examples have specific aesthetic traits (iridescent, glow, artwork). The tree's color change is a response to temperature, which could create a dynamic display, maybe even more engaging. So 8 is okay. 

Yes, I think that's the way to go. So the scores would be as above.
