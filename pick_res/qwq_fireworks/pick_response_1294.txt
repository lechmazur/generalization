Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples provided are:

1. Wax tablets in ancient Rome for writing and education.
2. Inca quipu's knotted strings for record keeping.
3. Ojibwe birch bark scrolls for songs and stories.

So, looking at these, they all are physical, ancient or traditional methods of recording information or cultural knowledge. Theyâ€™re all pre-modern, non-digital, and serve a purpose like record-keeping, education, or preserving cultural elements. 

Now the anti-examples are things like social media platforms, digital music platforms, and modern libraries with digital archives. These are all modern, digital, and part of contemporary technology. The key difference here is that the theme is about ancient/ traditional physical mediums for recording, whereas the anti-examples are modern digital equivalents.

So the specific theme seems to be: **Ancient or traditional non-digital methods used for recording information, education, or cultural preservation**.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **A blog about contemporary cultural practices**  
   Blogs are digital, contemporary, and about modern practices. Not ancient/traditional. So this is an anti-example. Score: 0 or 1. Since it's digital and modern, maybe 0.

2. **A streaming service offering educational content**  
   Streaming is modern digital. Even if educational, it's not an ancient physical method. Anti-example. Score: 0.

3. **A video game that teaches about present-day culture**  
   Video games are modern, digital. Teaching present-day culture isn't about preserving ancient methods. Definitely an anti-example. Score: 0.

4. **A smartphone used for storing family photos**  
   Smartphone is a modern digital device. Storing photos is similar to record-keeping but not traditional. Anti-example. Score: 0 or 1. Maybe 1 because it's storage, but still digital.

5. **A website dedicated to modern folklore**  
   Website is digital, modern. Folklore might be traditional, but the medium is not. So anti-example. Score: 0.

6. **A modern digital encyclopedia**  
   Digital and modern, so anti-example. Even if encyclopedias have a long history, the digital version is excluded. Score: 0.

7. **The clay tablets of the ancient Sumerians used for cuneiform writing**  
   This is an ancient physical method for writing, similar to the examples. Matches the theme perfectly. Score: 10.

8. **A contemporary history textbook**  
   Textbook is a modern printed medium. While it's about history, the medium is not ancient. So it's a broader theme (record-keeping) but not the specific ancient/traditional one. So maybe a 4 or 5? Because it's a physical book but contemporary. Since the examples are all ancient, maybe 3? Wait, the anti-examples include modern libraries (which are physical but digital archives), but textbooks are physical and non-digital? Hmm. Wait, the anti-examples include a modern library with digital archives, so a physical textbook might be closer but still modern. Maybe a 2 or 3. Because it's physical but not ancient. 

Wait, let me recheck. The specific theme requires ancient/traditional, so anything not ancient would be lower. The Sumerian tablets are ancient, so 10. The textbook is contemporary, so even though it's a book, it's not ancient. So maybe 0? But maybe it's a physical object. Wait, the examples are all non-digital and ancient. The anti-examples are digital, but the textbooks are physical but modern. So maybe it's a 1 or 2? Because it's physical but not ancient. The theme is specifically about ancient methods. So 0? Wait, but maybe the theme isn't strictly "ancient" but "traditional non-digital methods". Wait, the examples are all from ancient cultures, but maybe the theme is "traditional non-digital record-keeping methods", so a contemporary textbook might not qualify because it's not traditional. Hmm. The Ojibwe scrolls are traditional but not necessarily ancient in the same way as Sumerians, but they are pre-modern. So contemporary textbooks are modern, so 0. 

Wait, but the anti-examples include a modern library with digital archives, but a physical textbook is a physical item. Maybe the key is that the examples are all from ancient/ traditional societies, while the anti-examples are modern. So the textbook is modern, so 0. But maybe there's nuance. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "pre-modern, non-digital methods used by specific cultures for recording information". The Sumerian tablets fit perfectly (10). The textbook is modern, so 0. The others are all digital or modern, so 0. Wait, but maybe the "contemporary history textbook" is a physical book, so maybe a 1? But I think the key is the time period. The examples are all ancient/pre-industrial, so anything not in that era is 0. So 7 gets 10, others 0 except maybe the smartphone? No, smartphone is digital. So the scores would be:

1:0, 2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:10,8:0. But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each candidate again.

Wait, candidate 8: a contemporary history textbook. It's a physical book, but it's about history. However, the medium is modern, so even if the content is historical, the method (printing press, modern book) isn't traditional. So 0. 

But maybe the theme isn't strictly "ancient" but "non-digital traditional methods". If "traditional" can include older methods up to, say, before digital age, but the examples are all ancient. The anti-examples are digital, but the textbook is physical. Hmm. Maybe the key is that the examples are all from non-literate or early literate societies using their own indigenous methods (wax, quipu, birch bark). The Sumerian clay tablets are similar, so 10. The textbook is a modern method, even if physical. So 0. 

Alternatively, maybe "traditional" could include non-digital methods even in modern times, but the examples are all from ancient cultures. The anti-examples are digital, so a physical book might be a 5? Wait, but the anti-examples include a modern library with digital archives, but a physical book isn't digital. Maybe the theme is "non-digital methods used by ancient/pre-modern cultures". So the textbook is a modern method (even if physical), so 0. 

I think that's the case. So all except 7 are 0 except maybe the smartphone? Wait, the smartphone is a digital device, so 0. 

Wait, but let me check each candidate again. Let me list them again:

1. Blog: digital, contemporary. 0.

2. Streaming service: digital. 0.

3. Video game: digital, modern. 0.

4. Smartphone: digital. 0.

5. Website: digital. 0.

6. Digital encyclopedia: digital. 0.

7. Sumerian clay tablets: ancient physical. 10.

8. Contemporary textbook: physical but modern. 0.

So all except 7 are 0. But the problem says to use the full range. Wait, the user said to use 0-10, but maybe some candidates are partial matches. Maybe I need to consider nuances. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "non-digital record-keeping methods used by pre-industrial societies for cultural or educational purposes". The examples are all that. The anti-examples are digital. So for the candidates:

Candidate 8: A contemporary history textbook. It's a physical book, so non-digital. But it's from the modern era, so not pre-industrial. So maybe a 1? Because it's non-digital but not traditional. But the theme requires the specific cultural/educational use by pre-industrial societies. So it's 0. 

Alternatively, maybe a physical textbook is closer to the theme than a digital one? But the anti-examples include a modern library with digital archives, so the physical part might not be enough. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the key difference is that the examples are all indigenous or culturally specific methods (wax tablets in Rome, Inca quipu, Ojibwe scrolls). The Sumerian tablets are similar. The textbook is a general modern method, so not specific to a culture's traditional method. So maybe candidate 8 is 0.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "non-digital writing systems used for record-keeping, education, or cultural preservation in ancient or traditional societies". So the Sumerian tablets are a perfect 10. The textbook is a modern writing system but not in an ancient/traditional society. So 0.

So all except 7 are 0. But the user said to use the full range, so maybe some are 1 or 2. Let me think again. Maybe the smartphone for storing family photos is a physical device but digital. So maybe 0. 

Wait, perhaps the theme is "physical, non-digital methods for storing cultural information by ancient or traditional cultures". The anti-examples are digital. So any physical non-digital method from non-ancient cultures would get a low score but not 0. For example, a contemporary textbook is physical, non-digital, but not ancient. So maybe a 2? Because it's physical and serves a similar function (education/record), but not from the right time period. Similarly, a smartphone is digital, so 0. A website is digital, 0. 

So perhaps:

Candidate 8: 2 because it's physical and educational, but modern.

Candidate 4 (smartphone storing family photos): it's a physical device but digital storage (photos are digital), so 0.

Candidate 5 (website dedicated to modern folklore): digital, 0.

Candidate 1 (blog): digital, 0.

Candidate 2 (streaming service): digital, 0.

Candidate3 (video game): digital, 0.

Candidate6 (digital encyclopedia): digital, 0.

So only candidate7 is 10, candidate8 is 2, others 0. But maybe some others get 1?

Alternatively, maybe the contemporary history textbook is a physical book, so maybe 1? Or the website is digital but about folklore, which is cultural, but the medium is wrong. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is more about the function (recording cultural info) rather than the time period. But the examples are all ancient. The anti-examples are digital, so the theme must include the non-digital and ancient aspect.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are all analog, non-digital, and from before the modern era, and used by specific cultures. The anti-examples are digital. So any non-digital method from the modern era (like a textbook) would be a broader theme (non-digital record-keeping) but not the specific one. So maybe a 1 for the textbook.

Similarly, a smartphone (physical device but digital storage) is 0. A website (digital) is 0. So:

7:10

8:1

Others: 0

But the user wants the full range. Let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the anti-examples again. The anti-examples are:

A social media platform (digital, modern, cultural stories)

Digital music platform (digital, preserving songs)

Modern library with digital archives (digital)

The theme is the exact opposite of these: non-digital, ancient/traditional.

So the candidates must be non-digital and from ancient/traditional cultures.

So the only candidate that fits is 7 (Sumerian tablets).

The others:

8 is a contemporary textbook, which is non-digital but modern. So maybe 1?

4: smartphone is digital, so 0.

The rest are digital, so 0.

So scores would be:

1:0

2:0

3:0

4:0

5:0

6:0

7:10

8:1

But maybe the textbook is a 2. Maybe I need to think of the scale as 0-10, so even a small match gets 1-2. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "non-digital record-keeping systems used by ancient or indigenous cultures". The Sumerian tablets fit (10). The Ojibwe are indigenous, so maybe the contemporary indigenous methods would also count. But the candidates don't have that. The textbook is a modern, non-indigenous method, so 0 or 1.

Hmm. I think the user wants the full range, so perhaps some candidates get 3 or 4. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the theme is "physical, non-digital mediums used for cultural or educational purposes by ancient or traditional societies". So:

Candidate 8 (contemporary textbook) is physical, non-digital, but not ancient/traditional society. So maybe 2.

Candidate 4 (smartphone storing photos): physical device but digital storage, so 0.

Candidate 5 (website): digital, 0.

Candidate 1 (blog): digital, 0.

Candidate 2 (streaming): digital, 0.

Candidate3 (video game): digital, 0.

Candidate6 (digital encyclopedia): digital, 0.

Candidate7:10.

Candidate8:2.

So the scores would be:

1:0

2:0

3:0

4:0

5:0

6:0

7:10

8:2

That uses 0,2,10. Maybe the user wants more spread. Alternatively, maybe the contemporary history textbook is a 3 because it's a physical book used for education, even if modern.

Alternatively, maybe the Sumerian tablets are a perfect 10, and the others are 0 except maybe the Ojibwe example, but the candidates don't have that. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "writing systems used for record-keeping in ancient cultures", so Sumerian tablets (10), and maybe the Ojibwe scrolls are part of that. But the candidates don't have Ojibwe. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "pre-modern physical record-keeping methods". The Sumerian tablets are pre-modern (ancient), so 10. A contemporary textbook is post-industrial, so maybe 1. 

Alternatively, maybe "non-digital, non-electronic methods for cultural information storage by societies before the 20th century". Then a contemporary textbook would be 20th/21st century, so 0. 

Hmm. I think I need to stick with the initial analysis. The only exact match is 7. The others are 0 except maybe the textbook gets 1 or 2. Let me go with that.
