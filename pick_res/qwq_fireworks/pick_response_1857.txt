Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are flowing water, dewdrops, and autumn leaves. Let me think about what they have in common.

Flowing water is something that moves and changes over time. Dewdrops are temporary, forming and evaporating. Autumn leaves also change and eventually fall. So maybe the theme is about transient or temporary things that are part of natural cycles?

Now the anti-examples are an hourglass, a ticking clock, and a burning candle. These are also related to time, but maybe they represent more linear or measured time, whereas the original examples are more about natural, cyclical, or ephemeral processes. The anti-examples might be about time measurement, so the specific theme isn't just about time but something more specific like ephemeral natural phenomena.

Looking at the candidates:

1. Blossoms: Blossoms bloom and then wilt, so they're temporary and natural. That fits the theme. Maybe a 7 or 8?

2. A dying ember: It's fading, temporary, but is it natural? An ember could be from a fire, which is natural, but maybe not as much as the examples. Maybe a 5 or 6?

3. A shooting star: Temporary and natural, but it's a celestial event. The examples are more earth-based. Maybe a 6?

4. Bubbles: They pop quickly, very temporary. That's similar to dewdrops. Maybe an 8?

5. Footprints in the sand: Temporary, left by nature or humans. The examples are natural, so this might fit. Maybe a 7?

6. A melting ice sculpture: Melting is temporary, but an ice sculpture is human-made. The examples are natural. Maybe a 5?

7. A setting sun: It's a daily cycle, part of nature. But the anti-examples include a setting sun? Wait, no, the anti-examples are hourglass, clock, candle. The setting sun is part of the natural cycle, so maybe a 9?

Wait, but the anti-examples are about time measurement. The setting sun could be seen as part of the day's cycle, so maybe it's a bit too close to the broader theme. Hmm, maybe a 7?

8. Smoke: It dissipates, temporary, natural. Maybe a 6?

Wait, let me reassess. The original examples are all natural and have a sense of impermanence. The anti-examples are about timekeeping. So the theme is transient, natural, impermanent things. 

Blossoms (1) fit well (7-8). Dying ember (2) is transient but maybe less natural? Or is fire natural? Maybe 6. Shooting star (3) is transient and natural (maybe 7). Bubbles (4) are very transient and natural (8). Footprints (5) are temporary but maybe more about human interaction (so 5). Melting ice (6) human-made (5). Setting sun (7) is cyclical but a daily occurrence, so maybe 6-7. Smoke (8) is temporary but maybe not as cyclical (6). 

Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust. Let me think again. 

Flowing water (continuous movement), dewdrops (short-lived), autumn leaves (seasonal change). All are natural and have a sense of impermanence, but also part of a cycle. The anti-examples are about time measurement (hourglass, clock) or a single event (burning candle). 

Candidates:

1. Blossoms: They bloom and fade, part of a cycle. High match (8).

2. Dying ember: Part of a fire's cycle, but perhaps less central to a natural cycle. 6.

3. Shooting star: A brief event in the sky. Maybe 7?

4. Bubbles: Very temporary, maybe 8?

5. Footprints: Temporary but not part of a natural cycle (they're left by humans). 4?

6. Melting ice sculpture: Human-made, so 3?

7. Setting sun: Part of the daily cycle, but maybe too regular. 7?

8. Smoke: Disperses, but maybe not as cyclical. 5?

Wait, maybe the key is impermanence and natural occurrence. Let me try:

1. Blossoms: 8 (natural and temporary).

2. Dying ember: 6 (temporary but maybe less central).

3. Shooting star: 7 (temporary, natural phenomenon).

4. Bubbles: 9 (very temporary and natural? But bubbles can be human-made too. Hmm, maybe 7).

Wait, bubbles in nature like from a stream might be natural. If the candidate is just "bubbles" without context, maybe 7.

5. Footprints: 5 (temporary but human-made).

6. Melting ice sculpture: 4 (human-made ice).

7. Setting sun: 6 (daily cycle, part of nature but maybe too regular).

8. Smoke: 5 (disperses, but maybe from a fire, so natural? 6?).

This is tricky. Maybe I should go with the initial thought but ensure scores are spread out. Let me try again:

1. Blossoms: 8 (fits well).

2. Dying ember: 5 (temporary but less about natural cycles).

3. Shooting star: 7 (natural but maybe not part of the same cycle as the examples).

4. Bubbles: 9 (very transient, natural if from a stream).

5. Footprints: 4 (human-made).

6. Melting ice sculpture: 3 (human-made ice).

7. Setting sun: 6 (part of day cycle but perhaps too predictable).

8. Smoke: 5 (disperses, natural but maybe not as central).

Hmm, that's better. But need to ensure no two are too close. Alternatively, maybe:

1. Blossoms: 7

2. Dying ember: 6

3. Shooting star: 6

4. Bubbles: 8

5. Footprints: 5

6. Melting ice sculpture: 4

7. Setting sun: 7

8. Smoke: 5

But I need to make sure the scores are unique where possible. Alternatively, maybe:

1. 8

2. 6

3. 7

4. 9

5. 4

6. 3

7. 6

8. 5

But then two 6s. Maybe adjust:

1. 8

2. 6

3. 7

4. 9

5. 4

6. 2

7. 7

8. 5

Still duplicates. Hmm. Alternatively, spread them out:

1. 8

2. 5

3. 7

4. 9

5. 3

6. 2

7. 6

8. 4

That's unique. Let me think again. The key is the theme is natural, transient, part of cycles. 

- Blossoms (1): Definitely fits, 8.

- Dying ember (2): Part of a fire cycle, 6.

- Shooting star (3): Temporary but not part of a recurring cycle on Earth, maybe 5?

- Bubbles (4): 9? If natural bubbles like in a stream.

- Footprints (5): 4.

- Melting ice (6): 3.

- Setting sun (7): 7.

- Smoke (8): 5.

Wait, but maybe the setting sun is part of the daily cycle, so maybe 7 is okay. 

Alternatively, setting sun is part of the natural cycle, so 7 is better than shooting star's 5. 

I think this is as close as I can get. Let me assign the scores accordingly.
