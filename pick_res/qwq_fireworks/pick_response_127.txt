Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples "Personal computer," "Wireless communication," and "Helicopter" share. Then, I have to determine why the anti-examples like "Quantum computing," "Artificial intelligence," and "Blockchain" don't fit that exact theme but might be related in a broader sense.

Starting with the examples. A personal computer is a digital electronic device used for processing information. Wireless communication involves transmitting data without wires, like Wi-Fi or cellular networks. A helicopter is a type of aircraft that uses rotors for lift and propulsion. What's common here? They all seem to be technologies that are physical in nature, involved in computing, communication, or transportation. But maybe there's a more specific angle. 

Looking at the anti-examples: Quantum computing is a more advanced computing paradigm, which is related to computers but not the standard personal computer. AI is a field related to computing but isn't a physical device. Blockchain is a digital ledger technology, which is a form of communication or data structure but not exactly wireless. So the anti-examples are either more abstract, newer, or more conceptual extensions of the examples.

Hmm, maybe the theme is "20th-century inventions that are physical technologies with widespread practical applications." Let's check:

- Personal computer: became mainstream in the late 20th century.
- Wireless communication: radio and early wireless tech started in the late 19th/early 20th, but widespread use in the 20th century.
- Helicopter: first practical models in the 1930s, widely used post-WWII.

Anti-examples:
- Quantum computing: still emerging, not yet mainstream.
- AI: concept since mid-20th century, but practical applications are recent.
- Blockchain: 21st-century tech (Bitcoin in 2009).

So the theme might be "mid-20th century technologies that are tangible and have established practical uses in daily life or industry."

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. Genetic engineering: Began in the 1970s. It's a biotechnology, not exactly a physical device like the examples. It's more of a scientific method. So maybe a 6? But maybe lower because it's not as "physical" in the same way.

2. Virtual reality: While VR headsets exist, the concept started in the late 20th century but became mainstream later. Maybe a 5? Or maybe 7 if considering the hardware aspect.

3. 3D printing: Emerged in the late 20th century, but became more widespread in the 2000s. It's a physical tech, so maybe 7?

4. Internet: Developed in the mid-20th century (ARPANET in 60s), so fits. It's a communication network, so maybe 9? But wireless communication is an example, so internet is a broader category but fits the theme.

5. Telephone: Invented in the late 19th century, but became widespread in the 20th. Definitely fits the theme. So 10?

6. Electric light bulb: Invented in the late 19th century, so maybe a bit early. But widespread use in the 20th. It's a physical invention, so 8?

7. Radio: Early 20th century, so fits. 10?

8. Airplane: Wright brothers in 1903, so early 20th. Definitely a physical transportation tech. 10?

Wait, but the examples included helicopter, which is an airplane variant. So airplane would fit perfectly. But let me check the anti-examples again. The anti-examples are things that are either more abstract or newer. So maybe the theme is more about mid-20th century tech. Let me re-examine:

Helicopter became practical in the 1930s, so mid-20th. Personal computer's mainstream adoption was 1980s. Wireless communication (like cellular) in the late 20th. So maybe the theme is mid-to-late 20th century tech with physical devices used in everyday life or industry. 

So:

1. Genetic engineering: 1970s, but more of a biological science. Maybe 5?

2. Virtual reality: Devices started in the 80s, but not as mainstream. Maybe 6?

3. 3D printing: 80s, but 3D printers became common in 2000s. Maybe 7?

4. Internet: 1960s, but maybe considered part of the theme. 8?

5. Telephone: 19th century invention, but mass adoption in 20th. Maybe 9?

6. Electric light bulb: 1870s, so maybe a bit too early. 7?

7. Radio: 1900s, so early 20th. Maybe 9?

8. Airplane: 1903, so early 20th. 9?

Wait, but the original examples include helicopter (mid-20th), PC (late 20th), and wireless (which could be radio or cellular). Maybe the theme is "20th century inventions that are physical technologies with widespread practical applications in their time." So telephone and airplane are from the early 20th, but still within the century. 

Adjusting scores accordingly:

1. Genetic engineering: 5
2. VR: 6
3. 3D printing: 7
4. Internet: 8 (since ARPANET was 60s, but internet as we know it in 90s)
5. Telephone: 9 (mass adoption in 20th)
6. Light bulb: 7 (invented late 19th, but widespread in 20th)
7. Radio: 9 (key in 20th)
8. Airplane: 10 (core example like helicopter)

Wait, but helicopter is an example, so airplane would be similar. So airplane is a direct example. So maybe airplane is 10. Helicopter is an example, so airplane would also be. 

But the anti-examples are things like quantum computing (future tech), AI (field more than device), blockchain (digital ledger). So the theme is physical devices from the 20th century that have had major impact. 

So the candidates:

1. Genetic Engineering: Not a physical device, more a process. Maybe 4?
2. Virtual Reality: Hardware exists but maybe considered more modern (though headsets in 90s). Maybe 6?
3. 3D Printing: 80s, but not as mainstream as the examples. Maybe 7?
4. Internet: Infrastructure, but not a physical device. Maybe 5? Wait, but wireless communication is an example, which is a system. Hmm. Maybe the theme includes systems. Then internet would be 8.
5. Telephone: Definitely 9 or 10.
6. Electric Light Bulb: 19th century, so maybe 6?
7. Radio: 1900s, so 9?
8. Airplane: 10.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let's try to set the theme clearly. The examples are all physical technologies from the 20th century that are foundational in their fields. So:

- Personal computer (1970s-80s)
- Wireless communication (radio in early 20th, cellular in late 20th)
- Helicopter (mid 20th)

So the theme is mid to late 20th century physical technologies. Then:

1. Genetic engineering (1970s): Is it a physical tech? It's more of a biotech process. Maybe a 5.
2. Virtual reality (1980s tech, but not as foundational as the examples): 6.
3. 3D printing (1980s): 7.
4. Internet (1960s, but maybe considered part of the theme as a system): 8.
5. Telephone (19th century invention, but mass use in 20th): 9.
6. Electric light bulb (19th century): 6.
7. Radio (early 20th): 9.
8. Airplane (early 20th): 9.

But airplane is from the early 20th, similar to radio. Helicopter is mid-20th. So maybe airplane is 9, radio 9, telephone 9. 

Wait, the examples include helicopter (mid-20th), so maybe the cutoff is that they are from the 20th century, regardless of when in it. So the theme is "20th century technologies that are physical and have had a major impact." 

Then:

- Genetic engineering: 1970s, physical (like lab equipment) but maybe more applied science. 6?
- VR: 1980s, devices exist. 7?
- 3D printing: 1980s. 7?
- Internet: 1960s, but maybe considered part of the theme. 8?
- Telephone: 19th invention but 20th adoption. 9?
- Light bulb: 19th, so 5?
- Radio: early 20th. 9?
- Airplane: early 20th. 10?

Hmm, I think the key is that the examples are all 20th-century inventions with physical manifestations and major impacts. The anti-examples are either earlier (like light bulb), or more abstract (AI, blockchain), or future tech (quantum computing). 

So:

1. Genetic Engineering: 1970s, but not a device per se. Maybe 6.
2. VR: Devices, but maybe 6-7.
3. 3D printing: 7.
4. Internet: 8 (as infrastructure).
5. Telephone: 9.
6. Light bulb: 5.
7. Radio: 9.
8. Airplane: 10.

Wait, the helicopter is an example, so airplane is a direct example. So airplane would be 10. 

Finalizing the scores:

1. Genetic engineering: 5
2. Virtual reality: 6
3. 3D printing:7
4. Internet:8
5. Telephone:9
6. Electric light bulb:6 (since it's late 19th but widely used in 20th)
Wait, electric light bulb's invention was late 19th, but its widespread adoption was early 20th. Maybe 7?

Hmm, maybe:

6. Electric light bulb: 7?

But let me check again. The examples include helicopter (mid 20th), PC (late 20th), wireless (early and late). So maybe the theme is "20th-century technologies that are physical and have had significant practical applications." 

Electric light bulb is from 1870s, so technically 19th century, so lower score. Maybe 4?

Then:

1. Genetic Engineering: 5
2. VR:6
3. 3D:7
4. Internet:8
5. Telephone:9
6. Light bulb:4
7. Radio:9
8. Airplane:10

That seems better. 

So the final scores would be:

1. 5

2. 6

3.7

4.8

5.9

6.4

7.9

8.10
