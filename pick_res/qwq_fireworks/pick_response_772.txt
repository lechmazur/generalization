Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the examples given: the abacus, the pyramid, and the sundial. Then, I have to determine why the anti-examples (spaceship, time machine, terraforming device) don't fit that theme but might fit a broader one. Finally, I need to evaluate each candidate against that specific theme, scoring them from 0 to 10.

Starting with the examples. The abacus is an ancient calculating tool, the pyramid is an ancient structure, and the sundial is an ancient timekeeping device. They all seem to be ancient, practical tools or structures that were used in pre-industrial or ancient civilizations. They represent early human innovations that solved specific problems using available materials and knowledge at the time. They are also tangible, physical objects with a clear, specific function.

Now the anti-examples: a spaceship, time machine, and terraforming device. These are all futuristic or speculative technologies. They don't exist in the same ancient, practical sense as the examples. Instead, they represent advanced, perhaps even science-fictional concepts that go beyond what was possible in ancient times. So the specific theme isn't just "tools" or "inventions" in general, but specifically ancient or historical tools/structures that are grounded in real human history, not futuristic or imaginary.

So the theme must be something like "ancient, practical, tangible tools or structures that were actual historical inventions, serving a functional purpose in their time." 

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Flying car: This is a modern or futuristic concept. While cars are real, flying cars are not common and are more speculative. Doesn't fit the ancient theme. Score low, maybe 2?

Wait, but maybe I need to think again. The examples are all ancient, so anything not from that era would be out. Flying cars are definitely not ancient. So probably 0-3.

2. The wheel: The wheel is ancient, a foundational invention. It's a practical tool used in many cultures. Definitely fits the theme. So maybe 10? But wait, the examples given (abacus, pyramid, sundial) are all more specific. The wheel is even more basic and ancient. Hmm, maybe 10 is okay. But maybe the examples are all specific tools, whereas the wheel is a general invention. The pyramid uses the wheel concept in construction? Not sure. Alternatively, the wheel is a classic ancient invention. So perhaps 10.

Wait, but the anti-examples include a spaceship, so the wheel is a real ancient invention, so it should be a good fit. Let me hold that thought.

3. Holographic assistant: Definitely futuristic tech, like a hologram but with AI. Not ancient. So low, maybe 1.

4. Nanobot: Tiny robots, nanotechnology is modern and sci-fi. Not ancient. So 0 or 1.

5. Hologram: Again, modern tech. Though holograms exist, they're not ancient. Maybe 2?

Wait, the sundial is a timekeeping device, the abacus is for calculation, pyramid is a structure. The hologram doesn't serve a functional, practical purpose in the same ancient context. So 1?

6. Robot: Robots are modern. Even ancient automatons existed, but maybe not as we know them. The examples are all non-mechanical except the abacus. The robot is more advanced. So maybe 2? Or perhaps 0.

Wait, there were some ancient automatons using hydraulics or gears, but those are more like the abacus? Maybe a robot is too advanced. So low score, maybe 1.

7. Virtual reality headset: Definitely modern, high-tech. 0.

8. Jetpack: Futuristic, not ancient. 0-2.

Wait, but let me reassess each candidate carefully.

The theme is ancient, practical, tangible tools/structures. So:

1. Flying car: Not ancient. 0.

2. The wheel: Ancient, practical, yes. 10.

3. Holographic assistant: Futuristic, so 0.

4. Nanobot: Modern sci-fi. 0.

5. Hologram: Modern. 0.

6. Robot: Unless considering ancient automatons, but robots as we know them are modern. 0 or 1.

Wait, maybe some ancient devices like the Antikythera mechanism, but that's more like an analog computer. A robot is different. So 0.

7. VR headset: 0.

8. Jetpack: 0.

Wait but the anti-examples include a time machine (futuristic) and spaceship (same), so the theme is definitely not futuristic. So the candidates that are futuristic get 0. But maybe some have a closer connection?

Wait, perhaps I misjudged the wheel. The examples include the wheel's applications (like in pyramids?), but the wheel itself is an example. Since the examples given (abacus, pyramid, sundial) are all specific items, the wheel is a valid ancient invention. So 10.

Wait, but the user's examples don't include the wheel, but the task is to find the theme based on the given examples. The theme is not "ancient inventions" per se, but perhaps more specific. Let's re-examine the examples:

Abacus: a calculating tool.

Pyramid: a monumental structure, often for burial or religious purposes.

Sundial: a timekeeping device.

So they are all tools or structures that served a specific, practical function in their time, and are ancient. The common thread is ancient, functional, tangible tools/structures.

The anti-examples are all futuristic, so the key is "ancient".

Now the candidates:

1. Flying car: Futuristic, 0.

2. Wheel: Ancient, yes, so 10.

3. Holographic assistant: Modern tech, 0.

4. Nanobot: Modern, 0.

5. Hologram: Modern, 0.

6. Robot: Modern, unless considering ancient automatons (e.g., some Greek or Chinese water clocks with moving figures). But robots as autonomous machines are modern. Maybe 1?

Wait, the ancient automatons were more like simple mechanisms, not robots. So 0.

7. VR headset: 0.

8. Jetpack: 0.

Hmm, but maybe I should consider if any candidates are closer. For example, a hologram might be seen as an advanced form of a sundial (time) or abacus (calculation) but in a modern sense. But that's stretching. The theme is specifically the exact theme, so they have to be ancient.

Wait, the wheel is definitely a perfect fit. The others are all modern, so 0 except maybe the wheel at 10. But the user's examples don't include the wheel, but the theme would allow it. So the scores would be:

1. 0

2. 10

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

But that's only 0 and 10. The user said to use the full range, not just polarized. Hmm, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, perhaps the theme is not strictly "ancient" but something else. Let me re-examine the examples and anti-examples again.

Examples: abacus (ancient calculating tool), pyramid (ancient structure), sundial (ancient timekeeping). All are non-mechanical except the abacus? Wait, the abacus is mechanical. All are physical, tangible, and serve a functional purpose. The anti-examples are all futuristic or conceptual (spaceship, time machine, terraforming device). So maybe the theme is "physical, tangible tools/structures from ancient times that serve a specific, practical function".

If so, then candidates need to be ancient, physical, functional.

The candidates:

1. Flying car: Not ancient. 0.

2. Wheel: Ancient, yes. 10.

3. Holographic assistant: Modern tech. 0.

4. Nanobot: Modern. 0.

5. Hologram: Modern. 0.

6. Robot: Modern. Unless considering ancient automatons, but robots are a stretch. 0.

7. VR headset: Modern. 0.

8. Jetpack: Modern. 0.

But the user wants scores from 0-10 with nuance, so maybe some candidates are partially related. For example, the wheel is a perfect 10. What about the robot? If there was an ancient automaton, maybe a low score. But the robot as we know it is modern. Maybe 1? Or 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "tools that measure or calculate something" (abacus, sundial), and pyramids as structures. Hmm, but pyramids aren't measuring tools. Maybe the theme is "tools/structures that were fundamental in their time for specific purposes". Then wheel is a clear yes (10). The robot is a tool but modern. So maybe 0.

Wait, perhaps I missed another angle. The examples are all ancient, but maybe the theme is "tools that were used in a specific way, like calculation, timekeeping, or monumental construction". So:

- Abacus: calculation

- Sundial: timekeeping

- Pyramid: monumental construction (burial, religious)

So the theme could be "tools or structures that served a specific, significant societal function in ancient times". 

Thus, candidates need to fit that.

Looking again:

1. Flying car: Futuristic transport, not societal function in ancient times. 0.

2. Wheel: Definitely a societal function, 10.

3. Holographic assistant: Modern, not societal function in ancient times. 0.

4. Nanobot: Modern, not. 0.

5. Hologram: Modern. 0.

6. Robot: Not ancient. 0.

7. VR headset: 0.

8. Jetpack: 0.

Hmm, but maybe some candidates are closer? For example, the hologram might be seen as an advanced form of a sundial (displaying information), but it's modern. So still 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "tools that are manually operated and don't require advanced technology". The abacus is manual, sundial uses sun, pyramids built manually. The anti-examples are powered or futuristic tech. So:

Flying car (powered) → 0.

Wheel (manual) → 10.

Holographic assistant (electric) → 0.

Nanobot (advanced tech) → 0.

Hologram (electric) → 0.

Robot (powered) → 0.

VR headset (electric) → 0.

Jetpack (powered) → 0.

Still same scores.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that are non-electronic and mechanical or simple". The abacus is mechanical, sundial is simple, pyramids are built with simple tools. Anti-examples use advanced tech.

Thus, candidates:

Flying car (electronic/advanced) → 0.

Wheel (mechanical) → 10.

Holographic assistant (electronic) → 0.

Nanobot (nano-tech) → 0.

Hologram (electronic) → 0.

Robot (electronic) → 0.

VR (electronic) →0.

Jetpack (fuel-powered) → 0.

Still, only 0 and 10. But the user wants scores across the range. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the theme is "tools that were used in a specific historical context for a purpose that's now obsolete or replaced by modern tech". For example, abacus replaced by calculators, sundial by clocks, pyramids by modern buildings. But the anti-examples are future tech, so maybe the theme is "historical tools that have been replaced by modern equivalents". 

If so, then candidates:

Flying car: Not historical, 0.

Wheel: Still used, so maybe 0? But that contradicts.

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't right.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "tools that are non-portable or large-scale". The abacus is small, though. The pyramid is large, the sundial can be small. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that are symbolic of human progress or milestones". The examples are milestones in their fields. The anti-examples are futuristic milestones not yet achieved. So candidates like wheel (milestone) would be 10. Others are either not milestones (like flying car) or futuristic (so 0).

Still 0 and 10.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all tools that are manually operated and don't rely on energy sources beyond human or natural (like sun for sundial). So wheel is human-powered, abacus manual, pyramids built manually. The anti-examples use fuels or advanced energy (spaceship, terraforming devices).

Thus, candidates:

Flying car (needs fuel) →0.

Wheel →10.

Holographic (electric) →0.

Nanobot (requires energy) →0.

Hologram (electric) →0.

Robot (powered) →0.

VR (electric) →0.

Jetpack (fuel) →0.

Still 0 and 10.

Hmm. The problem states that the anti-examples can follow a broader theme but not the exact one. So maybe the theme isn't just "ancient" but something else that the examples share more specifically.

Looking again at the examples: abacus (calculation tool), pyramid (monumental structure), sundial (timekeeping). All are tools or structures that were used in ancient times to solve specific problems or serve societal needs. They are all physical, non-electronic, and rely on natural elements (like the sun for sundial, human effort for abacus, materials for pyramids).

The anti-examples are all futuristic, involving advanced tech or concepts beyond the scope of ancient times. So the theme is "ancient, practical, physical tools or structures that served a specific societal function without advanced technology".

Thus, candidates must be ancient, physical, functional, non-futuristic.

Now, candidates:

1. Flying car: Not ancient, uses advanced tech →0.

2. Wheel: Ancient, functional →10.

3. Holographic assistant: Modern tech →0.

4. Nanobot: Modern →0.

5. Hologram: Modern →0.

6. Robot: Modern →0.

7. VR headset: Modern →0.

8. Jetpack: Modern →0.

But the user wants scores spread out. Maybe some candidates are partially related but not exact. For example, the wheel is perfect (10). What about the robot? If there was an ancient automaton, maybe a low score. But robots are modern. So maybe 1? Or 0.

Alternatively, maybe the wheel is 10, and others all 0 except some others?

Wait, perhaps the hologram is a form of a sundial (displaying info via light), but it's modern. So maybe 1?

Or maybe the holographic assistant is like a more advanced abacus (tool for assistance), but still modern. So 1?

Similarly, the robot could be considered a more advanced abacus (tool for calculation/ work), but it's modern. So 1?

But that's stretching. The user wants exact theme matching. So perhaps only the wheel is 10, others 0. But that's only two scores.

Wait, maybe I missed a candidate. Let me check again:

The candidates are:

1. Flying car

2. The wheel

3. Holographic assistant

4. a nanobot

5. a hologram

6. a robot

7. a virtual reality headset

8. a jetpack

Hmm. All are modern except the wheel. So unless there's another angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "tools that are manually operated and don't require electricity". So:

Wheel is manual →10.

Flying car uses fuel →0.

Holographic assistant uses electricity →0.

Nanobot → electricity →0.

Hologram → electricity →0.

Robot → electricity →0.

VR → electricity →0.

Jetpack → fuel →0.

Still same.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that are used in education or measurement" (abacus for math, sundial for time). Pyramid is more a structure, but maybe for ceremonial purposes. Maybe not.

Alternatively, the theme could be "tools or structures that are iconic symbols of their era". The examples are iconic of ancient times. The anti-examples are icons of the future. Candidates need to be icons of past eras.

So:

Wheel is an icon of ancient times →10.

Flying car is an icon of future →0.

Holographic assistant → future →0.

Nanobot → modern →0.

Hologram → modern →0.

Robot → modern →0.

VR → modern →0.

Jetpack → future →0.

Still 0 and 10.

Hmm. The user insists on using the full range of scores. Maybe I'm missing something in the theme.

Wait, the examples are all physical objects. The anti-examples include a time machine (abstract concept?), but maybe they're all physical. Hmm, time machine is a device. Maybe the theme is "physical devices that were used in ancient times for practical purposes".

So:

Wheel → yes →10.

Flying car → modern →0.

Hologram → modern tech →0.

Nanobot → modern →0.

Robot → modern →0.

VR → modern →0.

Jetpack → modern →0.

Holographic assistant → modern →0.

Still the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "tools that use natural elements (sun, water, gravity, etc.)". The sundial uses sun, abacus uses human hands, pyramids use gravity/materials. Anti-examples use advanced tech (spaceship uses engines, terraforming uses tech).

Thus:

Wheel uses materials and human power →10.

Flying car uses fuel →0.

Hologram uses electricity →0.

Etc.

Same result.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that are manually powered". So wheel (human or animal), abacus (manual), sundial (sun), pyramid (built manually). Thus, candidates:

Flying car (engine) →0.

Wheel →10.

Hologram (electric) →0.

Same.

Hmm. The user might have a different angle. Maybe the examples are all "tools that have a direct, tangible output" (abacus shows numbers, sundial shows time, pyramids as structures). The anti-examples are more conceptual or abstract (time machine changes time, terraforming changes planets).

Thus, candidates:

Wheel produces movement →10.

Flying car produces transport → but it's modern →0.

Hologram produces image → modern →0.

Same.

Alternatively, the theme could be "tools that were used before the industrial revolution". So wheel yes (pre-industrial), others are post-industrial →0.

Still same.

Hmm. I think the only candidate that fits is the wheel, so it gets 10. The rest are all modern or futuristic, so 0. But the user wants scores spread out. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the theme is "tools that are used for calculation, timekeeping, or monumental construction". Thus:

Wheel is not in that category. Oops, that's a problem. The examples are abacus (calculation), sundial (time), pyramid (monument). So the theme is those three categories. So the wheel is not in those categories. Then the wheel would not be a 10. That changes things.

Wait, that's a different approach. Let me think again.

If the theme is "tools used for calculation, timekeeping, or monumental architecture", then:

Abacus (calculation), sundial (time), pyramid (monument). So the theme is those three specific functions.

Anti-examples are spaceship (transport?), time machine (time travel, not timekeeping), terraforming (environmental change).

Thus, the theme is tools for calculation, timekeeping, or monumental construction.

Then candidates:

1. Flying car → transport, not in the three categories →0.

2. Wheel → transport, not in the categories →0.

3. Holographic assistant → maybe calculation? Not directly. 0.

4. Nanobot → various uses, not in categories →0.

5. Hologram → display, not in categories →0.

6. Robot → various, not →0.

7. VR → virtual environment, not →0.

8. Jetpack → transport →0.

But then none would get high scores except maybe none. That can't be. So that approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that are ancient and have a direct, physical function", so wheel qualifies, giving it a 10, others 0. But user wants nuanced scores.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "tools that are simple and non-electronic". Then wheel is 10. Flying car is electronic? Maybe not, but uses fuel. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that don't require electricity". Wheel is 10, flying car uses fuel →0. Hologram uses electricity →0. Etc.

Still same.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that the examples are all ancient, but the candidates might have some historical basis but not as ancient as the examples. For instance, the wheel is ancient (so 10), but maybe something like the robot could be a 1 if considering ancient automatons. But robots are modern.

Alternatively, the hologram might score 1 because it's a form of timekeeping (like a sundial) but modern. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that are used in education or practical tasks". Abacus for math, sundial for time, pyramid for construction. So wheel is practical →10. Holographic assistant could be educational →1? But it's modern. Maybe 1.

Similarly, robot could be practical but modern →1.

VR headset for education →1.

Jetpack for transport → maybe 1? But it's futuristic.

But this is speculative. The user wants exact theme, so I should stick to the ancient aspect.

Given that, I'll proceed with wheel as 10 and others 0 except maybe some getting 1 for being somewhat related but not exact.

Wait, the anti-examples are supposed to be in a broader theme. The theme for anti-examples might be "tools or devices that are advanced or futuristic", so the candidates that are modern but not futuristic might get a low score but not zero? Like, a hologram is modern tech but not as futuristic as a time machine, so maybe 1?

Alternatively, the wheel is 10, and others are 0 except maybe some like hologram (2?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that are manually operated". So wheel is manual, flying car is engine-driven →0. Hologram requires power →0. So only wheel is 10. Others 0.

Hmm. I think I have to go with that. The user might accept 10 for wheel and 0 for others, but the instruction says to use the full range. Maybe I'm missing another candidate.

Wait, candidate 6: a robot. If there were ancient automatons, like the ones in ancient Greece (e.g., water clocks with moving figures), maybe a robot is a distant cousin, so a 1?

Similarly, the holographic assistant might be a form of an abacus for assistance (though modern), so 1.

The hologram could be a modern version of a sundial (displaying information via light), so 1.

VR headset might be like a modern abacus for learning, 1.

Jetpack is transport like the wheel, but modern →1.

Flying car is transport but more advanced →0.

Nanobot is too advanced →0.

So scores:

1. 0

2. 10

3. 1

4. 0

5. 1

6. 1

7. 1

8. 1

This uses more scores but not the full range. Maybe some get higher.

Alternatively, maybe the wheel is 10, hologram 2 (closer to sundial), robot 1 (ancient automatons), VR 1, etc. But this is arbitrary.

Alternatively, consider that the theme is "ancient tools that are simple and have a clear functional purpose". The wheel fits (10). A hologram (modern, not simple) →0. A robot (complex) →0. But maybe the holographic assistant is less advanced than a time machine, so 3? Not sure.

Alternatively, the scores could be:

Wheel: 10

Flying car:0

Holographic:1

Nanobot:0

Hologram:1

Robot:1

VR:1

Jetpack:0

Still not using the full range. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the user might expect the theme to be "ancient calculating or measuring devices plus monumental structures". Thus:

Abacus (calculation), sundial (measurement), pyramid (structure). So candidates must be in those categories.

Wheel is a structure/tool but not in those categories → maybe 5? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the theme is "ancient tools used in science or engineering". Thus:

Wheel is engineering →10.

Hologram → modern science →0.

Alternatively, this is too vague.

Given time constraints, I'll proceed with wheel as 10 and others 0 except maybe some get 1-2.

Final answer:

1.0

2.10

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants the full range. Maybe the theme is different.

Wait another angle: the examples are all "tools that have been replaced by modern technology" (abacus by calculator, sundial by clock, pyramid by skyscrapers). So the theme is "tools that are obsolete due to modern tech".

Thus:

Wheel is still used →0.

Flying car → not obsolete →0.

Holographic → modern →0.

Nanobot → modern →0.

Hologram → modern →0.

Robot → modern →0.

VR → modern →0.

Jetpack → not common →0.

So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the examples are all ancient, I think wheel is 10, others 0. But the user wants scores across 0-10. Maybe I should assign some low scores for being closer to the theme's aspects but not exact.

For instance:

Wheel:10

Flying car:0

Holographic:1 (modern tech but similar to a tool)

Nanobot:0

Hologram:1

Robot:1

VR:1

Jetpack:0

Still not using the full range. Alternatively, maybe the wheel is 10, and others like hologram get 2, VR 3, etc., based on how futuristic they are compared to anti-examples.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "physical tools that have a clear, single function". Wheel has a function (movement), so 10. Flying car (transport) but modern → maybe 5? But that's not ancient.

Hmm, I think I have to proceed with wheel as 10 and others 0-2. Since the user wants the full range, perhaps I'm missing a different theme.

Wait, another angle: the examples are all "tools that are manually operated and don't require energy beyond human/animal power or natural elements". So wheel (human power), abacus (human), sundial (sun), pyramid (built with human/animal). Anti-examples require advanced energy (spaceship fuel, terraforming tech).

Thus:

Wheel:10

Flying car (fuel) →0.

Hologram (electricity) →0.

Nanobot (electricity) →0.

Robot (electricity) →0.

VR (electricity) →0.

Jetpack (fuel) →0.

Holographic assistant (electricity) →0.

Thus, only wheel 10, others 0. But user wants spread.

Perhaps the theme is "tools that are physical and not digital". Wheel yes →10. Others are digital or advanced →0-2.

Hologram is digital →0.

Holographic assistant is digital →0.

VR is digital →0.

Thus, still.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that are made of simple materials". Wheel is simple →10. Flying car has complex materials →0. Hologram → complex →0.

Still.

Hmm. I think I'll proceed with wheel as 10, others 0 except maybe some get 1 for being slightly related but not exactly.

So final scores:

1.0

2.10

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user says to use the full range. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the theme. Let me try once more.

Perhaps the theme is "tools that are used for calculation, timekeeping, or construction". Thus:

Wheel is construction →10.

Abacus (calculation), sundial (time), pyramid (construction).

Candidates:

Flying car: transport →0.

Holographic: maybe calculation? →1.

Nanobot: construction? →2.

Hologram: time? →1.

Robot: construction? →3.

VR: education →1.

Jetpack: transport →0.

Thus:

1.0

2.10

3.1

4.2

5.1

6.3

7.1

8.0

This uses a wider range. Maybe this is better. The theme would be the three functions: calculation, timekeeping, construction.

So:

Wheel (construction) →10.

Nanobot (construction) →2.

Robot (construction) →3.

Hologram (timekeeping?) →1.

Holographic assistant (calculation?) →1.

VR (education, not in theme) →0?

Hmm, but this requires the theme to be those three functions. Maybe this is the right approach.

Thus, final scores based on that:

1. Flying car →0 (transport)

2. Wheel →10 (construction)

3. Holographic assistant →1 (calculation?)

4. Nanobot →2 (construction)

5. Hologram →1 (timekeeping?)

6. Robot →3 (construction)

7. VR →0 (not in theme)

8. Jetpack →0 (transport)

This uses scores 0,1,2,3,10. Not full range but better.

Alternatively, maybe:

- Construction: wheel (10), robot (3), nanobot (2), jetpack (0, not construction)

- Timekeeping: hologram (2), sundial's theme → hologram as modern time? →2.

- Calculation: holographic assistant (1), abacus's theme →1.

- VR:0.

- Flying car:0.

- Nanobot:2.

- Robot:3.

Thus:

1.0

2.10

3.1

4.2

5.2

6.3

7.0

8.0

This gives scores up to 3 and 10. Maybe better.

Alternatively, if hologram is timekeeping (like sundial), then 3.

Nanobot could be construction (like pyramid) →3.

Robot construction →4.

Thus:

Wheel 10

Robot 4

Nanobot 3

Hologram 2

Holographic assistant 1

Others 0.

This uses 0,1,2,3,4,10.

Better.

Final decision based on that:

Wheel is 10.

Robot (construction) →4.

Nanobot (construction) →3.

Hologram (timekeeping) →2.

Holographic assistant (calculation) →1.

Others 0.

Thus:

1.0

2.10

3.1

4.3

5.2

6.4

7.0

8.0

This uses scores 0,1,2,3,4,10.

This seems plausible. I'll go with this approach.
