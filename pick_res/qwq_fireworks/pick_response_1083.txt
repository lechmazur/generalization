Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are Fermilab named after Fermi, Rockefeller Center after Rockefeller, and Hoover Dam after Hoover. The anti-examples are Washington DC, Lincoln Memorial, and Jefferson City. The key here is to see what's common in the examples that isn't in the anti-examples.

Looking at the examples, all are places or structures named after a person, but they are not memorials or capitals. Fermilab is a laboratory, Rockefeller Center is a complex, Hoover Dam is a dam. The anti-examples include a capital city (Washington DC), a memorial (Lincoln Memorial), and another capital (Jefferson City). So maybe the theme is places named after a person but not being a memorial or a capital city. Also, perhaps the named individuals are not presidents? Because the anti-examples include presidents (Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson), while the examples are a scientist, a businessman, and a president (Herbert Hoover, but he's not as prominently a president in the same way as the others maybe? Wait, Hoover was a president, so that complicates it. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the key is that the examples are named after the person during their lifetime? Let me check. Hoover Dam was named after Herbert Hoover, who was president before the dam was built. I think he was president when the project started, but maybe the naming happened while he was in office. Whereas Washington DC was named posthumously. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the examples are named after people who are not political figures but in other fields? Fermi was a scientist, Rockefeller a businessman, Hoover a politician but maybe the others are more about non-political roles? But Hoover was a president. Hmm.

Alternatively, the anti-examples are all named after people who are directly related to the place's purpose. For example, Washington DC is the capital named after the first president, Lincoln Memorial is a memorial to him, Jefferson City is named after the third president. The examples are named after people but the places aren't memorials or capitals. So the theme might be: a place named after a person who is not a political leader (president) and the place is not a memorial or capital. Or the key is that the name comes from a person's surname attached to the type of place, like Fermilab (Fermi + lab), Rockefeller Center (Rockefeller + center), Hoover Dam (Hoover + dam). The anti-examples are named after presidents, but their names are part of the city or memorial name. So maybe the theme is that the place is a structure or facility named after a person (not a memorial or capital) where the person's surname is combined with the type of place (e.g., Fermilab = Fermi + lab). 

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Eiffel Tower: designed by Gustave Eiffel. Named after him, and it's a tower. So fits the structure named after a person's surname plus the structure type. So this should be a high score, maybe 10? But wait, the examples are all named after the person, but the Eiffel Tower is named after the designer. The examples like Fermilab might be named after someone important in the field. So this seems to fit the theme. But let's check others.

2. Mount Vernon: George Washington's home. The name Mount Vernon was his estate, but it's named after his family's estate in England. Wait, actually, George Washington named his estate after Baron Ferdinand Fairfax, whose title was Lord of Mount Vernon. So it's not named after Washington himself. Therefore, this doesn't fit the theme. The theme requires the place to be named after the person. Since Mount Vernon isn't named after Washington, this is an anti-example. So score low, maybe 0 or 1?

3. Graceland: Elvis Presley's home. The name Graceland was the name of the estate when he bought it, but he popularized it. The original owner named it Graceland. So it's not named after Elvis. So this is similar to Mount Vernon. So low score, maybe 0.

4. Monticello: Thomas Jefferson's home. The name Monticello comes from Italian meaning "little mountain," so it wasn't named after Jefferson. So again, not named after the person, so low score. Maybe 0 or 1.

5. Chrysler Building: named after Walter Chrysler. This fits the theme: a building named after a person (Chrysler) who was a businessman (like Rockefeller). So this should be a 10? But wait, the examples include Hoover Dam, which is a dam named after a president. Wait, Hoover was a president, but in the anti-examples, the problem was that they were capitals or memorials. Chrysler Building is a building named after the company's head, so this fits. So maybe 10.

6. Ford's Theatre: where Lincoln was assassinated. The theatre was named after John T. Ford, the owner, not Lincoln. So the name is after Ford, but the anti-examples include Lincoln Memorial (named after Lincoln). Wait, the theatre's name is Ford's, so the person is Ford, not Lincoln. So this is a structure named after someone, so maybe fits? But Ford's Theatre is named after the owner, so similar to Chrysler. But the anti-examples include Lincoln Memorial which is a memorial. Ford's Theatre isn't a memorial, it's a theatre. So maybe this fits the theme. Wait, but the name is after Ford, so it's a structure named after a person. So maybe 10? Wait, but the anti-examples include Jefferson City, which is a capital named after a president. Ford's Theatre isn't a capital or memorial, so it should fit. Hmm, but maybe the theme requires that the person's surname is combined with the structure type. Chrysler Building: Chrysler (surname) + Building. Ford's Theatre: Ford (surname) + Theatre. So that fits. So maybe 10?

But wait, the examples include Hoover Dam, named after a president (Herbert Hoover). So even though Hoover was a president, the key is not being a memorial or capital. Since Ford's Theatre is a theatre named after someone, not a memorial, so it fits. So maybe 10? But let me check others first.

7. Carnegie Hall: named after Andrew Carnegie. This is a hall named after him, so fits exactly like the examples. So 10.

8. Shakespeare's Globe: reconstruction of the original theatre. The original Globe Theatre was named after the globe (symbol of the world), but the reconstruction is called Shakespeare's Globe to honor Shakespeare. So it's named after Shakespeare, but the original wasn't. The current name is to associate with Shakespeare. So is this named after him? Yes. The structure is a theatre named after Shakespeare, so similar to the examples. But Shakespeare wasn't a political figure, and it's not a capital or memorial. So maybe 10? Wait, but the original Globe wasn't named after him. The new one is, so it's a bit different. Maybe a 9?

Wait, but let's reassess the theme again. The examples are all places named after a person, the person's surname combined with the structure type (Fermi + lab, Rockefeller + center, Hoover + dam). The anti-examples are named after presidents, but also they are capitals or memorials. So the key elements are:

- Named after a person (not a memorial or capital)
- The name is a combination of the person's surname and the structure's type (e.g., Fermi + lab = Fermilab)

So checking candidates again with this in mind:

1. Eiffel Tower: Eiffel (surname) + Tower. Perfect fit. 10.

2. Mount Vernon: Not named after Washington, so 0.

3. Graceland: Not named after Elvis, so 0.

4. Monticello: Not named after Jefferson, so 0.

5. Chrysler Building: Chrysler + Building. 10.

6. Ford's Theatre: Ford + Theatre. 10.

7. Carnegie Hall: Carnegie + Hall. 10.

8. Shakespeare's Globe: Shakespeare's + Globe. The structure is a theatre, but the name is "Shakespeare's Globe", which combines the person's name with the theatre's name. So it fits the pattern. 10?

Wait, but the original Globe wasn't named after Shakespeare. The new one is, so maybe it's a bit of a stretch. The original was called the Globe, and the new one added "Shakespeare's" to distinguish. So perhaps it's named after him, but the structure's primary type is a theatre. So maybe 9? Or is the name "Shakespeare's Globe" considered the structure's name, so combining the person and the structure (Globe as the structure, but with Shakespeare's). Hmm, maybe 8?

Alternatively, the examples have the surname directly attached to the structure type (Fermilab = Fermi + lab). Here, "Shakespeare's" is possessive, so maybe less direct. So perhaps 8.

Wait, but "Rockefeller Center" is Rockefeller + Center, which is possessive? No, it's Rockefeller Center, not Rockefeller's Center. So maybe "Shakespeare's Globe" is possessive, which might be a slight difference. So perhaps it's a 9 instead of 10.

Alternatively, maybe all the examples are proper nouns without the apostrophe s. So "Shakespeare's" might be a bit different. So maybe 9.

But let's see the other candidates. If the first five are 10 except for 2,3,4, then maybe Shakespeare's is a 9. Alternatively, maybe 8.

Wait, let me think again. The key is the structure's name combines the person's surname with the structure type. For example:

- Fermilab (Fermi + lab)
- Rockefeller Center (Rockefeller + Center)
- Hoover Dam (Hoover + Dam)

So the structure's name is [Person's surname] + [type], without possessive. 

Shakespeare's Globe has "Shakespeare's" (possessive) plus Globe (which is the original name of the theatre). So the structure's type here is "Globe" (theatre), but the name includes "Shakespeare's" as an owner/attributive. So maybe it's a bit different. So perhaps it's a 7 or 8. Alternatively, since it's named after Shakespeare, even with the possessive, it still fits the theme of being named after a person, so maybe 9.

Alternatively, maybe the anti-examples include "Lincoln Memorial" which is a memorial named after him. So if a place is named after someone, but not a memorial or capital, then Shakespeare's Globe is a theatre named after him, so it fits. The structure's type is theatre (Globe), so combining the name. So perhaps 10.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me check others first.

So for candidate 6, Ford's Theatre: the name is "Ford's Theatre", which is possessive (Ford's) plus Theatre. So similar structure to Shakespeare's Globe. So if we consider that as acceptable, then both 6 and 8 would be similar. So if Ford's Theatre is a 10, then Shakespeare's Globe should be the same. But maybe the original theatre was named Ford's, so it's named after the owner, John T. Ford. So the name is Ford's (possessive) Theatre, which is similar to the examples. So maybe they are both 10.

Wait, but the examples don't have possessive forms. So maybe the possessive form is a slight difference. But the key is that the place is named after the person. So if it's named after Ford or Shakespeare, then it should count. So perhaps 10 for both 6 and 8.

Wait, but let's check the anti-examples again. The anti-examples include "Jefferson City", which is a city named after Jefferson. So a city named after a person, but it's a capital. So the theme excludes capitals. But Ford's Theatre isn't a capital, so it's okay. So Ford's Theatre is a theatre named after Ford, so it fits the theme. So 10.

Shakespeare's Globe is a theatre named after Shakespeare, so also fits, so 10.

Wait, but the original Globe wasn't named after Shakespeare, but the reconstruction is. So the name "Shakespeare's Globe" is to honor him, so it's named after him. Therefore, it should be 10.

So perhaps all the candidates except 2,3,4 are 10. But that can't be right because the user wants a range of scores.

Wait, let me check the candidates again:

Looking at candidate 1: Eiffel Tower – perfect fit (surname + structure type), so 10.

Candidate 5: Chrysler Building – surname + building, 10.

Candidate 7: Carnegie Hall – surname + hall, 10.

Candidate 6: Ford's Theatre – surname's + theatre. The possessive might be a slight difference, but still named after Ford. So maybe 9?

Candidate 8: Shakespeare's Globe – same as Ford's, so 9.

Alternatively, maybe the possessive is considered less direct, so those get 9, others 10.

Alternatively, maybe "Shakespeare's Globe" is more of a descriptive name rather than a proper name. Hmm, but it's the official name. So maybe 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the anti-examples include memorials. The Lincoln Memorial is a memorial, so named after him. If the theme excludes memorials, then any place named after someone as a memorial would be excluded. But Shakespeare's Globe isn't a memorial; it's a theatre. So it's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the theme requires that the person was alive when the place was named, but I don't think the examples specify that.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the place is named after a person who is not a political leader. Hoover was a president, so that's in the examples. So that can't be the rule.

Alternatively, the key is that the examples are all named after a person in their lifetime? Let's see:

- Fermilab: Fermi was alive when it was named? Fermilab was established in 1967, Fermi died in 1954. So named posthumously.

Rockefeller Center: Named after John D. Rockefeller, who died in 1937, but the complex was built in the 1930s. So named during his lifetime? Rockefeller died in 1937, and construction started in 1930s, so maybe named while he was alive? Not sure.

Hoover Dam: Named after Herbert Hoover, who was president from 1929-1933. The dam was authorized in 1928, construction started 1931. Named while he was president, so yes, during his lifetime.

So maybe the examples are named during the person's lifetime, but the anti-examples like Washington DC was named posthumously (Washington died in 1799, DC established in 1800). So if the theme requires being named during the person's lifetime, then:

- Eiffel Tower: Eiffel was alive when it was built (1889), so yes. 10.

Ford's Theatre: John T. Ford was alive when it was built (1863), but he died in 1896. The theatre was named after him during his lifetime. So yes, 10.

Carnegie Hall: Named after Andrew Carnegie, who funded it. The hall opened in 1891, and Carnegie was alive until 1919. So yes, during his lifetime. 10.

Shakespeare's Globe: Shakespeare died in 1616, the original Globe was built in 1599. The reconstruction was in 1997. So named posthumously, 400 years later. So this would not fit the theme. So maybe this is a low score, like 2.

Ah! That's a key point I missed earlier. The examples were named during the person's lifetime, but the anti-examples (like Washington DC) were posthumous. So the theme could be "places named after a person during their lifetime, not a memorial or capital".

If that's the case, then:

1. Eiffel Tower: Eiffel was alive when it was built (1889, he died 1929). So yes. 10.

2. Mount Vernon: Not named after Washington, so 0.

3. Graceland: Not named after Elvis, so 0.

4. Monticello: Not named after Jefferson, so 0.

5. Chrysler Building: Named in 1930, Walter Chrysler was alive (died 1940). So yes. 10.

6. Ford's Theatre: Named during John T. Ford's lifetime (he died 1896, theatre built 1863). So yes. 10.

7. Carnegie Hall: Named during Carnegie's lifetime (opened 1891, he died 1919). 10.

8. Shakespeare's Globe: Named posthumously (400 years later). So this would be a 0 or 1, but since it's not a capital or memorial, but the timing is off, so maybe 2?

Wait, but the anti-example Jefferson City was named after Jefferson posthumously (Jefferson died in 1826, Jefferson City became capital in 1826). So maybe the theme requires the naming during the person's lifetime. Then Shakespeare's Globe would be a low score.

But the original examples include Hoover Dam, which was named during Hoover's presidency (he was president until 1933, and the dam was named in 1931). So the key is the timing.

If that's the case, then candidate 8 (Shakespeare's Globe) is a posthumous naming, so low score, maybe 1 or 2.

This changes things. Let me recalculate based on this new understanding:

So the theme is: A place named after a person during their lifetime, not a capital or memorial.

So candidates:

1. Eiffel Tower: Yes, during Eiffel's life. 10.

2. Mount Vernon: Not named after Washington, so 0.

3. Graceland: Not named after Elvis, so 0.

4. Monticello: Not named after Jefferson, so 0.

5. Chrysler Building: Named during Chrysler's life. 10.

6. Ford's Theatre: Named during Ford's life. 10.

7. Carnegie Hall: Named during Carnegie's life. 10.

8. Shakespeare's Globe: Named posthumously, so 0 or 1.

Wait, but the anti-examples include Washington DC, which was posthumous, so 0. So Shakespeare's Globe would be 0.

But the user says anti-examples can follow broader themes, so maybe there's another angle.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are named after people who are not presidents, but the anti-examples are presidents. Wait, but Hoover was a president, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the key is that the examples are named after individuals who are not associated with the place's location. Fermilab is in Illinois, but Fermi wasn't from there. Rockefeller Center is in NYC, but Rockefeller was a businessman there. Hoover Dam is on the Nevada/Arizona border, but Hoover was a president. The anti-examples are named after presidents connected to the capital (Washington DC, Jefferson City) or a memorial (Lincoln). Not sure.

Alternatively, the key is the structure type: the examples are all large-scale infrastructure or commercial/industrial sites (lab, center, dam), while the anti-examples are governmental or memorials (capital, memorial, capital). So:

1. Eiffel Tower is a monument, not exactly infrastructure. Maybe 8?

5. Chrysler Building is a commercial building, fits. 10.

7. Carnegie Hall is a cultural building, maybe 9?

But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, going back to the first analysis without considering the timing, but focusing on the structure of the name:

Examples have the surname combined with the structure type without possessive. Candidates with possessive might get lower scores.

So:

1. Eiffel Tower: Eiffel + Tower → 10.

5. Chrysler Building: Chrysler + Building → 10.

7. Carnegie Hall: Carnegie + Hall →10.

6. Ford's Theatre: possessive → maybe 8.

8. Shakespeare's Globe: possessive →8.

So this way, the scores are spread out.

Alternatively, maybe "Rockefeller Center" is a proper name, so "Rockefeller" is part of the name without possessive, so the examples don't use possessive. So candidates with possessive like Ford's and Shakespeare's would be lower.

Thus:

Ford's Theatre (6) → maybe 8, Shakespeare's Globe (8) →8.

Eiffel Tower (1) is perfect →10.

Carnegie Hall (7) →10.

So the scores would be:

1:10

2:0

3:0

4:0

5:10

6:8

7:10

8:8

But maybe the user expects more nuanced. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the key is that the examples are all named after a person who contributed to the creation or funding of the place, but not necessarily alive. For example, Fermi was a scientist, Rockefeller funded it, Hoover was the president who authorized it.

In that case:

Eiffel Tower: Eiffel designed it →10.

Chrysler Building: Chrysler's company built it →10.

Carnegie Hall: Carnegie funded it →10.

Ford's Theatre: Ford was the owner →10.

Shakespeare's Globe: Shakespeare wasn't involved in building the new one, it's a tribute → maybe 6.

So that's another angle.

Alternatively, the key is that the place's name is a direct combination of the person's surname and the structure type without any possessive or additional words. Like Fermilab (Fermi + lab), Rockefeller Center (Rockefeller + Center), Hoover Dam (Hoover + Dam).

Eiffel Tower is Eiffel + Tower →10.

Chrysler Building →Chrysler + Building →10.

Carnegie Hall → Carnegie + Hall →10.

Ford's Theatre has "Ford's" (possessive) + Theatre → so maybe 8.

Shakespeare's Globe → possessive →8.

Mount Vernon, Graceland, Monticello not named after the person →0.

Thus, the scores would be:

1:10

2:0

3:0

4:0

5:10

6:8

7:10

8:8

This seems plausible. The possessive forms reduce the score a bit.

Alternatively, maybe "Rockefeller Center" is a proper noun where the surname is part of the name, so any possessive is less direct. So Ford's Theatre and Shakespeare's Globe are less direct, hence lower scores.

Alternatively, the user might have a different angle. Since I have to make a decision, I'll go with the structure of the name: possessive vs non-possessive.

Final scores:

1. Eiffel Tower →10

2. Mount Vernon →0

3. Graceland →0

4. Monticello →0

5. Chrysler Building →10

6. Ford's Theatre →8

7. Carnegie Hall →10

8. Shakespeare's Globe →8

But let me check candidate 8 again. The original Globe Theatre wasn't named after Shakespeare, but the new one is called Shakespeare's Globe to distinguish it and honor him. So the name is more of a tribute rather than a direct naming by the person's contribution. Hence, maybe 7?

Alternatively, if it's considered a direct naming after him, then 8.

I'll assign 8.

Thus, the scores as above.
