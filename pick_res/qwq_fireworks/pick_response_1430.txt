Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples and anti-examples. The examples are Jadeite, Hematite, and Iron pyrite. The anti-examples are Turquoise, Silver, and Gold.

Starting with the examples: Jadeite is a variety of jade, a mineral. Hematite is an iron oxide mineral, commonly known for its silver color and metallic luster. Iron pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron sulfide mineral. All three are minerals, so maybe the theme is related to minerals. But let's look at the anti-examples to narrow it down.

Turquoise is also a mineral, so that complicates things because it's an anti-example. So the theme isn't just "minerals" in general. Silver and Gold are elements and also minerals, but they're metals. The examples (Jadeite, Hematite, Pyrite) are minerals but not elemental metals. Wait, but Hematite is an oxide, Pyrite a sulfide, Jadeite a silicate. Maybe the theme is non-metallic minerals or specific types?

Alternatively, looking at their uses: Jadeite is used in jewelry and carvings, Hematite for its magnetic properties and as a source of iron, Pyrite sometimes in jewelry or as a mineral specimen. Maybe they are all minerals that are not precious metals but still have some ornamental or industrial use. Turquoise is also used in jewelry, so that's why it's an anti-example. Hmm, but then why is Turquoise excluded?

Wait, perhaps the key is the chemical composition. Let's see:

- Jadeite: sodium and aluminum silicate.
- Hematite: iron(III) oxide.
- Iron Pyrite: iron disulfide.
  
All contain iron except Jadeite. Wait, Jadeite doesn't have iron. So that can't be. Alternatively, maybe they are all minerals that form in specific conditions or have certain properties. Alternatively, maybe they are all minerals that are not elements. Since Silver and Gold are elements, but the examples are compounds. Turquoise is a hydrous phosphate of copper and aluminum, so also a compound. But Turquoise is an anti-example. So that doesn't fit.

Another angle: perhaps they are all minerals that are not metals but can have a metallic luster? Hematite and Pyrite can have a metallic luster, Jadeite is more of a translucent to opaque gemstone. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, looking at the anti-examples: Turquoise is a mineral but maybe it's not considered in the same category as the examples. Let's think of another approach. The examples could be minerals that are not precious stones but are semi-precious or industrial. But Turquoise is a semi-precious stone, so that might not work.

Alternatively, maybe they are minerals that are used in specific ways. For instance, Jadeite is a gemstone, Hematite is used in industry, Pyrite as a mineral specimen. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the theme is minerals that have "ite" in their name. Let's check:

- Jadeite: ends with -ite.
- Hematite: ends with -ite.
- Iron pyrite: pyrite ends with -ite.

Turquoise ends with -quoise, so that's different. Silver and Gold don't have -ite, so that could be the theme. The anti-examples don't have the suffix "-ite", while the examples do. But let me confirm:

- Azurite (candidate 2) has -ite.
- Malachite (candidate 5) has -ite.
- Cinnabar (ends with -bar) no.
- Galena (ends with -ena) no.
- Obsidian (no), Copper (no), Cocoa beans (no), Salt (no).

But wait, the anti-example Turquoise does not end with -ite, but so do the other anti-examples. So if the theme is minerals ending with -ite, then the examples fit, and the anti-examples don't. Let's see if that holds.

The examples all end with -ite. The anti-examples (Turquoise, Silver, Gold) don't. That could be the specific theme. Then the candidates:

1. Obsidian: No, ends with -ian. So 0?
2. Azurite: Yes, ends with -ite. 10?
3. Copper: No, ends with -per. 0?
4. Cocoa beans: Not a mineral. 0.
5. Malachite: Yes, ends with -ite. 10?
6. Cinnabar: No. 0.
7. Galena: Ends with -ena. 0?
8. Salt: No. 0.

Wait, but the user said to use a scale from 0-10, not just 0 and 10. Hmm. Maybe there's more nuance. Maybe some words have -ite but are not minerals. For example, Azurite is a mineral, so that's a perfect fit. Malachite too. But maybe some candidates have the suffix but aren't minerals, but looking at the list:

Cocoa beans are not minerals. Galena is a mineral. Wait, Galena is a mineral (lead sulfide), ending with -ena, so doesn't fit. So maybe Galena would be 0. Wait, but the user said to consider the theme based on the examples, so if the theme is minerals ending with -ite, then:

Candidate 7 is Galena (no -ite, so 0). Candidate 2 Azurite (10), candidate5 Malachite (10). Candidate1 Obsidian (no, 0), candidate3 Copper (no, 0), 4 Cocoa beans (no,0), 6 Cinnabar (no,0), 8 Salt (no,0). But the user wants a nuanced score, so maybe some are partial matches?

Alternatively, maybe the theme isn't just the suffix but something else. Let me think again.

Another angle: the examples are all minerals that are not metals. Jadeite is a silicate, Hematite is an oxide, Iron Pyrite a sulfide. The anti-examples include metals (Silver, Gold) and Turquoise (a phosphate, so non-metallic). Wait, Turquoise is a mineral but not a metal, so that might not fit. So perhaps the theme is minerals that are not metals but have a certain property?

Wait, perhaps the examples are all minerals that are semi-precious or ornamental but not considered precious metals. Turquoise is a semi-precious stone, so why is it an anti-example? That doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe they are all minerals that are named after their color or some property. Jadeite is green, Hematite is red (from blood in Greek, haima), Pyrite is golden. Turquoise is blue-green, so maybe color-based names? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at their chemical composition, all examples contain iron except Jadeite. Wait, Jadeite is sodium and aluminum silicate. Hematite is iron oxide, Pyrite iron sulfide. So they are all minerals that contain iron except Jadeite. Hmm, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the theme is minerals that can be used as gemstones but are not precious. Jadeite is a gemstone, Hematite can be used in jewelry, Pyrite too. Turquoise is a gemstone, so that would make Turquoise an example, but it's an anti-example. So that can't be.

Another thought: The examples are all minerals that have a crystalline structure, whereas the anti-examples might not. But Turquoise is a mineral with a microcrystalline structure. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe they are all minerals that are not native elements. Jadeite is a silicate, Hematite an oxide, Pyrite a sulfide. So native elements are like gold, silver, copper (which is an anti-example). So the theme could be minerals that are compounds, not elements. Then Turquoise is a compound (phosphate), so still an anti-example. Hmm, Turquoise is a compound but it's an anti-example. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, the anti-examples include Turquoise, which is a compound, so the theme must exclude it for another reason. Maybe the specific theme is minerals that are silicates, oxides, or sulfides. Let's check:

- Jadeite is a silicate (sodium aluminum silicate).
- Hematite is an oxide (Fe₂O₃).
- Iron Pyrite is a sulfide (FeS₂).

Turquoise is a phosphate (CuAl₆(PO₄)₄(OH)₈·4H₂O), so a different class. So maybe the theme is minerals belonging to the silicate, oxide, or sulfide classes. Then the anti-examples include Turquoise (phosphate), Silver (native element), Gold (native element). That fits.

So the theme is minerals in the silicate, oxide, or sulfide classes. Now checking candidates:

1. Obsidian: volcanic glass, not a crystalline mineral, so maybe not. Score low, maybe 1.
2. Azurite: a carbonate mineral (Cu₃(CO₃)₂(OH)₂), so carbonate class. Not in the allowed classes (silicate, oxide, sulfide). So maybe 0 or 1.
Wait, Azurite is a carbonate, which is different from the examples. So it wouldn't fit the theme. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the theme is specifically minerals in those three classes (silicate, oxide, sulfide) and also have certain properties. Let me recheck:

Hematite is an oxide (allowed), Pyrite a sulfide (allowed), Jadeite a silicate (allowed). So the theme is minerals in those three classes. So any mineral in those classes would be a match. Then:

Candidate 2: Azurite is a carbonate → not, so 0.

Candidate 5: Malachite is a carbonate as well (Cu₂CO₃(OH)₂). So also 0.

Candidate7: Galena is a sulfide (PbS), so that's in the sulfide class → 10.

Candidate6: Cinnabar is a sulfide (HgS) → yes, so 10.

Candidate3: Copper is a native element → no → 0.

Candidate1: Obsidian is a glass, not crystalline mineral → maybe 0.

Candidate4: Cocoa beans are not minerals → 0.

Candidate8: Salt is halite, a halide (NaCl), so halide class → not in the three allowed classes → 0.

Wait, but this would mean that Galena and Cinnabar (candidates 6 and 7) would be 10. But let's see the anti-examples: Turquoise is a phosphate (so not in the three classes), Silver and Gold are native elements (so also not in the three classes). So that fits. The examples fit the three classes, the anti-examples don't. Then the candidates:

1. Obsidian (not a mineral in those classes) → 0
2. Azurite (carbonate → no) → 0
3. Copper (native → no) →0
4. Cocoa beans (non-mineral) →0
5. Malachite (carbonate → no) →0
6. Cinnabar (sulfide → yes) →10
7. Galena (sulfide → yes) →10
8. Salt (halide → no) →0

But the user wants a nuanced score from 0-10. Maybe some have partial matches. For instance, if a candidate is a mineral but in a different class, maybe 1 or 2. But according to the theme, it's either in the allowed classes or not. So 10 if yes, 0 if no. But the user said to use the full range. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is minerals that are common in certain geological settings, but that's vague.

Wait, another angle: all examples are minerals that are not gemstones but are used in other ways? No, Jadeite is a gemstone. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the examples and anti-examples again:

Examples: Jadeite, Hematite, Iron Pyrite.

Anti-examples: Turquoise, Silver, Gold.

Perhaps the theme is minerals that are not precious metals and not gemstones of a certain type? But Turquoise is a gemstone, so maybe the theme is minerals that are not precious metals but are still valuable as minerals. Not sure.

Alternatively, the theme could be minerals that have a metallic luster but are not actual metals. Hematite can have a metallic luster, Pyrite definitely does, Jadeite usually has a vitreous or pearly luster. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's think of another approach. Let me list the chemical formulas again:

Jadeite: NaAlSi₂O₆ (silicate)
Hematite: Fe₂O₃ (oxide)
Iron Pyrite: FeS₂ (sulfide)

So all are minerals composed of elements that are not precious metals. The anti-examples include Silver (Ag), Gold (Au), which are precious metals. Turquoise is a phosphate with copper, so non-precious. So maybe the theme is minerals that do not contain precious metals. Turquoise contains copper, so it's allowed, but it's an anti-example. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try another angle. The examples are all minerals that have a certain suffix in their name, like ending with -ite. Let me confirm:

Jadeite ends with -ite.

Hematite ends with -ite.

Iron pyrite has "pyrite" which ends with -ite.

Turquoise ends with -quoise.

Silver and Gold don't have -ite.

If the theme is minerals with the suffix "-ite", then the examples fit perfectly. The anti-examples don't. Then the candidates:

1. Obsidian: no → 0
2. Azurite: yes →10
3. Copper: no →0
4. Cocoa beans: no →0
5. Malachite: yes →10
6. Cinnabar: no →0 (ends with -bar)
7. Galena: ends with -ena →0
8. Salt: no →0

But the user wants a nuanced score, so maybe some are partial. For instance, maybe Azurite and Malachite are perfect matches (10), others not. But the instructions say to use the full range. Maybe some candidates have -ite but are not minerals? Wait, Azurite and Malachite are minerals. So they get 10. The others get 0. But the user's example scores had numbers like 3,7, etc. So perhaps the suffix -ite is part of the theme but there's more.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is minerals that are not native elements and have a certain structure. Wait, maybe the theme is minerals that are not precious and not metals. Then Turquoise is a non-metal but is an anti-example. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the examples are all minerals that are not gemstones but are used in other applications. Jadeite is a gemstone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: the examples are all minerals that can be confused with precious metals. Pyrite is called fool's gold, Hematite can sometimes look like silver, and Jadeite might not, but maybe in some forms. Turquoise is blue, so not confused with gold/silver. That might be a stretch, but possible.

Alternatively, the theme is minerals that are not elemental but can be used as pigments. Hematite is red pigment, Pyrite is yellow, Jadeite can be green. Turquoise is blue-green pigment. So Turquoise would fit but it's an anti-example, so that's conflicting.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should go back to the suffix -ite idea. It's the most straightforward. Even if the user wants nuanced scores, maybe some candidates have the suffix but are not minerals (so lower score?), but in the candidates, all except Cocoa beans and Salt are minerals. Wait, Cocoa beans are not minerals. So:

Candidate 2 (Azurite) is a mineral with -ite → 10

Candidate5 (Malachite) →10

Candidate7 (Galena) → no suffix →0

Candidate6 (Cinnabar) → no →0

Candidate1 (Obsidian) → no →0

Candidate3 (Copper) → no →0

Candidate4 (Cocoa beans) →0

Candidate8 (Salt) →0

But the user's examples have a perfect fit, and the anti-examples don't. The problem is that the user wants a range from 0-10. Maybe some candidates are partially matching. For example, if a mineral has a similar-sounding suffix but not exactly -ite, like -ene or -ate, but in the list, there's Galena (-ena), which is close but not. Maybe give Galena a 1 or 2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is minerals that are not elements and not precious, but that's too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the examples are all minerals that are not metals but have a metallic appearance. Hematite and Pyrite do, but Jadeite usually doesn't. So that's not it.

Wait, another angle: Jadeite, Hematite, and Pyrite are all minerals that are not gemstones but are used in other applications. But Jadeite is a gemstone, so no.

Alternatively, they are all minerals that have a Mohs hardness above a certain level. Let's see:

Jadeite: 6.5–7

Hematite: 5.5–6.5

Pyrite: 6–6.5

Turquoise: 5–6

Silver: 2.5–3

Gold: 2.5–3

So the examples have higher hardness. Turquoise is lower, so maybe the theme is minerals with Mohs hardness above 5.5? Then:

Candidate hardness:

Obsidian: 5-5.5 → maybe 5. So close to 5.5. Maybe score 5?

Azurite: 3.5-4 → lower → 0 or 1.

Malachite: 3.5 →0.

Cinnabar: 2-2.5 →0.

Galena: 2.5 →0.

Copper: 2.5–3 →0.

Cocoa beans: not a mineral →0.

Salt (halite): 2–2.5 →0.

So Obsidian would get a 5, others 0 except maybe Azurite is 1.

But this requires knowledge of hardness values which might be beyond the given info. The user might expect a different approach.

Perhaps I should proceed with the suffix -ite as the theme, even if it's a bit simplistic, because that's the most obvious pattern. Then assign scores based on that:

1. Obsidian: 0 (no -ite)
2. Azurite:10 (has -ite)
3. Copper:0
4. Cocoa beans:0
5. Malachite:10
6. Cinnabar:0
7. Galena:0 (ends with -ena)
8. Salt:0

But the user wants a range. Maybe some are partial. For example, maybe Galena is a mineral but doesn't have -ite, so 0. Azurite and Malachite are perfect. The rest get 0. But the user's examples included three 10s and three 0s. The candidates have two 10s and the rest 0. But the user might want more variation. Maybe I'm missing another aspect.

Wait, looking at the examples again: Jadeite, Hematite, Iron pyrite. All have "ite" in their names, but Iron pyrite is sometimes called pyrite. So the key is the -ite suffix.

The anti-examples Turquoise has "quoise", Silver and Gold are elements.

Thus, the theme is minerals with the suffix "-ite". So the candidates:

Azurite (2), Malachite (5) get 10. Others get 0 unless there's a partial match. Maybe some have similar endings but not exactly? Like "Cinnabar" ends with "bar", not "ite", so no. Galena ends with "ena", so no. Obsidian ends with "ian". So all others are 0 except 2 and 5.

But the user requires scores from 0-10, so maybe some get 1 or 2 if they're minerals but not with -ite, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe Obsidian is a volcanic glass, which is a mineraloid, so not a true mineral. But that's a technicality. The user might consider it a mineral. Still, it doesn't have the suffix.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is minerals that are not precious metals and have a certain property. But without more info, I'll proceed with the suffix.

Final scores:

1. Obsidian →0

2. Azurite →10

3. Copper →0

4. Cocoa beans →0

5. Malachite →10

6. Cinnabar →0

7. Galena →0

8. Salt →0

But the user wants a nuanced scale. Maybe I should consider that some candidates are minerals but don't have the suffix, so they get low scores like 1 or 2. For example, Galena is a mineral but not ending with -ite →1. Obsidian is a mineral →1. But the examples are only those with the suffix. Thus, the non-suffix minerals get 0, and the suffix ones 10. But the user's instructions say to use the full range, so perhaps I should think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is minerals that are not elements and have a certain chemical structure. For example, compounds with metal and non-metal elements. Jadeite has Na and Al with silicate. Hematite Fe and O. Pyrite Fe and S. Turquoise has Cu and Al with phosphate. So all are compounds, but Turquoise is still an anti-example. Not helpful.

Hmm. Since I might be overcomplicating, and the -ite suffix is the most straightforward, I'll proceed with that, even if it results in some 10s and 0s. But the user said not to have just 0s and 10s. Maybe some are close. For example, maybe "Azurite" is a perfect match (10), "Malachite" also 10. "Galena" is a mineral but doesn't have the suffix, so 0. "Obsidian" is a mineral but no suffix, so 0. "Cinnabar" is a mineral but ends with -bar, so maybe 1. "Salt" is a mineral (halite) but no suffix →0. "Copper" is an element →0. "Cocoa beans" are not minerals →0. "Azurite and Malachite are 10, others mostly 0 except Cinnabar as 1. That gives a range from 0-10.

Wait, Cinnabar is a mineral (HgS), so it's a sulfide. Wait, sulfide is one of the allowed classes if the theme was based on mineral classes. Earlier thought: if the theme is minerals in silicate, oxide, or sulfide classes:

- Cinnabar is a sulfide →10.

- Galena is a sulfide →10.

- Malachite is a carbonate →0.

- Azurite is a carbonate →0.

- Obsidian is not crystalline →0.

- Salt is halide →0.

- Copper is native →0.

- Cocoa beans →0.

So in this case, Cinnabar (6) and Galena (7) would be 10. Then the scores would be:

1. Obsidian:0

2. Azurite:0 (carbonate)

3. Copper:0

4. Cocoa beans:0

5. Malachite:0

6. Cinnabar:10

7. Galena:10

8. Salt:0

This gives two 10s and the rest 0, but the user wants a range. Maybe some partial scores. For instance, if a mineral is in a different class but related, like carbonate (Azurite and Malachite) → maybe 2 each. Sulfide (Cinnabar and Galena) get 10. Others 0. That uses 0,2,10.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is minerals that are not native elements. Then Copper (native) is 0, others are minerals (so 10?), but Turquoise is a mineral but anti-example. So that's not.

Alternatively, the theme is minerals that are not precious metals and have a certain hardness. If examples have hardness above 5, then:

Obsidian (5-5.5 →5)

Azurite (3.5 →1)

Malachite (3.5 →1)

Cinnabar (2 →0)

Galena (2.5 →0)

Copper (2.5 →0)

So Obsidian gets 5, others low. That uses some numbers.

But without clear data, I think the suffix is the best bet. So I'll go with that, assigning 10 to Azurite and Malachite, others 0. But to fulfill the nuanced scores, maybe:

Azurite and Malachite are 10.

Galena and Cinnabar are minerals but not with -ite →0.

Obsidian is a mineral without the suffix →1.

Cocoa beans and Salt are non-minerals →0.

Copper is an element →0.

So:

1. Obsidian:1

2. Azurite:10

3. Copper:0

4. Cocoa beans:0

5. Malachite:10

6. Cinnabar:0

7. Galena:0

8. Salt:0

This uses 0,1,10. Better, but still limited. Maybe Obsidian gets 2, others 0 except the two 10s. Alternatively, maybe some candidates are part of the same group but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is minerals that are not precious and have a certain color. For example, Jadeite is green, Hematite red, Pyrite gold. So colors might not be the theme.

Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the suffix -ite, giving 10 to Azurite and Malachite, 0 to others, and assign 1 to Obsidian as a mineral but no suffix. That uses 0,1,10. Maybe the user will accept that.
