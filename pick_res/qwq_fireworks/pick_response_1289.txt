Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the specific theme from the given examples and then figure out why the anti-examples don't fit. The examples are a flower carpet for a religious procession in Belgium, a rangoli for Diwali, and a Tibetan sand mandala. These all seem to be temporary, ephemeral artworks created for a specific religious or cultural ceremony. They’re made from natural or biodegradable materials (flowers, rice flour, petals, sand) and are part of a ritual or celebration. They’re also transient, meant to be created and then dismantled or allowed to dissipate as part of the ceremony's symbolism.

Now, the anti-examples are a carved pumpkin for Halloween, painted Easter eggs, and carved wooden masks used in rituals. These are misleading because they are part of rituals or celebrations but aren't temporary in the same way. Pumpkins decompose, but Halloween is a different cultural context. Easter eggs might be temporary, but the painting is more of a decoration than a ceremonial centerpiece. The masks are used in rituals but are likely kept and reused, so not ephemeral.

So the key elements of the specific theme are:
1. Made for a religious or major cultural ceremony.
2. Created from natural, transient materials.
3. The artwork is part of the仪式 itself and is temporary (meant to be dismantled or left to disperse).
4. The form is a flat or ground-level arrangement (carpet, rangoli, mandala on the floor).

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. **Pottery vase with intricate patterns**: Vases are objects meant to hold flowers, not temporary. They’re crafted items, not created specifically for a one-time ceremony. Unless it's broken afterward, but that's not typical. So probably low score.

2. **Mosaic made of tiles on a floor**: Mosaics are permanent, built into structures. Even if in a religious site, they’re meant to last, not temporary. So maybe low.

3. **Carved stone monument in a cemetery**: Stone is permanent, monuments are meant to last. Not ephemeral. Low score.

4. **Sculpture carved from marble**: Again, permanent art. Unless it's a temporary installation, but marble is durable. Low.

5. **Henna tattoo for a wedding**: Henna is temporary, fades over time. Applied for a specific ceremony (wedding), made from natural materials (henna paste). This fits more closely. Maybe mid to high score.

6. **Carved ivory figurine**: Ivory is a durable material, and figurines are typically kept. Unless it's part of a ritual where it's destroyed, but that's not common. So lower score.

7. **Woven tapestry in a museum**: Tapestry is a durable textile, meant to be preserved. Unless displayed temporarily for a ceremony, but stored otherwise. Probably low.

8. **Stained glass window in a cathedral**: Permanent fixture, part of the building's architecture. Not temporary. Low.

Wait, but let me check each again carefully.

Candidate 5: Henna is applied to the body for a wedding. It’s temporary (lasts weeks), made from natural materials, and part of a specific ceremony. This seems to align well with the examples. So maybe a 7 or 8? The examples are all large-scale (carpet, rangoli, mandala), but henna is personal. However, the key points are the temporary, natural, ritual use. So maybe 7?

Candidate 8: Stained glass is part of a cathedral, permanent, not made for a specific event but a lasting part of the building. So 0 or 1.

Candidate 2: Mosaic tiles on a floor—could be part of a temple's decoration but not temporary. Unless it's a temporary mosaic like some street art, but the example specifies tiles, which are permanent. So 2?

Candidate 1: Pottery vase is an object, not a ground-level temporary arrangement. 1 or 2.

Candidate 3: Stone monument is permanent. 0 or 1.

Candidate 4: Marble sculpture is permanent. 0 or 1.

Candidate 6: Ivory is durable, so 1 or 2.

Candidate 7: Tapestry is woven and displayed, but in a museum, so not part of an active ceremony. Unless it's displayed during a ceremony but stored otherwise. Maybe 3?

Hmm, need to ensure the scores are spread out. Let me assign:

1. Pottery vase: 1 (since it's an object not ephemeral, not part of a ceremony's core)
2. Tile mosaic: 2 (permanent, not temporary)
3. Stone monument: 1 (permanent)
4. Marble sculpture: 0 (durable and not temporary)
5. Henna: 8 (temporary, natural, ritual use, close to the examples)
6. Ivory: 2 (durable, not ephemeral)
7. Tapestry: 3 (durable, but maybe displayed during a ceremony? Not sure. Maybe 3)
8. Stained glass: 1 (permanent, not temporary)

Wait, maybe 5 should be 7 or 8. Let me think again. The henna is applied for a wedding, which is a major cultural event. It's temporary, made from natural materials (henna is plant-based), and part of the ceremony. The examples are all large-scale floor/ground arrangements, but the key is the transient nature and ritual use. So maybe 8? But the examples are more communal, while henna is personal. So maybe 7?

Alternatively, maybe 8 is too high. Let's see. The rangoli and flower carpet are community-made, large, and part of a procession or festival. The sand mandala is also a communal, temporary ritual. The henna is personal but still fits the temporary, natural, ritual criteria. So 7 or 8. Maybe 7.

Others:

Candidate 2: Mosaic tiles are permanent. Unless it's a temporary installation, but the example says "made of tiles on a floor"—tiles are permanent. So 2.

Candidate 7: Woven tapestry in a museum—probably stored, not part of a current ceremony. 3?

Alternatively, maybe 4? Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think of each candidate's alignment:

- Must be: temporary, made for a specific religious/cultural ceremony, using natural materials, and part of the event itself (not a permanent object).

Candidate 5 (henna) fits all except maybe the scale (personal vs communal), but still qualifies. So 8.

Candidate 8 (stained glass): permanent, so 0.

Candidate 7: tapestry in a museum—stored, so not part of an active ceremony. 1.

Wait, maybe the tapestry could be displayed during a ceremony but stored otherwise. But the description says "displayed in a museum"—so permanent display, so not temporary. So 1.

Candidate 6 (ivory figurine): ivory is a durable material, so even if used in a ritual, it's not temporary. So 1.

Candidate 4 (marble sculpture): 0.

Candidate 3 (stone monument): 0.

Candidate 1 (pottery vase): 1.

Candidate 2 (mosaic): 2.

So final scores:

1. 1

2. 2

3. 0

4. 0

5. 8

6. 1

7. 1

8. 0

Wait but need to check if I'm missing nuances. Let me recheck each candidate again.

Candidate 2: Mosaic made of tiles on a floor. If it's part of a temple floor, like a religious site's decoration, but permanent. Doesn't fit the ephemeral aspect. So 2.

Candidate 3: Carved stone monument in a cemetery. Permanent, so 0.

Candidate 4: Marble sculpture: same, 0.

Candidate 5: Henna: yes, 8.

Candidate 6: Ivory: 1.

Candidate 7: Tapestry displayed in a museum: 1.

Candidate 8: stained glass: 0.

Wait but maybe the tapestry could be part of a ceremony, like displayed during a festival but stored otherwise. But the candidate says "displayed in a museum"—so it's a permanent display. So 1.

Hmm. I think that's the way to go. Let's assign the scores as per this.
