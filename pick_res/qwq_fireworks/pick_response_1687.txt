Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the three examples share. The examples given are Lion's Head Peak, South Africa; Wolf Mountain, Utah; and Tiger Hill, India. 

Looking at these names, they all include the names of animals—lion, wolf, and tiger—combined with geographical features like Peak, Mountain, and Hill. So the specific theme here seems to be geographical locations (like peaks, mountains, hills) named after large or predatory animals.

Now, the anti-examples are Rocky Mountains, Cougar Springs, and Grizzly Peak. Let's see why they don't fit the specific theme. 

Rocky Mountains is a mountain range named after a geological feature ("Rocky") rather than an animal. Cougar Springs uses "Cougar," which is an animal, but "Springs" might not be a major geographical feature in the same vein as peaks or mountains. Grizzly Peak includes an animal (Grizzly bear) and a geographical feature (Peak), so why is it an anti-example? Maybe because Grizzly Peak is a well-known place (like in Berkeley, CA), but perhaps the original theme is more about non-English animals? Wait, no, Grizzly is an English name. Alternatively, maybe the anti-examples are part of a broader category, like including "springs" or "rivers" which are not peaks, mountains, or hills. The key is that the anti-examples might fit a broader theme but not the specific one. The specific theme requires both an animal (preferably a large predator) and a geographical feature like peak, mountain, hill. 

Looking at Grizzly Peak: it does have an animal and a peak, so why is it an anti-example? Maybe because the original examples are all from different countries (South Africa, Utah, India) but Grizzly Peak is in the US, same as Wolf Mountain. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the animal names in the examples are all big cats (lion, tiger, wolf) but Grizzly is a bear. Maybe the theme is big cats? Wait, Wolf isn't a big cat. So that's not it. Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the animal is part of the name of the feature, like "Lion's Head" where the head is a part of the animal, but "Wolf Mountain" is just the animal plus the feature. Maybe the exact structure is the animal's name followed by a geographical term, but the anti-examples might have the animal in a different position or a different structure. 

Alternatively, looking at Cougar Springs: "Cougar" is an animal, but "Springs" is a different feature. The original examples are all "Animal + Feature" where the feature is a prominent landform (peak, mountain, hill). So Cougar Springs uses a less prominent feature, so it's part of a broader theme but not the specific one. Similarly, Grizzly Peak is a peak, so maybe it's allowed? Wait, but Grizzly Peak is listed as an anti-example. So maybe there's another factor. 

Alternatively, perhaps the animal names in the examples are all from the Felidae family (lion, tiger, wolf?) Wait, wolf isn't a feline. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the animal is a predator. All three examples are predators. Cougar is also a predator, so that might not be it. Alternatively, maybe the animal names are from different languages? Not sure. 

Wait, perhaps the key is that the examples all have the animal name followed by a geographical term (Peak, Mountain, Hill) without any other words in between. Let's check the anti-examples:

Rocky Mountains: "Rocky" is an adjective, not an animal. So that's out.

Cougar Springs: "Cougar" is the animal, but "Springs" is the feature. So that's similar structure, but maybe "Springs" is less common as a major landform? Or maybe "Springs" is part of a town or a smaller feature, whereas the examples are more notable peaks/mountains.

Grizzly Peak: "Grizzly" is the animal, "Peak" is the feature. So this should fit, but it's an anti-example. So perhaps the issue is that Grizzly Peak is a proper name that's also a common term (like Grizzly Peak is a common name for a peak with a grizzly?), but maybe the original examples are more specific to countries or regions. Alternatively, maybe the animal has to be a specific species, like "Lion's Head" refers to a specific lion-shaped head, but that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the geographical feature's name includes the animal's name as a possessive, like "Lion's Head", but Wolf Mountain and Tiger Hill don't use the possessive. Wait, "Lion's Head" has an apostrophe S, but the others don't. So maybe that's part of it? But the other examples don't have that. So that might not be the case.

Hmm. Let's try another angle. The examples are all named after animals, with the animal's name directly followed by a geographical term (Peak, Mountain, Hill). The anti-examples include Rocky Mountains (no animal), Cougar Springs (Springs instead of a major landform), and Grizzly Peak. Wait, Grizzly Peak is an animal plus a peak, so why is it an anti-example? Maybe because Grizzly is a bear, and the examples are all big cats or wolves? But wolf isn't a big cat. Alternatively, perhaps the examples are all from specific countries, but the anti-examples are in different regions? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the geographical feature is a specific type: peaks, mountains, hills. The anti-examples include a river (Snake River?), no, Snake River is a candidate, but the anti-example is Cougar Springs (springs) and Rocky Mountains (a mountain range, which is a broader term than a single mountain). So perhaps the specific theme is that it's a singular geographical feature (like a single mountain, peak, hill) named after an animal, whereas the anti-examples are either part of a larger range (Rocky Mountains) or a different type (springs). 

So, applying this to the candidates:

1. Wolf Creek Pass: Wolf is the animal, but "Creek Pass" is a pass, which is a type of geographical feature. So maybe this is a good fit? But passes are less common in the examples. The examples had peaks, mountains, hills. Passes might be a bit different, so maybe a lower score.

2. Coyote Valley: Coyote is an animal, Valley is a geographical feature. So that fits the structure. So maybe a good score.

3. Hawk Ridge: Hawk is a bird, but maybe considered a predator. Ridge is a geographical feature. So that fits.

4. Bear Butte, South Dakota: Bear is the animal, Butte is a geographical term. Butte is a hill with a specific shape. So this fits the theme.

5. Bear Lake: Lake is a body of water. The examples were peaks/mountains/hills. So maybe not a perfect fit. So lower score.

6. Fox River: Fox is the animal, River is a water feature. Again, not a landform like the examples. Lower score.

7. Shark Bay: Shark is the animal, Bay is a water feature. Again, not a landform. Lower score.

8. Snake River: Snake is the animal, River is a water feature. So same as above.

Now, the anti-examples included Cougar Springs (springs) and Grizzly Peak (peak). Wait, Grizzly Peak is a peak, so why is it an anti-example? Maybe because the original examples are from different regions? Or perhaps the animal has to be a specific type. Alternatively, maybe the examples are all from non-US locations except Wolf Mountain, Utah. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the theme requires the animal to be a large predator, and Grizzly is a bear but acceptable, but the anti-examples are there for another reason. 

Alternatively, perhaps the specific theme requires the animal to be a big cat or similar, but that doesn't fit Wolf. Hmm. Alternatively, the theme is that the animal is part of the name of the feature, and the geographical term is a hill, mountain, or peak. So any animal plus those terms would fit. But then Grizzly Peak would fit, so why is it an anti-example? 

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: The anti-examples do not match the specific theme but can match a broader theme. So Grizzly Peak might fit a broader theme (animal + any geographical feature) but not the specific one. The specific theme might require the animal to be a specific type, like a big cat or a wolf, but then the examples include a tiger (big cat), lion (big cat), and wolf. So maybe the specific theme is big cats plus wolf? That's inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the specific theme is that the animal is a land predator, excluding water animals. But Shark Bay has a shark, which is a water predator. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all from specific countries, but the anti-examples are from other regions. Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the animal is part of the name of the geographical feature without any other words in between. For example, "Lion's Head" has an apostrophe S, but Wolf Mountain and Tiger Hill don't. Maybe the structure is just [Animal] [Geographical Term] without possessive. Then Grizzly Peak would fit, so why is it an anti-example? 

Alternatively, perhaps the specific theme is that the animal is a large predator, and the geographical feature is a prominent peak or mountain. So "Grizzly Peak" might be acceptable, but it's an anti-example. That's confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples all have the animal name as the primary name, followed by the geographical term, but in Grizzly Peak, "Grizzly" is an adjective modifying "Peak"? No, it's a proper noun. 

Hmm. Maybe the key is that the examples are all in specific countries: South Africa, Utah (US), India. The anti-examples include Rocky Mountains (US), Cougar Springs (maybe US?), Grizzly Peak (US). So maybe the specific theme requires the animal to be indigenous to that region? For example, Lion in South Africa, Wolf in Utah, Tiger in India. But Grizzly is also in the US. Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is that the animal's name is followed by a geographical feature, but the anti-examples include a mountain range (Rocky Mountains) which is plural, whereas the examples are singular. So the specific theme is singular geographical features named after animals, not part of a larger range. So Grizzly Peak is a single peak, so it should fit, but it's an anti-example. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples have the animal name as the main identifier, while the anti-examples have the geographical feature as the main one. Not sure. 

Given the confusion with Grizzly Peak being an anti-example despite fitting the structure, perhaps the specific theme is that the animal is a big cat (lion, tiger) or wolf, but not bears (grizzly). But then the example includes Wolf Mountain, so wolf is okay. So maybe the theme excludes bears. Thus, Bear Butte would be an anti-example, but it's a candidate here. Wait, the candidates include Bear Butte, which would then be a low score if the theme excludes bears. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is that the animal is a feline (lion, tiger) or wolf, but not canines like coyote. Wait, but Wolf is a canine. So that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the geographical feature has to be a "Head", "Mountain", or "Hill", but not "Butte", "Valley", etc. But the examples include those terms. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the animal's name is the first part, and the second part is a specific type of landform (peak, mountain, hill). So any animal plus those terms would qualify, but the anti-examples use different terms (springs, river, etc). 

So proceeding with that assumption:

For each candidate:

1. Wolf Creek Pass: Wolf (animal) + Pass (geographical feature). Pass is a type of landform (like a gap between mountains). Since the examples included peaks, mountains, hills, maybe pass is acceptable. So maybe a 7 or 8? But maybe pass is less common, so 6?

2. Coyote Valley: Coyote (animal) + Valley. Valley is a geographical feature. So fits the structure. 8?

3. Hawk Ridge: Hawk (bird, considered a predator) + Ridge. Ridge is a landform. 7?

4. Bear Butte: Bear + Butte (a butte is a hill with a steep side). So fits. 9?

5. Bear Lake: Bear + Lake (water, not landform). 2?

6. Fox River: Fox + River. Water, so 1?

7. Shark Bay: Shark (water animal) + Bay (water). 0?

8. Snake River: Snake (reptile) + River. 1?

Wait, but the examples include animals that are land-based (lion, wolf, tiger). So maybe water-based animals (shark, snake) are excluded. Thus, Shark Bay and Snake River would be 0. 

But what about the anti-example Grizzly Peak, which is a bear (land animal) + peak. Since Grizzly is a bear, perhaps the original examples exclude bears. The examples have lion, tiger (both big cats), and wolf. So maybe the theme is big cats plus wolf, excluding bears. Thus, Bear Butte would be an anti-example. But the candidate Bear Butte is part of the candidates, so it would score lower. 

Wait, the original examples are Lion's Head (lion), Wolf Mountain (wolf), Tiger Hill (tiger). So the animals are lion, wolf, tiger. So the theme might be that the animal is a large predator (including wolves and big cats), but excludes bears. Therefore, Bear Butte (bear) would not fit, scoring low. 

So revising the scores:

1. Wolf Creek Pass: Wolf is acceptable. Pass is a landform. So maybe 8.

2. Coyote Valley: Coyote is a canine, but not in the examples. The examples have wolf (a canine), so maybe coyote is okay. 7?

3. Hawk Ridge: Hawk is a bird of prey, which is a predator. 8?

4. Bear Butte: Bear is excluded, so 3?

5. Bear Lake: Bear again, and lake. 1?

6. Fox River: Fox (small predator?) but river. 2?

7. Shark Bay: Water animal + water feature. 0.

8. Snake River: Reptile + water. 0.

But the anti-example Grizzly Peak is an animal (bear) plus peak. Since Grizzly is a bear, it's excluded, hence the anti-example. So Bear Butte would be similar and thus low. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme requires the animal to be a land predator, so sharks and snakes (water/reptiles) are excluded, but bears are okay as land animals. Then Bear Butte would be acceptable. Hmm, conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the examples include "Tiger Hill" (tiger is a big cat), "Wolf Mountain" (wolf), "Lion's Head" (lion). All are large, charismatic megafauna. Coyote is smaller, so maybe less likely. 

Alternatively, the key is that the animal's name is a single word without modifiers. For example, "Wolf" versus "Grizzly" (which is an adjective modifying "Bear"). Wait, Grizzly is a type of bear. So "Grizzly Peak" is the animal (Grizzly bear) plus peak, so maybe that's acceptable. But it's an anti-example, so perhaps the theme requires the animal's common name without a modifier. So "Grizzly" is a type of bear, so maybe the theme wants just "Bear" as the animal. Hence, "Bear Butte" is okay, but "Grizzly Peak" uses a specific type, making it an anti-example. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should proceed with the initial assumption that the theme is [Animal] + [Landform (peak, mountain, hill)], excluding water features and broader terms like ranges. 

Thus, the scores would be:

1. Wolf Creek Pass: Pass is a landform. Wolf is an animal. 8

2. Coyote Valley: Valley is a landform. Coyote is an animal. 7

3. Hawk Ridge: Ridge is landform. Hawk is a bird predator. 8

4. Bear Butte: Butte is landform. Bear is animal. 9 (since it fits structure)

5. Bear Lake: Lake is water. 1

6. Fox River: River is water. 1

7. Shark Bay: Bay is water. 0

8. Snake River: River. 0

But Grizzly Peak is an anti-example, which fits the structure (animal + peak), so why is it excluded? Maybe because "Grizzly" is an adjective? Or perhaps the animal must be a big cat or wolf, excluding bears. If so, then Bear Butte would be excluded, scoring lower. 

If the theme excludes bears, then Bear Butte would get a 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples have the animal's name as the main noun, and Grizzly is an adjective. So "Grizzly Peak" is "Peak of the Grizzly", whereas "Wolf Mountain" is "Mountain of the Wolf". So the structure is [Animal] [Landform], but Grizzly is a type of bear, so it's [Type of Bear] [Landform], making it not fit the exact theme. Thus, Bear Butte is "Bear Butte" which is okay, but "Grizzly Peak" is not. 

In that case, Bear Butte would be acceptable, so score 9. 

Proceeding with that, the scores would be as above. But I need to ensure that the anti-examples aren't scored high. Since Grizzly Peak is an anti-example, which would have been 8 or 9 under the initial assumption, but it's not, so there must be another rule. 

Alternatively, perhaps the geographical feature must be singular and a specific landmark, not part of a larger range. Rocky Mountains is a range, so excluded. Cougar Springs might be a place name but not a major landmark. Grizzly Peak might be a common name but not as notable as the examples. 

Alternatively, the examples are all proper nouns where the animal's name is the first part, and the second is a geographical term, without any other words. So "Wolf Creek Pass" has "Creek Pass", which is two words, so it's Wolf + Creek Pass, which might not fit. Whereas "Wolf Mountain" is one animal and one term. 

Ah! That's a good point. The examples are all "[Animal] [Single Landform Term]". Wolf Creek Pass has "Creek Pass" as two words, making it not fit the exact structure of the examples which are all two words: "Lion's Head Peak" (wait, actually Lion's Head Peak is three words, but maybe "Lion's Head" is the feature's name, followed by "Peak". Hmm, the examples are:

Lion's Head Peak, South Africa – the main name is Lion's Head, which is a peak.

Wolf Mountain, Utah – Wolf Mountain is the name, a mountain.

Tiger Hill, India – Tiger Hill is the name, a hill.

So the structure is "[Animal] [Landform]" as the primary name. 

Therefore, Wolf Creek Pass is "Wolf" plus "Creek Pass", which is two words for the landform, so it doesn't fit the two-word structure. Thus, it's a weaker match, maybe a 5.

Similarly, Coyote Valley is two words: Coyote Valley, so that fits. 8.

Hawk Ridge: two words. 8.

Bear Butte: two words. 9.

Bear Lake: two words, but lake is water. 2.

Fox River: two words, but river. 1.

Shark Bay: two words, but bay. 0.

Snake River: two words, river. 0.

Grizzly Peak would be two words, but since it's an anti-example, perhaps there's another rule. Maybe the animal must be a big cat or wolf, excluding bears. So Bear Butte would be excluded, scoring lower. 

If the examples are Lion (big cat), Wolf (canine), Tiger (big cat), then the theme is big cats or wolf. So Bear is excluded. Thus, Bear Butte would score lower, say 4.

Coyote is a canine, like wolf, so maybe acceptable. So Coyote Valley would be 7.

Hawk is a bird of prey, acceptable. 8.

So adjusting:

1. Wolf Creek Pass: structure is three words (Wolf + Creek Pass), so 5.

2. Coyote Valley: two words, canine, 7.

3. Hawk Ridge: two words, predator bird, 8.

4. Bear Butte: excluded due to bear, 4.

5. Bear Lake: excluded animal and water, 1.

6. Fox River: water, 1.

7. Shark Bay: water, 0.

8. Snake River: water, 0.

This seems plausible. So final scores:

1. Wolf Creek Pass: 5

2. Coyote Valley:7

3. Hawk Ridge:8

4. Bear Butte:4

5. Bear Lake:1

6. Fox River:1

7. Shark Bay:0

8. Snake River:0

But let me check if there's another angle. The anti-example Cougar Springs has "Cougar" (big cat) but "Springs" (water). So even though Cougar is a big cat, the feature isn't a landform, so it's excluded. Thus, the key is the landform must be a peak/mountain/hill. So any animal plus a non-landform feature (lake, river, bay, springs) scores low. 

So the scores as above. Let's confirm:

Wolf Creek Pass: "Creek Pass" is a pass (landform), so maybe it's acceptable. Then why is the structure three words an issue? Maybe the examples have the animal as the first word and the landform as the second. So "Lion's Head Peak" is a bit different, but perhaps the core is the animal + landform in the name. So "Wolf Creek Pass" includes the animal "Wolf" and the landform "Pass", so maybe it's acceptable, scoring 7.

Alternatively, if the landform must be a single word, then "Creek Pass" is two words, so it's worse. 

Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the first set of scores.
