Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the given examples and anti-examples. 

The examples are:
1. A Yurt on a wheeled frame pulled by oxen across the steppes.
2. A Conestoga wagon used by North American settlers.
3. A small covered wagon for two people, pulled by a horse, used for nomadic trading.

The anti-examples are:
1. RV
2. Covered wagon pulled by a tractor
3. Mobile home

So, the common theme in the examples seems to be nomadic or migratory transportation that's animal-drawn, specifically pulled by large animals like oxen or horses. These are traditional, land-based, and used for living/moving goods over long distances on land. The anti-examples are modern, engine-powered (tractor, RV, mobile home on wheels but not animal-pulled), so they break the specific theme but fit a broader category of mobile living or transport.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. **Houseboat**: This is a boat used as a home, floating. The examples are land-based, pulled by animals. So it's mobile but not animal-drawn and on water. Doesn't fit the specific theme. Maybe a 1 or 2.

2. **Cruise ship**: Definitely not related. It's a large ship for tourism, not nomadic living or pulled by animals. 0?

3. **Horse-drawn carriage**: This is animal-drawn, but is it for nomadic living or long-distance travel? A carriage is more for transport, not living. The examples include wagons used for living/migrating. Maybe a 4 or 5? But not as much as the Vardo.

4. **Ship**: Similar to cruise ship, but even more general. Not animal-drawn, so 0.

5. **House on wheels (not pulled by animals)**: The key here is "not pulled by animals". The examples all use animal power. So even though it's mobile, the lack of animal power drops it. Maybe a 2. But if "house on wheels" is like a modern trailer, then it's closer to an anti-example (mobile home) but not exactly. Maybe 1.

6. **Airplane**: Not land-based, not animal-drawn. 0.

7. **Train car**: Powered by engine, not animals. So 0 or 1. But train cars are part of a system, not for nomadic living. 0.

8. **Vardo (Romani people's wagon)**: vardos are traditional wagons used by Romani for nomadic life, pulled by horses. This matches exactly the theme. So 10.

Wait, but let me check again. The examples include yurts on wheeled frames (which are temporary homes), Conestoga wagons (settlers moving), and small trading wagons. The Vardo is a classic example of a nomadic wagon, so that's a 10. 

Now, rechecking the others:

Horse-drawn carriage: maybe used for transport but not necessarily for nomadic living. So maybe a 3 or 4. The examples all have a living/trading purpose. A carriage is more for transport, so lower.

Houseboat: maybe 1, since it's a home but not animal-drawn or land-based.

Train car: 0. Airplane 0. Ship 0. RV is an anti-example, so the house on wheels (if it's like an RV) would be a 0-2, but the candidate says "not pulled by animals". So maybe 2, since it's mobile but lacks the animal power and traditional aspect.

Cruise ship: 0. 

So the scores:

1. Houseboat: 1
2. Cruise ship: 0
3. Horse-drawn carriage: 4 (since it's animal-drawn but not for living/migrating)
4. Ship: 0
5. House on wheels (non-animal): 2
6. Airplane: 0
7. Train car: 0
8. Vardo: 10

Wait, but maybe the horse-drawn carriage could be a 5? The Conestoga and the others are for living/migrating, while a carriage is for transport. Maybe a 3.

Alternatively, the Vardo is a perfect 10. The others need to be scaled accordingly. Let me adjust:

Houseboat (1), Cruise (0), Horse carriage (3), Ship (0), House on wheels (2), Airplane (0), Train (0), Vardo (10).

But maybe the covered wagon pulled by a tractor is an anti-example. So a horse-drawn carriage is closer but not exactly. Maybe 4? Since it's animal-drawn but not a living wagon. The examples all have the purpose of nomadic living or trading. The carriage's purpose is different, so lower.

Alternatively, maybe the small covered wagon for two people is similar to a carriage but used for trading. So perhaps the horse-drawn carriage is a 5? Hmm.

Alternatively, the Vardo is a 10, the others are lower. Let me see the scale. The user wants scores from 0-10, nuanced. Let me think again:

The key elements are: 
- Wheeled
- Animal-pulled (oxen, horses)
- Used for nomadic purposes (living, migration, trading)
- Traditional/ historical context (not modern engine-powered)

So:

1. Houseboat: wheeled? No. Not animal-pulled. Not on land. So 0 or 1.

2. Cruise ship: no. 0.

3. Horse-drawn carriage: animal-pulled, wheeled, but not for nomadic living. Maybe 3-4. If the carriage is used for daily transport but not as a home, then lower. So 3.

4. Ship: 0.

5. House on wheels (non-animal): lacks animal power. So 1-2. Since it's a house on wheels but not pulled by animals, maybe 2.

6. Airplane: 0.

7. Train car: 0.

8. Vardo: 10.

So the scores would be:

1. 1

2. 0

3. 3

4. 0

5. 2

6. 0

7. 0

8. 10

But maybe the house on wheels (number 5) is a 1, since it's a mobile home but not animal-pulled. The anti-examples include mobile home, so it's similar. So 1.

Alternatively, maybe the houseboat is a 1, and others are as above.

So final scores as per that:

1:1, 2:0, 3:3, 4:0, 5:1, 6:0, 7:0, 8:10.

Wait but the user wants the full range. Let me check again. Maybe the horse-drawn carriage is a 4? Because it's animal-drawn and wheeled, but not for nomadic living. So 4? 

Alternatively, the Conestoga wagon is a living wagon, so the carriage isn't. So maybe 2 or 3.

Alternatively, the small wagon for two is a 7 or 8 if it were a candidate. But the Vardo is the perfect example. So the horse-drawn carriage might be a 3.

Yes, I think that's the way to go. So:

<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>0</score>
<number>3</number><score>3</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>1</score>
<number>6</score>0</score>
<number>7</number><score>0</score>
