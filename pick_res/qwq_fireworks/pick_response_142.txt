Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided examples and anti-examples to define a specific theme. The examples are military outposts in frontier regions turning into towns, post-WWII refugee camps becoming permanent, and mining towns with temporary housing becoming permanent. The anti-examples are shanty towns, traveling circuses, and RVs. 

First, I need to identify the specific theme from the examples. The common thread seems to be settlements that started as temporary or functional structures (military, refugee, mining) and evolved into permanent towns or cities. The key elements are: 1) started as a specific, temporary purpose, 2) transitioned into a settled community, and 3) became permanent.

Now, looking at the anti-examples: shanty towns are unplanned, but they didn't start as a specific temporary function. They're more about lack of planning. Traveling circuses and RVs are mobile and don't settle down. So the anti-examples don't have that transition from a specific temporary function to a permanent settlement.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. **Ghost town after gold rush**: Started as a mining town, but it was abandoned. So it didn't evolve into a permanent settlement. It went the other way. So maybe a 0 or low score. But wait, the theme is about evolving into towns. Since it was a town that became abandoned, maybe it partially matches the initial part but failed to transition. Hmm. Maybe a 2? Because it started as a mining town (like example 3) but didn't stay, so it's an incomplete example.

2. **Research station in Antarctica**: These are temporary bases, but do they become permanent communities? Some are seasonal, but some like McMurdo are permanent. However, are they evolving into towns? They are scientific, not settlements. People don't live there permanently as a community. So maybe a 4? It's a functional outpost but not transitioning into a town with residents.

3. **Labor camps for construction projects that became settlements**: This directly mirrors the mining towns and refugee camps. The labor camps were temporary for a project but then became established. This is a strong match. Probably a 9 or 10. Wait, the examples include refugee camps and mining towns. So this is exactly the same pattern. So 10?

Wait, but the user says the anti-examples are not exact matches but related. The labor camps here are exactly the theme. So 10? Let me check again. The third example was mining towns with temporary housing that transitioned into permanent. So labor camps for dams or railroads that became towns would be a perfect match. So 10.

4. **Seasonal ski resort**: It's a seasonal place, but does it transition into a year-round town? Some ski resorts have year-round activities but were built as seasonal. However, the key is whether it started as a temporary structure and became permanent. If it was built as a resort for winter, but now has permanent residents, maybe. But many are just seasonal without evolving into a town. So maybe a 5? Not sure. Maybe a 3? Because it's seasonal but not necessarily transitioning into a permanent settlement beyond tourism.

5. **Tent for camping**: A single tent is too small and temporary. Not a settlement. So 0 or 1. Since it's an individual use, not a community. 0?

6. **Cruise ship**: A ship isn't a settlement. It moves, people don't settle there. Anti-example like RV, so 0.

7. **Oil rig**: Similar to research stations. Temporary structure for work, but doesn't become a town. So maybe 2? Unless there's a settlement around it. But oil rigs themselves are not settlements. 1?

8. **Nomadic yurt**: Like the traveling circus and RVs. Mobile, not settling down. So 0.

Wait, but let me re-examine each candidate again carefully.

Candidate 1: Ghost town after gold rush. The mining town started as a temporary settlement (mining) and became a town, but then abandoned. The theme requires evolving into a settled town, so the fact that it was abandoned means it didn't transition into a permanent community. So it's an example that started but didn't complete the transition. So maybe a low score, like 2.

Candidate 2: Research station in Antarctica. Some stations are permanent, but they are for research, not as a town. The population is temporary workers, not a settled community. So maybe 3? Because it's a functional outpost but not evolving into a town with permanent residents.

Candidate 3: Labor camps becoming settlements. Perfect match, so 10.

Candidate 4: Seasonal ski resort. If it's a resort that started as seasonal but now has permanent residents and services beyond just the resort, maybe it's a 6? But if it's still seasonal without transitioning, then lower. The description says "seasonal ski resort" but doesn't specify if it evolved. The candidate says "like dams or railroads, that later became established settlements". The ski resort isn't mentioned to have done that. Wait, the candidate is "seasonal ski resort"—so it's a resort that's seasonal, but does it transition? The question is whether the candidate itself is an example of the theme. Since the candidate is just the seasonal resort, not one that became a town, so maybe a low score. Like 2 or 3? Hmm.

Candidate 5: Tent for camping—definitely 0.

Candidate 6: Cruise ship—0.

Candidate 7: Oil rig—1 or 2.

Candidate 8: Nomadic yurt—0.

Wait, maybe for candidate 4: if the seasonal ski resort is a place that started as seasonal and then became a year-round town, but the candidate is just the seasonal one. The wording is ambiguous. The examples need to have transitioned. The candidate is "a seasonal ski resort"—so it's still seasonal, so no transition. So maybe 1.

Wait, but the anti-examples include RVs, which are mobile. So the key is starting as a functional outpost (military, mining, refugee) and evolving. The ski resort is a business, not a functional outpost for a specific purpose like labor or military. So maybe it's a 2?

Hmm. Let me think again. The theme is specifically about outposts (military, refugee, mining) that evolved. The labor camps (candidate 3) are exactly that. Others need to fit that pattern.

Candidate 2: Research station. Maybe similar to military outpost but for science. But they don't become towns. So maybe a 4?

Candidate 7: Oil rig. Maybe similar to mining? But oil rigs are temporary, and the settlements around them (like in Texas) could be, but the rig itself isn't. So maybe 3?

Wait, perhaps I need to be more precise. The theme requires that the original purpose was temporary, but then became a permanent community. The key is the transition from temporary to permanent.

Candidate 3 is a direct hit (labor camps to towns) so 10.

Candidate 2: Research stations are permanent, but they are not communities. They are work sites. So maybe 3?

Candidate 4: Seasonal resort—if it's still seasonal, then no transition. 1.

Candidate 1: Ghost town started as a town but didn't last. So it was a town but didn't sustain. Maybe a 2.

Candidate 7: Oil rig—maybe the workers' camps around it could be considered, but the rig itself isn't. So maybe 1?

Alternatively, maybe oil rig workers' camps? But the candidate is the rig. So no. 0?

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust.

Let me list all again:

1. Ghost town (mining that failed) → 2

2. Research station (permanent but not a town) → 3

3. Labor camps to towns → 10

4. Seasonal resort (no transition) → 1

5. Tent (individual) → 0

6. Cruise ship (mobile) →0

7. Oil rig (no transition) →1

8. Yurt (nomadic) →0

But maybe the research station could be a 4? Maybe some research stations have evolved into more permanent communities? Not sure. Maybe better to keep 3.

Alternatively, maybe the labor camps are 10, and the rest are lower.

Wait, the user wants the scores to be granular, so maybe:

1. Ghost town: started as a town but abandoned. It did transition but didn't sustain. Maybe 3?

But the theme requires evolving into a settled town. If it was a town but then abandoned, it didn't stay, so it's a partial match. Maybe 3.

2. Research station: functional outpost but not a town. 4?

3. 10

4. Seasonal resort: maybe 2?

5.0

6.0

7. 1

8.0

Alternatively, maybe the research station is a 5? Hmm.

Alternatively, the ski resort could be like a mining town if it started as a seasonal thing and then became a town. But the candidate is just the seasonal one. So maybe 2.

I think I need to proceed with my initial assessments but ensure the scores are spread out.

Final scores:

1. 2

2. 3

3. 10

4. 1

5.0

6.0

7.1

8.0

Wait, but maybe the oil rig's workers' camps could be considered, but the rig itself isn't a settlement. So oil rig is 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

Yes, I'll go with that.
