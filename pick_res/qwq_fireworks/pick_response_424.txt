Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what the specific theme is based on the examples and anti-examples provided. The examples given are river training wall, jetty, and wing dyke. The anti-examples are weir, dam, bridge pier.

So, starting with the examples: river training wall is a structure built along rivers to prevent erosion and manage the river's flow. A jetty is typically a structure extending into a body of water to protect a harbor or control currents. A wing dyke is like a V-shaped structure in a river to manage sediment and direct water flow. All three are related to managing water flow and preventing erosion, specifically in rivers or coastal areas.

Now the anti-examples: weir is a barrier across a river to divert or measure flow, which is more about controlling water level. Dams are structures to hold back water, creating reservoirs. Bridge piers support bridges over water but aren't primarily for erosion control or flow management. These are related but broader in purpose, more about water control or supporting structures rather than specifically training the river's path or managing sediment.

So the specific theme here seems to be structures specifically designed for river training, erosion control, and managing water flow in a river's course, not just any water management structure. Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this.

1. Floating dock: These are platforms on water, often for boats. They don't directly manage river flow or erosion. So probably low score. Maybe 2 or 3?

2. Groyne: These are structures built from the shore into the water to prevent erosion and manage sediment. That's exactly like the examples. So maybe 8 or 9?

3. Culvert: A pipe or channel under a road or embankment to let water flow. It's more about drainage than river training. Maybe 3?

4. Water wheel: A device using flowing water to generate power. Not related to erosion or flow management, more energy. Maybe 1?

5. Spillway: Manages excess water from dams, preventing overflow. It's part of a dam system, which is an anti-example. So maybe 4?

6. Canal: Artificial waterway, so more about redirecting water for transport, not river training. Maybe 2?

7. Lock gate: Part of canals or rivers to manage water levels between different elevations. Related to water control but not directly erosion. Maybe 4?

8. Fish ladder: Allows fish to bypass dams or weirs. It's an addition to structures like dams (anti-example). So maybe 1 or 2?

Wait, but I need to ensure the scores are spread across the range. Let me reassess:

Groyne is definitely a strong match (maybe 9). Floating dock is unrelated (0 or 1). Culvert is maybe a 2. Water wheel is 1. Spillway is connected to dams (anti-example), so 3. Canal is 2. Lock gate is part of canal systems, so 3. Fish ladder is 1. Hmm, but need to use the full range. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe spillway is a bit more related? It's for controlling water flow, but not specifically for river training. Maybe 3. Lock gates are part of managing water levels, but again, not erosion control. Maybe 4. Culverts are drainage, so 2. Floating dock is 1. Water wheel is 0? Wait, but the user said to use 0-10, so maybe even 0 is okay. Let me see:

1. Floating dock: 1 (since it's a structure on water but not for erosion or flow management)
2. Groyne: 9 (direct match)
3. Culvert: 2 (maybe helps with flow but not primary purpose)
4. Water wheel: 0 (completely unrelated)
5. Spillway: 3 (related to water control but part of a dam system)
6. Canal: 2 (man-made waterway, but not training the river)
7. Lock gate: 4 (part of canal/river management but not erosion)
8. Fish ladder: 1 (add-on to dams, not primary function)

Wait, but maybe some need higher. Let me think again. For example, lock gates might be part of a river's training? Not exactly. They're for navigation. Culverts are more drainage. So perhaps:

1. Floating dock: 1
2. Groyne: 9
3. Culvert: 2
4. Water wheel: 0
5. Spillway: 3
6. Canal: 2
7. Lock gate: 3
8. Fish ladder: 1

But to spread more, maybe some higher. Spillway could be 4. Lock gates 4. Let me see:

Alternatively, maybe the spillway is part of a dam, so anti-example, so lower. Culverts are more about drainage, so 2. Canal is 2. Floating dock 1. Water wheel 0. Groyne 9. Lock gates: part of managing water levels but not erosion control, maybe 4. Fish ladder 1. That seems okay. Let me assign numbers:

1. Floating dock: 1
2. Groyne: 9
3. Culvert: 2
4. Water wheel: 0
5. Spillway: 3
6. Canal: 2
7. Lock gate: 4
8. Fish ladder: 1

But maybe some are too low. The user said to use the full range. Let me check again. For example, lock gates might be 3 instead of 4. Culvert 2. Canal 2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe canal is 3 because it's a waterway but not exactly training. Alternatively, spillway is 3. Let me see if I can spread it more. Maybe:

1. Floating dock: 1
2. Groyne: 10 (since it's exactly like the examples)
Wait, the examples are river training wall, jetty, wing dyke. Groyne is similar to a jetty or wing dyke, so maybe 9 or 10. Let me check: Groyne is a structure built from the shore into the water to prevent erosion and direct currents. That's exactly the theme. So maybe 10? But the user said not to use 10s unless perfect. Since the examples are all 10, but maybe the candidates have to be compared. Since the examples are the theme, so groyne is a perfect match. So 10?

Wait, the user says "output its score as an integer" from 0-10. So if the candidate is exactly matching the theme, it's 10. So Groyne is a 10. Then the others:

Floating dock: 1. Culvert: 2. Water wheel: 0. Spillway: 3. Canal: 2. Lock gate: 3. Fish ladder:1. Then:

1. 1:1

2. 10

3.2

4.0

5.3

6.2

7.3

8.1

That uses 0,1,2,3,10. Maybe that's okay. Alternatively, maybe some others are higher. Let me see.

Lock gates: part of a system that manages water levels in a river, but not directly for training. Maybe 3. Spillway is part of a dam, so 3. Canal is a structure to divert water, but not for erosion control, so 2. Culvert 2. So yes, that's okay. Let me proceed with that.
