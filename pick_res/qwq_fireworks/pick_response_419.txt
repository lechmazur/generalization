Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the specific theme from the given examples. The examples are:

1. An instrument showing images as a lever is moved.
2. A tool revealing numbers when a dial is turned.
3. A device displaying new words/phrases on button press.

So, the common elements here are: an input action (moving a lever, turning a dial, pressing a button) that causes a device to present a sequence of items (images, numbers, words/phrases). The key points are the mechanical input (lever, dial, button) and the sequential display of different elements each time the input is used.

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. Smartphone app scrolling through info – this is more general, uses scrolling (maybe a touchscreen, not a specific mechanical input like a lever or dial), and the content is just scrolling, not a sequence triggered by an action.
2. Book with pages – turning pages is a different action, and it's a physical book, but the theme examples use specific controls (lever, dial, button), not flipping pages.
3. Magic cards – deck of cards is a different mechanism; shuffling or drawing cards isn't the same as a controlled input to step through a sequence.

The task is to evaluate each candidate based on how closely they match the specific theme (mechanical input leading to a new element in a sequence) while avoiding the broader themes seen in anti-examples.

Looking at the candidates:

1. Remote control changing TV channels. The input is a button press, which matches the button in the third example. However, changing channels is a common function, but does it present a "sequence"? It depends. If pressing a button cycles through channels in a fixed order, then yes. But remotes often let you jump to specific channels, not just sequential. So maybe a 5? Hmm, but the examples require each action to show the next in the sequence. If it's sequential, maybe 6-7. But maybe it's too general, like the smartphone app? Wait, the smartphone app is an anti-example because it's a broader use. The remote's channel change might be similar to the examples if it's a sequence. But I'm not sure. Maybe 5 or 6.

2. Gadget with symbols on knob twist. This directly matches the examples: a knob (like a dial) turned to reveal symbols (like numbers or images). So this should be a high score, maybe 8 or 9? Since it's very similar to the second example (dial turning to show sequence). Maybe 9?

3. Music player shuffles songs. Shuffling is random, not a sequence. The examples are about a series, which implies order. Shuffling would disrupt that. So this is a low score. Maybe 2 or 3.

4. Game controller navigating menus. Menus are hierarchical, not a linear sequence. Navigating through might involve moving up/down, but it's not a fixed sequence of items. So lower, maybe 3 or 4.

5. Fitness tracker showing different metrics. Pressing a button to cycle through heart rate, steps, etc. This could be similar to the third example (button press shows next in sequence). So maybe 7 or 8. But the examples are about a series of items (like images, numbers, phrases), while metrics are different data points. Not exactly the same, but close. Maybe 6?

6. Digital watch showing time formats. Pressing a button to switch between 12h and 24h, or maybe different time zones. It cycles through options, so similar to the button example. But it's two options, so maybe a fixed set, not a long sequence. Still, it fits the action -> next in sequence. Maybe 7?

7. Calculator doing sequential operations. Each operation is a step, but the display shows the result, not a sequence of items. The calculator's main purpose is computation, not presenting a series. So lower, like 3 or 4.

8. Camera cycling filters. Pressing a button to cycle through filters (like the button example). Each press shows next filter in sequence. This is very close to the examples. Maybe 8 or 9. But the examples are about images, numbers, phrases. Filters are different but the mechanism is similar. Maybe 8?

Wait, let me reassess each candidate again carefully.

1. Remote control: The action is pressing a button (like example 3), but changing channels. If it cycles through in order, then yes. But typically, remotes have a channel up/down, which is sequential. So maybe 7? Since it's similar to the button example (pressing to go to next). But the anti-example is the smartphone app scrolling. The difference is that the remote's channel change is a direct action per step, while the app might scroll continuously. So maybe 7.

2. Gadget with symbols via knob: Dial turning (like example 2) to show symbols. Direct match. 9.

3. Shuffling music: Random, not sequence. 2.

4. Game controller menus: Not a linear sequence. 3.

5. Fitness tracker: Button to cycle through metrics. Like example 3, but metrics vs phrases. 7.

6. Digital watch: Button to switch time formats. If it cycles through a sequence (like time, date, etc.), maybe 6. But if it's just two options, maybe lower. The question says "different formats" which could be multiple. Maybe 6-7. Let's say 7.

7. Calculator: Each operation step. The display shows results, not a series. 4.

8. Camera filters: Button cycles through filters. Like example 3. 8.

Hmm, but let me check if the examples require the sequence to be a list that progresses each time, like each action gives the next in order. The calculator's sequential operations might be part of an equation, but the display isn't showing a series of items. So definitely lower. 

So final scores:

1. Remote control: 7 (since it's button press leading to next in sequence, like example 3)

2. Gadget: 9 (dial and symbols, like example 2)

3. Music shuffle: 2 (random, not sequence)

4. Game controller: 3 (navigation isn't sequential display)

5. Fitness tracker: 7 (button cycles metrics, similar to phrases)

6. Watch: 6 (button cycles time formats, but maybe fewer steps)

7. Calculator: 4 (not a series display)

8. Camera filters: 8 (button cycles filters, close to example 3)
