Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the three examples (Berlin Wall demolition, Rosetta Stone, Gutenberg Bible) share, which the anti-examples (French, Industrial, American Revolutions) don't. 

Looking at the examples: The demolition of the Berlin Wall was a significant event symbolizing the end of division between East and West Germany. The Rosetta Stone was a key discovery that allowed the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs. The Gutenberg Bible's printing revolutionized the accessibility of information through movable type. 

What's common here? They all represent pivotal moments that either ended a division, unlocked knowledge, or drastically changed communication. They are singular events or developments with profound, often symbolic, impacts on history, culture, or knowledge. 

Now, the anti-examples are all revolutions. Revolutions are large-scale societal changes, often political, leading to fundamental shifts in governance. The key difference is that the examples are more about specific, tangible events or objects with immediate symbolic or practical impacts, whereas the anti-examples are broader movements over time. 

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. The end of WWII: This is a major event ending a global conflict. It's a specific point in time with huge consequences. It might fit the theme since it's an endpoint of division and conflict. But is it as symbolic as the Berlin Wall? Maybe. But maybe too broad? Hmm.

2. The fall of the Roman Empire: A long-term decline rather than a single event. It's more of a gradual process, so it might be similar to the anti-examples as a broader movement. So probably lower score.

3. The signing of the Magna Carta: A specific event that limited royal power, foundational for legal systems. It's a single, pivotal moment with lasting impact. This seems to fit the theme well.

4. The Black Death: A pandemic that drastically altered demographics and society. It's a significant event but more of a widespread phenomenon over years. Not a single object or event with a symbolic act, so maybe lower.

5. The launch of Sputnik: A singular event marking the start of the space age and Cold War tech race. Definitely a specific, impactful moment. High score likely.

6. The development of agriculture: A gradual shift in human society. Not a single event, so more like the anti-examples in being a process rather than an event. Low score.

7. The Civil Rights Movement: A prolonged social movement, not a single event. Even though it has key moments, the movement as a whole is a process, so probably a lower score.

8. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: A specific event that triggered WWI. It's a single act with massive consequences, similar to the examples. High score possible.

Wait, but let me check again. The examples are all events that either ended something, enabled understanding/knowledge (Rosetta Stone), or a transformative innovation (Gutenberg). The anti-examples are all revolutions (movements). 

So the theme might be: "Pivotal, singular events or innovations that had a massive, transformative impact on society, culture, or knowledge, not part of a larger revolution or prolonged process."

Applying that:

1. End of WWII: A specific endpoint, but maybe seen as part of the war's conclusion, which is a large process. Maybe a 6 or 7?

2. Fall of Rome: Not a single event, so 2-3.

3. Magna Carta: Specific event with legal impact. 8-9.

4. Black Death: Widespread event over time, so 3-4.

5. Sputnik: Definitely a single event. 9-10.

6. Agriculture: Process. 0-1.

7. Civil Rights Movement: Movement, so 1-2.

8. Archduke's assassination: Single event with huge consequences. 8-9.

But the anti-examples include revolutions, so movements are excluded. Let's adjust scores based on being singular events vs processes.

1. End of WWII: The actual end (like V-E Day/V-J Day) is a single event, but the war's end is a culmination of processes. Maybe 6.

2. Fall of Rome: 2.

3. Magna Carta: 9.

4. Black Death: 3 (since it's a series of events over years, but the outbreak is a start? Maybe a 4?)

5. Sputnik: 10.

6. Agriculture: 0.

7. Civil Rights: 1.

8. Assassination: 8.

Wait, but the user said not to use only 0s and 10s. Let me make sure the scores are spread out. Let me check each again.

The examples are all singular, impactful events/objects with immediate symbolic or practical significance. The anti-examples are movements/revolutions.

Candidate 1: End of WWII. It's a specific event (like surrender signings), but the war's end is part of a larger conflict. So maybe 6.

Candidate 2: Fall of Rome is a process over centuries, so 2.

Candidate3: Signing of Magna Carta is a single day, so 9.

Candidate4: Black Death started in 1347, spread over years, so not a single event. Maybe 3.

Candidate5: Sputnik was a specific launch date, so 10.

Candidate6: Agriculture's development is a gradual shift, so 0.

Candidate7: Civil Rights Movement is a decades-long movement, so 1.

Candidate8: Assassination is a single day (1914), leading to WWI, so 8.

That seems reasonable. Let me check again. Maybe the Civil Rights Movement's key events like the March on Washington or Brown v Board, but the movement as a whole is a process. So 1 is okay. The assassination is a direct trigger, so 8. Sputnik is a perfect fit. Magna Carta is a key document signed, so 9. End of WWII is an endpoint but part of a larger conflict, so 6. Fall of Rome is a process, 2. Black Death is a pandemic event but over years, 3. Agriculture is process, 0. Civil Rights Movement as movement, 1.
