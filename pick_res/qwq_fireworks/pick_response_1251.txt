Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided examples and anti-examples to help determine the specific theme. The key is to figure out what the examples have in common that the anti-examples don't, then apply that to the candidates.

First, looking at the examples:
1. Didgeridoo: Indigenous Australian instrument, traditional, gained global recognition in various genres.
2. Polynesian outrigger canoe: Traditional design influencing modern techniques.
3. Maori Haka: Traditional dance adopted globally in sports and culture.

The common theme here seems to be traditional cultural elements from specific regions that have been adopted or influenced global practices in their respective fields (music, boat design, performance). They started as local traditions and then spread internationally, impacting broader contexts beyond their origin.

Now the anti-examples:
1. Printing press: Revolutionized knowledge spread but isn't a cultural tradition from a specific group. More of a technological innovation with broad societal impact.
2. Compass: Essential tool for navigation, again a technological advancement but not tied to a specific culture's traditional practice.
3. Steam engine: Key to the Industrial Revolution, a major technological shift but not a cultural tradition.

So the distinction is that the theme is about traditional cultural practices originating from a specific group that have influenced global practices. The anti-examples are major technological or societal innovations not rooted in a specific cultural tradition but had wide impacts.

Now evaluating each candidate:

1. **Telescope**: An instrument advancing astronomy. It's a technological tool, not a cultural tradition. So probably low score, maybe 2. But wait, maybe some cultural aspect? Not really, it's a scientific tool. So 0-3.

2. **Inuit kayak**: Designed for hunting in Arctic, influenced modern recreational kayaking. This fits the theme: traditional from a specific culture (Inuit), influenced global use. So high score, maybe 8 or 9? The examples include similar items (outrigger canoe). So maybe 8 or 9.

3. **Electric light bulb**: Invention transforming daily life. A technological innovation, not a cultural tradition. So low score, maybe 1 or 2.

4. **Wheel**: Ancient invention fundamental to transport. A foundational tech, not tied to a specific culture's tradition. So low score, maybe 1 or 2. But the wheel is so ancient and widespread, maybe even more like an anti-example. So 0-2.

5. **Bicycle**: Influenced urban planning and mobility. While it's a transport, it's an invention, not a traditional cultural practice. Unless considering specific origins? Maybe low, 2-3. But not rooted in a specific traditional culture. So 2.

6. **Radio**: Transformed communication. Tech innovation, not cultural tradition. So low, maybe 1.

7. **Microscope**: Advanced science and medicine. Tech tool, not cultural. 0-2.

8. **Airplane**: Revolutionized transportation. Again, tech innovation. So low, maybe 1-2.

Wait, but the kayak example is a clear match. Let me recheck the examples and anti-examples. The anti-examples are all tech innovations. The theme is about traditional cultural elements influencing global practices. So kayak fits, telescope and others don't. Let me adjust:

Candidate 2 (Inuit kayak) is a strong match, so maybe 8 or 9. The others are tech or non-cultural, so 0-3. Let me assign scores accordingly.
