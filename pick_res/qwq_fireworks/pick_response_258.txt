Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that connects the three examples given: a dry-stone wall, a Jenga tower, and a K'NEX model. The anti-examples are a LEGO creation glued together, a welded metal sculpture, and a glued wooden chair. 

So, looking at the examples, what's common among them? Dry-stone walls are built without mortar, using stones fit together by interlocking. Jenga towers are made of wooden blocks stacked without glue, relying on balance. K'NEX models are interlocking plastic pieces that snap together. The key here seems to be structures held together through physical interlocking or friction, not using adhesives or fasteners like glue, nails, or welding.

The anti-examples all use some form of adhesive (glue, welding) or fixed fasteners (nails) to hold them together. So the specific theme is probably structures that are assembled without adhesives or permanent fasteners, relying on the pieces fitting together mechanically.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. **A woven basket**: Baskets are made by weaving materials like wood or reeds. The interlacing holds it together without adhesives. This seems to fit the theme. But wait, some baskets might use glue, but traditionally they're woven. Since the question is about the specific theme, and woven structures rely on interlocking, this should be a good match. Maybe a 7 or 8?

2. **A brick wall with mortar**: Mortar is like glue here. The examples avoid using mortar, so this is more like an anti-example. So probably a 1 or 2.

3. **A card house**: Cards are balanced and stacked without adhesives. They rely on the shape and balance of the cards. This should be a strong match, maybe 8 or 9. Wait, but the examples include Jenga which is similar. So maybe 9?

4. **A nailed birdhouse**: Nails are fasteners, so similar to the anti-examples. This is using nails instead of glue, but the theme is about not using any adhesives or fixed fasteners. So this is worse. Maybe a 2 or 3.

5. **A zipper**: Zippers interlock through their teeth. They don't use glue or nails. The teeth lock together when closed. This seems to fit the theme. A zipper is a mechanical fastener without adhesives. Maybe a 7 or 8.

6. **A dovetail joint**: This is a type of woodworking joint where the pieces interlock like a puzzle. No glue or nails needed, though sometimes glue is used. But traditionally, dovetail joints can be made just by fitting the pieces. So this should be a strong match. Maybe 8 or 9.

7. **A mortise and tenon joint**: Similar to dovetail, this is a traditional joint where a tenon fits into a mortise. Often used without glue in some contexts (like traditional furniture). So also a strong match. Maybe 8 or 9.

8. **A jigsaw puzzle**: The pieces interlock exactly. No adhesives, just the shape of the pieces. So this should be a perfect 10? Wait, but the examples include Jenga and K'NEX. Jigsaw puzzles are even more about precise interlocking. But maybe the difference is that jigsaw puzzles are 2D and the examples are 3D structures? Hmm, but the theme is about the method of joining. So maybe 9 or 10. Wait, the anti-examples are about using adhesives. Since jigsaw doesn't use any, it's a good fit. Maybe 9.

Wait, but let me check again. The examples are all 3D structures. A jigsaw is 2D, but the principle is the same. So maybe still a high score. Let me adjust the scores based on that.

Wait, the specific theme is the method of joining without adhesives or fixed fasteners, so even if it's 2D, the jigsaw puzzle is a perfect example. So maybe 10. But the original examples didn't include puzzles. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme requires structural integrity through stacking or interlocking parts in a way that's more like building. Jigsaw puzzles are flat, so maybe slightly less? Not sure. Alternatively, since the examples include K'NEX (3D), Jenga (3D), dry stone (3D), maybe jigsaw is a bit different. But the core is interlocking without adhesives. So perhaps 9.

Now let's go back and assign scores more carefully, ensuring they are nuanced and spread out.

1. Woven basket: 7 or 8. Maybe 8? Because weaving is interlocking, similar to K'NEX's interlocking pieces.

2. Brick with mortar: 1. Since mortar is like glue, this is an anti-example. So 1.

3. Card house: 9. Like Jenga but with cards. High match.

4. Nailed birdhouse: 2. Uses nails, so worse than mortar. Maybe 2.

5. Zipper: 7. Because it's a linear interlock, maybe slightly less than the structural examples but still fits.

6. Dovetail joint: 9. High interlocking without glue.

7. Mortise and tenon: 8 or 9. Maybe 9, but since dovetail is more complex, maybe 8? Or same as dovetail. Hmm, perhaps 9.

8. Jigsaw puzzle: 10? Or 9. Since it's a perfect interlock but 2D. Maybe 9 to stay under 10. Alternatively, if the theme is about the joining method, then 10. Let me think. The examples include 3D structures, but the theme is about the method. So if the jigsaw uses no adhesives or fasteners, it's a perfect match. So 10? But the original examples didn't have puzzles, so maybe the scorer might think it's a bit off. Alternatively, maybe 9. Hmm, tricky. Maybe 9 to be safe.

Wait, the anti-examples are glued things. The theme is specifically the exact theme of the examples. So the exact theme is structures held together by interlocking parts without adhesives or fasteners. A jigsaw puzzle is exactly that. So maybe 10 is okay. Let's see:

Let me try to assign:

1. Woven basket: 8 (interlocking but maybe not as modular as K'NEX)

2. Brick with mortar: 1 (definitely an anti-example)

3. Card house: 9 (similar to Jenga, high match)

4. Nailed birdhouse: 2 (nails are fasteners, so worse than mortar)

5. Zipper: 7 (mechanical but linear, not structural in 3D)

6. Dovetail joint: 9 (strong interlock)

7. Mortise and tenon: 9 (similar to dovetail, maybe 9)

8. Jigsaw puzzle: 10 (perfect interlock, no adhesives)

Wait, but maybe the theme requires being a structure or building, so jigsaw is a flat object. Maybe that's why it's 9 instead of 10. Alternatively, since the examples include K'NEX which can be any structure, maybe it's okay. Hmm. Alternatively, the problem says "the specific theme identified from the examples but not with the broader, related, or general theme based on the anti-examples". The examples include 3D structures, so maybe jigsaw is a bit more distant. Let me adjust jigsaw to 9, and card house to 9 as well. Let me make sure all scores are unique or at least spread out.

Alternatively, let's see:

1. Woven basket: 8

2. 1

3. 9

4. 2

5. 7

6. 9

7. 8

8. 9

Wait, but that might have duplicates. Let me try to distribute:

1. 8

2.1

3.9

4.2

5.7

6.9

7.8

8.10

Hmm, that gives 10 for jigsaw. Maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the dovetail and mortise are both 9, the card house 9, jigsaw 9, but that's too many 9s. The user wants a graded scale. Let's try:

1. Woven basket: 7 (since it's woven, maybe less modular than K'NEX)

2.1

3.9

4.2

5.6 (zipper is a linear joint, less structural)

6.9 (dovetail is strong)

7.8 (mortise and tenon is also good but maybe a bit more traditional)

8.9 (jigsaw puzzle)

Wait, but then jigsaw is 9, card house 9, dovetail 9. Maybe that's okay as they are all high. Alternatively, to differentiate:

Card house (3) is 9.5 but since it's integer, 9 or 10.

Alternatively, let me try to assign each a unique score:

1. Woven basket: 7 (interlocking but not as precise as dovetail)

2.1

3.9 (card house is very much like Jenga, so top)

4.2

5.6 (zipper is a fastener but not structural)

6.8 (dovetail is great but maybe not as modular as K'NEX)

7.9 (mortise and tenon is also a good joint)

8.10 (jigsaw is perfect interlock)

Hmm, that way:

Card house 9, jigsaw 10, dovetail 9, mortise 8?

Alternatively:

Wait, maybe the jigsaw is a better fit because it's exactly about interlocking pieces without anything else. So 10 is okay. Let's go with that. So final scores:

1. 8 (woven basket)

2. 1 (brick with mortar)

3.9 (card house)

4.2 (nailed)

5.7 (zipper)

6.9 (dovetail)

7.8 (mortise and tenon)

8.10 (jigsaw)

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be granular and use the full range. Let me check each again:

- The examples are all about interlocking without adhesives. So the best match would be things that are exactly like that. The anti-examples use adhesives or welding.

- Jigsaw puzzle is a perfect example, so 10.

- Card house is like Jenga (which is an example), so 9.

- Dovetail and mortise are joints without glue, so 9 and 8? Maybe dovetail is 9, mortise 8.

- Woven basket is 7 or 8. Maybe 8 because it's interlocking.

- Zipper is 7.

- Mortise and tenon is 8.

- Nailed is 2, brick with mortar 1.

Wait, but let's ensure all numbers are covered. Let's see:

1. 8

2.1

3.9

4.2

5.7

6.9

7.8

8.10

So the scores are 1,2,7,8,8,9,9,10. Maybe adjust some:

Mortise and tenon (7) to 8, dovetail 9, jigsaw 10, card 9, woven 8.

Alternatively, maybe the woven basket is 7 because it's not built up like a structure but a container. So:

1. 7

2.1

3.9

4.2

5.6 (zipper is a linear fastener)

6.9 (dovetail)

7.8 (mortise)

8.10 (jigsaw)

That gives 7,1,9,2,6,9,8,10. That's better spread.

Alternatively, maybe the zipper is 7 instead of 6. Because it's definitely a mechanical joint without adhesives. So 7.

Then the scores:

1.7

2.1

3.9

4.2

5.7

6.9

7.8

8.10

Now, the scores are 1,2,7,7,8,9,9,10. Hmm, two 7s. Maybe the woven basket is 8 and the zipper 7.

Yes, that would make:

1.8 (basket)

2.1

3.9 (card)

4.2 (nailed)

5.7 (zipper)

6.9 (dovetail)

7.8 (mortise)

8.10 (jigsaw)

Now scores are 8,1,9,2,7,9,8,10. Still duplicates but maybe acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the mortise and tenon is 9, dovetail 9, card 9, jigsaw 10, so three 9s. But that's okay as they are close.

Alternatively, the user wants as much spread as possible, so maybe:

1. A woven basket: 7 (since weaving is interlocking but maybe not the same as building up)

2. 1

3.9 (card house is like Jenga)

4.2

5.6 (zipper is a linear fastener)

6.9 (dovetail is strong)

7.8 (mortise and tenon)

8.10 (jigsaw)

That way, the scores go from 1 to 10, with 6,7,8,9,10 covered. The duplicates are okay as per the instructions allowing nuanced scores.

So final scores:

1. 7

2.1

3.9

4.2

5.6

6.9

7.8

8.10
