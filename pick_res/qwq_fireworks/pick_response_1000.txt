Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are footprints in sand after walking, scorch marks from fireworks, and skid marks from a car. All these are temporary marks or traces left after an event. They’re physical, short-lived, and result from an action that's already completed. 

Now, the anti-examples are things like tattoos, scars, and echoes. Tattoos and scars are permanent, so they don't fit the temporary aspect. Echoes are temporary but they're sound, not a physical mark. So the theme must be about temporary physical traces left by an event, right?

Looking at the candidates:

1. Statue in a park: Permanent. So that's an anti-example. Score 0 or low.
2. Contrails from airplane: Those are temporary, like the examples. They disappear, so maybe high score.
3. Graffiti artwork: If it's permanent, like a mural, then it's more like the anti-examples. So low score.
4. Thunder after lightning: Sound, not a physical mark. So similar to the echo anti-example. Lower score.
5. Memorial plaque: Permanent. Definitely an anti-example. Low score.
6. Engraving on jewelry: Permanent. So 0.
7. Monument: Also permanent. Anti-example. Low.
8. Mural on wall: If it's permanent, like graffiti as art, then same as anti-examples. Low.

Wait, but need to be careful. The key is the specific theme. The examples are all immediate, transient results of an action. The anti-examples are either permanent or non-physical. So:

Contrails (2) are transient, physical痕迹, so high like 8 or 9. 

Thunder (4) is sound, so maybe 1 or 2. 

Graffiti as permanent (3) would be 0 or 1. 

Statue, plaque, engraving, monument, mural are all permanent structures, so 0-2. 

Mural might be considered more like graffiti as art but still permanent, so similar to anti-examples. 

So assigning scores:

1. Statue: 0
2. Contrails: 9
3. Graffiti (permanent): 1
4. Thunder: 2 (since it's temporary but not physical mark)
5. Plaque: 0
6. Engraving: 0
7. Monument: 0
8. Mural: 1

Wait, but maybe some need more nuance. For instance, contrails might last longer than footprints but still temporary. Maybe 8 instead of 9. Thunder is an effect but not a mark, so maybe 1. Graffiti as permanent artwork is like the anti-examples, so 1. Mural same as 1. 

So adjusting:

1. 0
2. 8
3. 1
4. 1
5. 0
6. 0
7. 0
8. 1

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Maybe some can be mid. Let me think again.

The examples are all physical traces left immediately after an action. The anti-examples are permanent (tattoo, scar) or non-physical (echo). 

Candidate 2 (contrails) is a physical trace (water vapor) that fades, so very close to the theme. Maybe 9.

Candidate 4 (thunder) is sound, so even though it's temporary, it's not a physical mark. So 2.

Candidates 3 (graffiti) and 8 (mural) are both permanent, so same as anti-examples. Maybe 1 each.

Candidates 1,5,6,7 are all permanent structures, so 0.

So:

1. 0

2. 9

3. 1

4. 2

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 1

That seems to fit. Let me check again. The murals and graffiti as permanent would be like the anti-examples (tattoos, scars) which are permanent. So they’re 1. Contrails are a strong match. Thunder is a weak match because it's sound. The rest are 0.
