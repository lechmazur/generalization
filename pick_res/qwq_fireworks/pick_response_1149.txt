Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples a radar display, a compass rose, and a ship's wheel all share. Let me think about each of them.

A radar display is circular and shows direction and distance, often with a center point and radial lines. A compass rose is also circular, indicating directions like north, south, etc., with spokes radiating from the center. A ship's wheel is round and used for steering, with spokes leading to the center. So the common theme here seems to be something circular with spokes or radial symmetry, possibly related to navigation or control. 

Now the anti-examples are a merry-go-round, a ferris wheel, and a vinyl record. These are all circular and have a central axis, but they might not have the navigational or control aspect. The merry-go-round and ferris wheel are amusement rides, while a vinyl record is for playing music. The key difference here is that the anti-examples are more about rotation or entertainment, not necessarily navigation or a functional control interface with radial elements.

So the specific theme is likely circular objects with radial symmetry used in navigation or control systems, each having a central point with spokes or directional elements. Now, let's evaluate each candidate against this theme.

1. **A Buddhist mandala**: Mandalas are circular, intricate designs with radial symmetry. They're symbolic and spiritual, not navigational or for control. So they fit the circular/spokes aspect but not the functional use case. Maybe a 4 or 5? But since they’re not for navigation, maybe lower. Let me think. Since the theme is about navigation/control tools, mandala might be a 3.

2. **A tornado**: Tornadoes are funnel-shaped, swirling, but not necessarily with spokes. They’re natural phenomena, not man-made tools. The shape is more spiral than radial spokes. So probably a 2 or 3. Maybe 2.

3. **A tire**: Tires are circular, have spokes (if we consider the tread patterns or actual wheel spokes). But a tire alone might just be a circle without the functional control aspect unless part of a vehicle's steering. Maybe a 5? Hmm, but maybe lower because it's more structural than navigational. Maybe 4.

4. **A CD**: CDs are circular with a central hole and data stored in concentric circles. They don't have spokes, but the structure is radial. Their purpose is data storage, not navigation. So maybe 3? Or maybe 2 since they don't have spokes but are radial in data layout. Maybe 3.

5. **A coin**: Coins are circular, often with designs, but not necessarily spokes or radial elements unless the design has them. Most coins have a head and tail, maybe some radial patterns. If it's a regular coin without spokes, then maybe 2. But some coins have radial designs. Maybe a 3 or 4. Let's say 3.

6. **A pinwheel**: This has spokes and is circular, often used as a toy. The structure is radial with spokes, but it's a toy, not navigational. So it's similar to the anti-examples. The theme requires a navigational/control aspect, so maybe 5? Because it has the radial structure but not the function. Hmm, but the anti-examples include ferris wheel which is radial but not navigational. Since pinwheel is a toy, it's like an anti-example, so maybe lower. Maybe 2 or 3. Let's say 3.

7. **A galaxy**: Galaxies are often depicted as circular with spiral arms, which can be seen as radial. They’re natural, not tools. So maybe 2 or 3. Since they’re not man-made or functional, probably 2.

8. **A frisbee**: Circular, flat, but no spokes. It's a toy, so similar to anti-examples. Shape is circle but no radial elements. So maybe 1 or 2. Let's say 2.

Wait, let me recheck:

The examples are radar (navigation tool with radial lines), compass rose (directional), ship's wheel (steering). So the key is both circular with radial elements AND used in navigation or control. 

Mandalas: Not navigation, but radial. So maybe 3.

Tornado: No spokes, natural. 1 or 2.

Tire: If part of a wheel system (like a ship's wheel), but a tire is just part of a car's wheel. Maybe a car's steering wheel is similar to a ship's, but a tire itself isn't. So tire might be lower. Maybe 3?

CD: No spokes, just concentric circles. 2.

Coin: Some have radial lines, but maybe not. 2 or 3.

Pinwheel: Radial but toy, so similar to anti-examples. 3.

Galaxy: Natural, no spokes. 1.

Frisbee: No spokes, toy. 1.

Hmm, maybe adjust:

1. Mandala: 3

2. Tornado: 2

3. Tire: Maybe 4? If considering the wheel's spokes, but tire alone? Maybe 3.

4. CD: 2

5. Coin: 3

6. Pinwheel: 3

7. Galaxy: 1

8. Frisbee: 1

But maybe Tire (if considering as part of a wheel, like ship's wheel which has spokes) would be higher. A tire's structure has a circular shape with radial patterns in the tread, but not spokes like a wheel. So maybe 3.

Alternatively, if the ship's wheel has spokes, a tire's structure (like a car wheel with spokes) would be similar. But the tire itself (rubber part) doesn't have spokes. The wheel (rim and spokes) does. So maybe tire is 2. Hmm, tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the tire's circular shape with radial symmetry (like tread patterns) could be a 4? Not sure. Maybe 3 is safer.

Final scores:

1. 3

2. 2

3. 3

4. 2

5. 3

6. 3

7. 1

8. 1

Wait, but the user wants a full range from 0-10. Maybe some can be higher? Let me see again.

Wait, maybe the galaxy could be 2, frisbee 1, tornado 2, etc. Maybe:

1. Mandala: 3 (radial but not navigation)

2. Tornado: 2 (circular but no spokes)

3. Tire: 3 (circular, but maybe part of a wheel system)

4. CD: 2 (circular, concentric but no spokes)

5. Coin: 3 (some have radial designs)

6. Pinwheel: 3 (radial but not navigational)

7. Galaxy: 1 (natural, no spokes)

8. Frisbee: 1 (flat circle, no spokes)

Alternatively, maybe Tire is a 4? Since a car's steering wheel is similar to a ship's wheel, but the tire itself is just part of that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the Tire's structure (if considering the wheel with spokes) would be a 5? But the question says "a tire" not "a car wheel". So Tire is just the rubber part, so probably lower.

Alternatively, maybe the Tire's circular shape with radial symmetry in the tread could be a 4? Maybe 3.

I think I'll stick with the initial scores but ensure they are spread out more. Maybe some can be 4 or 5.

Wait, let me think again. The examples are all navigation or control tools with radial symmetry. So the key is the function (navigation/control) plus the radial structure.

Mandalas don't have the function, but have radial structure. So maybe 3.

Tornado: No function, shape is spiral, not radial spokes. 1.

Tire: If part of a vehicle's steering system, maybe 4? But tire alone isn't steering. So maybe 2.

CD: No function related, but circular. 2.

Coin: Maybe 3 if it has radial designs, but generally not. 2.

Pinwheel: 3 because it has spokes but wrong function.

Galaxy: 1.

Frisbee:1.

Alternatively, maybe the Tire's circular shape with radial symmetry in the tread could be a 4? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the Tire's structure as part of a wheel (even if it's the rubber part) could be considered as part of a circular object with radial elements (the wheel's spokes are part of the wheel, but the tire is just around it). Not sure. Maybe 3.

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 1

3. 2

4. 2

5. 2

6. 3

7. 1

8. 1

Wait, but the user wants a nuanced scale. Maybe some higher. Let's see:

A galaxy is circular but not spokes. 1.

Frisbee: 0? But user said to use 0-10. Maybe 1.

Tornado: 1.

Tire: Maybe 2 or 3. 

Mandalas: 3.

Pinwheel: 4? Because it has spokes but wrong function. Since the anti-examples include ferris wheel (which is radial but not navigational), pinwheel is similar, so maybe 3.

Hmm, perhaps:

1. Mandala: 4 (radial, but not function)

2. Tornado: 1 (no spokes, natural)

3. Tire: 2 (circular, but not spokes)

4. CD: 2 (circular, concentric)

5. Coin: 3 (if some have radial lines, maybe)

6. Pinwheel: 3 (radial structure but wrong use)

7. Galaxy: 1

8. Frisbee: 1

Alternatively, maybe Tire's circular shape with radial symmetry in tread could be 3, and coin as 3.

Hmm, this is tricky. I'll proceed with my initial thought but adjust to spread the scores more. Let me try:

1. Mandala: 4 (radial design, but not navigation)

2. Tornado: 1 (no spokes)

3. Tire: 3 (circular, maybe part of a system)

4. CD: 2 (circular, concentric)

5. Coin: 3 (some coins have radial patterns)

6. Pinwheel: 4 (radial spokes, but not navigational)

7. Galaxy: 1

8. Frisbee: 1

Wait, but the anti-examples include ferris wheel which is radial but not navigational. So pinwheel is similar, so maybe 3.

Alternatively, if the specific theme requires both radial AND navigation/control, then anything missing the function gets lower. So the scores would be lower.

So perhaps:

1. Mandala: 3 (radial but not function)

2. Tornado: 2 (circular but no spokes)

Wait, tornado is a funnel shape, not exactly a circle. Maybe 1.

3. Tire: 3 (circular, part of vehicle which uses steering, but tire itself is just part. Maybe 3)

4. CD: 2 (circular, no spokes)

5. Coin: 2 (maybe 3 if some coins have radial lines)

6. Pinwheel: 3 (radial structure but wrong function)

7. Galaxy:1

8. Frisbee:1

Hmm, I think I'll finalize with this:

1. 3

2. 1

3. 3

4. 2

5. 3

6. 3

7. 1

8. 1

But the user wants a nuanced scale. Maybe some differences. Let me check each again.

A galaxy: circular with spiral arms (radial-like), but not spokes. So maybe 2?

Frisbee: 1, since it's just a flat circle without spokes.

Tornado: 1.

Mandalas: 3.

Tire: 3 (since it's part of a wheel system which has spokes, even if the tire itself is just rubber, the overall wheel including tire is part of vehicle control. But the tire alone? Hmm. Maybe 2.)

CD: 2.

Coin: 3 (if the design includes radial elements).

Pinwheel: 3.

Galaxy: 2.

Frisbee:1.

So:

1. Mandala: 3

2. Tornado:1

3. Tire: 2

4. CD:2

5. Coin:3

6. Pinwheel:3

7. Galaxy:2

8. Frisbee:1

That spreads more. So the scores would be:

1.3

2.1

3.2

4.2

5.3

6.3

7.2

8.1

Alternatively, maybe galaxy gets 2, which is better than tornado's 1.

Okay, I think this is as close as I can get. Let me list them as per the instructions.
