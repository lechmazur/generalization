Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are thermoluminescence dating of ceramics, potassium-argon dating of volcanic rocks, and uranium-thorium dating of coral reefs. 

Looking at these, they all seem to be radiometric dating methods. But wait, each example pairs a specific dating technique with a particular type of material. Thermoluminescence is for ceramics, potassium-argon for volcanic rocks, and uranium-thorium for coral. So the theme might be radiometric dating techniques specifically applied to their most appropriate or common materials. 

Now the anti-examples are obsidian hydration dating, amino acid racemization, and electron spin resonance dating. These are also dating methods, but they don't fit the exact theme. Why? Maybe because they are applied to different materials. Obsidian hydration is for volcanic glass, amino acid racemization for proteins, and ESR for things like teeth or shells. The anti-examples might not pair the method with the specific material that's the hallmark of the theme. 

So the specific theme here is radiometric dating methods that are tied to a particular type of material where they are most commonly or specifically applied. The key is the combination of the dating technique and the material it's applied to. The examples all have that specific pairing, while the anti-examples either use a different material or perhaps a non-radiometric method? Wait, amino acid racemization isn't radiometric. Hmm, so maybe the theme is more about radiometric methods paired with specific materials. 

Looking again, the examples are all radiometric: thermoluminescence (involves trapped electrons from radioactive decay), potassium-argon (isotopic decay), uranium-thorium (also isotopic). The anti-examples: obsidian hydration is a form of hydration dating, which is a chemical method, not radiometric. Amino acid racemization is chemical, and electron spin resonance can be used with radiation dosage, maybe related to thermoluminescence but perhaps not strictly radiometric dating in the same way. 

Therefore, the specific theme is radiometric dating techniques applied to specific materials. The anti-examples either use non-radiometric methods or apply radiometric methods to different materials. 

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. Archaeomagnetic dating: This uses changes in Earth's magnetic field recorded in baked clay or materials. It's not radiometric. So it's an anti-example type. Score low, maybe 1 or 2.

2. Dendrochronology: Tree ring dating. Non-radiometric, based on annual growth rings. Definitely not radiometric. Score 0 or 1.

3. Radiocarbon dating of organic materials: Radiocarbon is a radiometric method, and it's used on organic materials. But wait, the original examples had specific pairings like ceramics, volcanic rocks, coral reefs. Carbon dating is a common method but paired with organic materials. Since the examples include pairings of method and material, this should be a high score. Wait, but the anti-examples include ESR which is radiometric but maybe paired with a different material. Since the theme is radiometric paired with specific materials, then radiocarbon on organic is a match. So maybe a 10? But wait, original examples are more specific materials (like coral reefs, volcanic rocks). Organic is broader. Hmm, maybe 8? Because it's a radiometric method with its common material, but maybe not as specific as the examples. Alternatively, the original examples are all isotopic decay methods (uranium-thorium, potassium-argon) whereas radiocarbon is a different isotope (C14). But the key is the pairing. The examples pair the method with a material where it's most applicable. Since radiocarbon is used on organic, which is the standard, perhaps it's a 10. But wait, the anti-examples include amino acid racemization which is organic, but that's non-radiometric. So maybe 10? But maybe the user thinks the examples are about specific non-organic materials? Let me check again. The examples are ceramics (non-organic), volcanic rocks, coral reefs (which are organic, but uranium-thorium is used on them). So coral is organic, but paired with uranium-thorium. So maybe the key is the specific method-material pair, not the organic/non-organic. So radiocarbon on organic would be a good match. So maybe 10. But the anti-examples have ESR which is radiometric but maybe used on other materials. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme requires that the material is a specific type (like volcanic rocks, ceramics, coral reefs) rather than a broad category like organic. So organic is too broad. Then maybe 7? Hmm, tricky.

4. Cosmogenic nuclide dating: This uses exposure to cosmic rays, often on rocks at Earth's surface. It's radiometric, measuring isotopes like beryllium-10. The material here would be surface rocks or sediments. So pairing cosmogenic nuclides with surface materials. That's a specific pairing. So maybe a high score like 9 or 10? Because it's radiometric and specific material.

5. Varve chronology: Annual layers in sediment (like lake varves). Non-radiometric, based on annual deposition. So score 0 or 1.

6. Stratigraphic layering in archaeology: This is a relative dating method, not radiometric. So 0.

7. Tree ring analysis: Same as dendrochronology, so 0.

8. Ice core sampling: This can involve several methods, but the primary dating is through layer counting or chemical analysis, not radiometric. Though there might be some isotopic analysis, the main dating isn't radiometric. So score 0 or 1.

Wait, need to think again for candidate 3: radiocarbon dating of organic materials. The original examples are all radiometric paired with specific materials. Since radiocarbon is a radiometric method applied to organic materials, which is its standard use, it should fit the theme. The anti-examples include ESR, which is radiometric but maybe used on different materials (like tooth enamel). So radiocarbon on organic is a match. So maybe 10. But perhaps the original examples have more specific materials (like coral reefs instead of just organic). But coral reefs are a subset of organic. Hmm. Alternatively, the theme is that each example's material is a specific type (ceramics, volcanic rocks, coral reefs) rather than a broad category. Organic is broader, so maybe it's less specific. Then maybe 8. Alternatively, the key is that the method is tied to the material's composition. For example, potassium-argon in volcanic rocks because they contain K; uranium-thorium in coral because they have uranium. Similarly, radiocarbon is in organic because of carbon. So the pairing is correct. So 10. But the anti-examples include amino acid racemization (organic, non-radiometric) and obsidian hydration (obsidian, non-radiometric). So the theme is radiometric + material where the method is applied. So candidate 3 is a perfect fit. So 10.

Candidate 4: cosmogenic nuclides. The material is surface rocks or sediments exposed to cosmic rays. So the method is cosmogenic nuclide dating, applied to those materials. That's a specific pairing. So 10? Or maybe 9 because it's a different type of radiometric dating (exposure dating vs. decay dating). But the original examples include different types (thermoluminescence is trapped charge, potassium-argon is decay). So as long as it's radiometric and paired with a specific material, it's okay. So maybe 10.

Wait, but let me check the anti-examples. The anti-examples are obsidian hydration (non-radiometric), amino acid (non-radiometric), ESR (radiometric but maybe used on materials not in the examples). If ESR is a radiometric method but applied to different materials (like teeth or coral?), then it's an anti-example because it's radiometric but not paired with the specific materials in the original examples. Wait, but uranium-thorium is on coral reefs, which might involve ESR? Not sure. Maybe ESR is used on teeth or other materials. So the anti-examples are either non-radiometric or radiometric but with different materials. So cosmogenic nuclide on surface rocks is a valid pairing, so it should be a 10. 

Wait, but the original examples are all methods that date the material itself (ceramics, volcanic rocks, coral). Cosmogenic dates the exposure time, not the age of the material itself. Hmm, that's a different application. So maybe that's why it's not a perfect match. So perhaps 8. Because the original examples are about dating the material's age through its composition, whereas cosmogenic is about exposure. So maybe it's a bit different, hence lower score.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me reassess:

The original theme examples are all radiometric dating techniques applied to specific materials where the technique is most appropriate. The key is the combination of the method and the material. So:

- Thermoluminescence: used on ceramics (which have trapped electrons from heating)
- Potassium-argon: on volcanic rocks (which have K that decays to Ar)
- Uranium-thorium: on coral (which incorporates U, which decays to Th)

These are all methods that measure the age of the material itself based on isotopic decay or trapped energy. 

Now, cosmogenic nuclide dating is used on rocks at the Earth's surface to measure exposure time to cosmic rays. The material is surface rocks, but the dating is about how long they've been exposed, not their formation age. So maybe that's a different use case. Therefore, it's a related method but not exactly the same as the examples, which are about the material's formation age. So perhaps it's a 7 or 8.

Radiocarbon dating on organic materials: that's exactly the same structure. The method (radiocarbon) is applied to the material (organic) to date when the organism died. So that's a perfect match. So 10.

Archaeomagnetic dating (candidate 1) is non-radiometric, so 0 or 1.

Varve (5) is non-radiometric, 0.

Stratigraphic layering (6) is relative dating, 0.

Tree rings (7) same as 2, 0.

Ice cores (8) can have some isotopic analysis but the primary dating is layer counting, so 0 or 1.

So candidate 3: 10, candidate 4: 8? Or 9?

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are all isotopic decay methods. Cosmogenic nuclides are also isotopic (produced via cosmic rays), so maybe it's a good fit. Then 10. But the purpose is exposure time, not the material's age. Hmm, maybe 8 because of that difference.

Dendrochronology and varve are 0, stratigraphy 0.

Archaeomagnetic 0 or 1.

Ice core 0.

So tentative scores:

1. Archaeomagnetic: 0 (non-radiometric)

2. Dendro: 0

3. Radiocarbon:10

4. Cosmogenic:8 (since it's radiometric but different application)

5. Varve:0

6. Stratigraphic:0

7. Tree ring:0

8. Ice core:0

Wait but let me check candidate 4 again. The question says the anti-examples could be following a broader theme. The theme here is the specific pairing of radiometric method with material for dating that material's age. Cosmogenic is for exposure time, not the material's own age. So it's a different purpose, so less of a match. So maybe 7.

Alternatively, maybe the theme doesn't care about the purpose but just the method-material pairing. If cosmogenic is paired with surface rocks, then it's a valid pairing. So 10?

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that all the examples are about dating the material's formation or deposition, while cosmogenic is about exposure. So it's a different use case. So maybe 7.

Alternatively, if the theme is just radiometric paired with a specific material regardless of purpose, then 10. Since the anti-examples include non-radiometric methods, the key is radiometric plus specific material. Cosmogenic is radiometric and has a specific material (surface rocks), so 10. 

I think the key is that the examples are all radiometric methods applied to a specific material where the method is most commonly used for that material. Cosmogenic is used on surface rocks, so that's a good match. So 10.

Wait, but the anti-example ESR might be radiometric but used on teeth or something else, so that's why it's an anti-example. So if cosmogenic is a radiometric method applied to its specific material, it's a match. So 10.

So adjusting:

1. 0

2.0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

Wait, but ice core sampling might have some radiometric aspects, like carbon dating of organic material in ice cores. But the primary method is layer counting. So unless the candidate specifies radiocarbon in ice cores, it's not. The candidate says "ice core sampling" generally, so 0.

Candidate 4: cosmogenic nuclide dating. If it's paired with surface rocks, then it's a good match. So 10.

Candidate 3: radiocarbon on organic is perfect, so 10.

Now, what about candidate 4's score? Let's see the examples again. The examples include three different radiometric methods each with a specific material. Cosmogenic is another such pairing, so it's a good example. Hence 10.

So then:

1. Archaeomagnetic: 0

2. Dendro:0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But wait, the user said to use a granular scale, not just 0 and 10. Maybe I'm being too strict.

Wait, perhaps some candidates are partially matching. Let's think again.

Candidate 1: archaeomagnetic. It's a dating method, but non-radiometric. So it's like the anti-examples which include non-radiometric methods. So it should be low, like 1 or 2.

Candidate 4: cosmogenic. If it's a valid radiometric method with specific material, then 10. But maybe the theme requires that the material is a specific type (like coral reefs, which are a specific environment), while cosmogenic is more general (any surface rocks). So maybe 8.

Alternatively, since the examples include volcanic rocks (a broad category?), but the anti-examples have obsidian (a specific volcanic glass). Hmm, maybe the examples have specific materials. Coral reefs are specific, volcanic rocks are a class. So cosmogenic on surface rocks is a broader material category than volcanic rocks? Not sure. Maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, the key is that each example's material is a type that the method is specifically designed for. Cosmogenic is for exposure, not the material's age. So it's a different purpose. Hence, not a perfect match. So maybe 7.

Hmm. Let me try another angle. The anti-examples are obsidian hydration (non-radiometric), amino acid (non-radiometric), and ESR (radiometric but maybe used on different materials). So the theme is radiometric methods paired with their specific materials. So any radiometric method paired with the right material gets a high score. Cosmogenic is radiometric and paired with surface rocks, so 10. Radiocarbon with organic, 10. The others are non-radiometric, so 0-2.

Candidate 4: 10.

Candidate 3:10.

Candidate 6: stratigraphic layering is a relative dating method, so 0.

Candidate 8: ice core sampling. If the method here is, say, counting layers, then 0. If it's using radiocarbon on the organic material in the ice, but the candidate just says "ice core sampling" generally, so it's not specified as radiometric. So 0.

Candidate 5: varve is non-radiometric, 0.

Candidate 7: same as 2, 0.

Candidate 1: archaeomagnetic, non-radiometric. So maybe 1.

So the scores would be:

1.0

Wait no, candidate 1 is archaeomagnetic, which is a dating method but non-radiometric. So like the anti-examples which include non-radiometric, so it should be low. Let's see, the anti-examples have scores that are 0, but the user says anti-examples are not examples of the exact theme but could be part of a broader one. So the task is to score how well they match the exact theme. Since the exact theme is radiometric plus material, then any non-radiometric is 0. So:

1. archaeomagnetic: 0

2. dendro:0

3. radiocarbon:10

4. cosmogenic:10

5. varve:0

6. stratigraphic:0

7. tree ring:0

8. ice core:0

But the user said to use the full range. Maybe some are in between? Like maybe some are 5 or 6? Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait candidate 6 is stratigraphic layering, which is a relative dating method, so 0. Candidate 8: ice core sampling might involve some radiometric methods, but the primary is not. Since it's not specified, it's 0.

Hmm. Maybe the only ones that get high scores are 3 and 4, the rest are 0. But the user wants the full range. Maybe I need to consider other aspects.

Wait, maybe the theme is more specific than just radiometric paired with material. Let me think again. The examples are:

- Thermoluminescence (trapped charge) on ceramics (fired materials)

- Potassium-argon (isotopic decay) on volcanic rocks (contain K)

- Uranium-thorium (isotopic decay) on coral (which absorb U from water)

So each method is specifically suited to the material's properties. For example, thermoluminescence requires heating, so it's for ceramics that were fired. Potassium-argon needs K-rich minerals in volcanic rocks. Uranium-thorium needs U uptake in corals.

So the theme is radiometric dating methods that are specifically applicable due to the material's composition or formation process.

Candidate 3: radiocarbon on organic materials. Yes, because organic materials have carbon, so that's a good fit. 10.

Candidate 4: cosmogenic nuclides on surface rocks. The rocks must be exposed to cosmic rays, so it's for materials that have been at the surface. The method relies on the material's exposure, so it's a good pairing. 10.

Candidate 6: stratigraphic layering is a relative dating method based on superposition, not radiometric. So 0.

Candidate 5: varve is annual layers, non-radiometric. 0.

Candidate 7: same as 2, 0.

Candidate 8: ice cores' dating is via layer counting (non-radiometric) unless they use radiocarbon on trapped air or something, but the candidate doesn't specify. So 0.

Candidate 1: archaeomagnetic is based on Earth's magnetic field changes, non-radiometric. 0.

So the scores would be:

1.0

2.0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants a granular scale, using numbers like 3,4, etc. Maybe I'm missing some nuances.

Wait, maybe some candidates are partially related. For example, stratigraphic layering (6) is a relative dating method, but maybe in archaeology it's used with other methods. But no, the theme is about the specific pairing of radiometric and material. So still 0.

Alternatively, maybe "stratigraphic layering" is a category that includes some radiometric methods? Unlikely. It's a separate method.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that cosmogenic nuclide is a bit different because it's exposure dating, not formation age. So maybe it's 8 instead of 10.

Radiocarbon is spot on, so 10.

Candidate 4: 8.

Candidate 3:10.

Others 0 except maybe some:

Wait candidate 8: ice core sampling could involve radiometric methods like radiocarbon on trapped organic material, but the candidate doesn't specify. Since it's just "ice core sampling", which is general, it's not. So 0.

Candidate 6: stratigraphy is 0.

Candidate 1: archaeomagnetic 0.

Candidate 2: dendro 0.

Candidate 5: varve 0.

Candidate 7: tree ring 0.

So only 3 and 4 get high scores, others 0. But the user wants the full range. Maybe I made a mistake in considering cosmogenic as a perfect match. Let me see:

Original examples:

- Each method is used to date the material's formation age (ceramics fired, volcanic rock cooled, coral formed).

Cosmogenic dates the exposure time, not the material's formation. So it's a different purpose. Hence, it's not a perfect match. So maybe 7.

Radiocarbon is perfect (10), cosmogenic is 7.

Candidate 4:7.

Candidate 3:10.

Then the rest are 0 except maybe some others?

Candidate 8: ice core sampling might use radiometric methods in some cases, but not primarily. So 0.

Candidate 6: stratigraphy 0.

Candidate 5: varve 0.

Candidate 1:0.

Candidate 2:0.

Candidate 7:0.

So the scores would be:

1.0

2.0

3.10

4.7

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

That uses some of the scale. Maybe candidate 4 is 8 instead of 7. Let me think again. The exposure dating is still a form of radiometric dating, just a different application. Since the theme is the pairing of method and material, regardless of the purpose, then it's a good match. Hence 10.

Alternatively, since the examples are all about the material's age, and cosmogenic is about exposure, it's a different theme aspect. So 7.

Hmm. I think I'll go with 10 for 3 and 4, others 0 except maybe one more.

Wait candidate 8: ice core sampling can involve radiocarbon dating of the trapped air or organic matter. But the candidate says "ice core sampling" generally, not specifying. So unless it's paired with a specific method, it's not. So 0.

Alternatively, maybe "ice core sampling" is considered a material, and if there's a dating method for it. But the standard dating is layer counting. So no.

Alternatively, maybe the candidate 8 is 0.

So final scores:

1.0

2.0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants the full range. Maybe I need to find some in between.

Wait candidate 6: stratigraphic layering is a relative method, but maybe in some contexts paired with absolute methods? But the theme is about the specific pairing. So no.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake with candidate 4. Let me see examples again. The examples are all isotopic decay methods except thermoluminescence (which is trapped charge). Cosmogenic is also isotopic but from cosmic rays, so it's a different type. But the key is that it's radiometric and paired with a specific material. So 10.

Alternatively, maybe the anti-example includes ESR, which is a radiometric method but used on materials not in the examples, so the theme requires the specific materials from the examples. But the examples' materials are ceramics, volcanic rocks, coral reefs. The anti-examples include obsidian (a volcanic glass, a type of volcanic rock?), but obsidian hydration is non-radiometric. So maybe the theme is radiometric methods applied to the specific materials listed. If that's the case, then only methods applied to those exact materials would score high. But the candidates don't have any of those materials except maybe volcanic rocks for cosmogenic? No.

Wait, the theme is inferred from the examples, which are three different materials with their specific radiometric methods. So the theme is "radiometric dating techniques applied to their respective optimal materials", not limited to those exact materials. So any such pairing is acceptable.

Therefore, cosmogenic on surface rocks is a valid example, so 10.

Thus, the scores are as above. Since the user wants a granular scale, perhaps I should give some candidates lower scores than 10 but above 0.

Wait candidate 3 is radiocarbon on organic. The original examples have coral reefs (organic) with uranium-thorium. So radiocarbon is another radiometric method on organic. Since coral is a type of organic, but the method is different. However, the theme allows for different materials as long as the method is paired with its material. So radiocarbon is a perfect example. So 10.

Candidate 4:10.

The rest are non-radiometric, so 0.

Alternatively, maybe stratigraphic layering (6) is a form of relative dating but sometimes combined with radiometric, but no. The question is about the candidate itself. So it's 0.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that some candidates are partially related. For example, varve chronology (5) is annual layers, which is time-based but non-radiometric. So 0.

Alright, I'll proceed with the scores as follows, ensuring some variation:

Wait, perhaps candidate 8 (ice core sampling) could be 2 because ice cores can have some radiometric elements but not primary. So maybe 2.

Candidate 4:10

Candidate3:10

Candidate1:1

Candidate8:1

Others 0.

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Let me think of each candidate:

1. Archaeomagnetic dating: Non-radiometric, so 0 or 1.

2. Dendrochronology:0

3. Radiocarbon:10

4. Cosmogenic:10

5. Varve:0

6. Stratigraphic:0

7. Tree ring:0

8. Ice core:0 or 1 (if considering any minor use of radiometric)

Alternatively:

1.0

2.0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But to use the full range, maybe some are 5 or 3.

Wait perhaps candidate 6: stratigraphic layering is a relative method, but maybe in the context of archaeology, it's paired with other methods? No, the question is about the candidate itself. So still 0.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that some methods are related but not exact. For example, varve chronology (5) is similar to dendro in being annual layers, so 0.

Alternatively, maybe archaeomagnetic is a bit more related than others, so 1.

So final scores:

1.0

2.0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants a more varied score. Maybe I missed something.

Wait candidate 6: stratigraphic layering in archaeology. Maybe stratigraphy can be combined with radiometric dates, but the method itself is not. So 0.

Alternatively, maybe the theme includes any dating method with a specific material, but radiometric is the key. So non-radiometric get 0.

Alternatively, maybe "stratigraphic layering" is a category that includes some radiometric? No.

Hmm. I'll proceed with the above, but to meet the requirement of using the full range, maybe:

1. Archaeomagnetic: 1

2. Dendro:0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.1 (for ice cores possibly using some radiometric methods occasionally)

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe candidate 4 is 9 instead of 10.

Alternatively, give some candidates like candidate 5 a 2 because it's a time-based method but not radiometric. But I think it's better to stick with 0 for non-radiometric.

Alright, I'll go with the following scores to ensure some variation where possible:

1. archaeomagnetic: 1

2. dendro:0

3. radiocarbon:10

4. cosmogenic:9

5. varve:0

6. stratigraphic:0

7. tree ring:0

8. ice core:1

This uses some scores like 1, 9, 10, etc. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe candidate 4 is 10, others are 0 except 1 and 8 as 1. So:

1.1

2.0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.1

This uses 0,1,10,10.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 6: stratigraphic layering is a broader method, so 2?

No, it's a relative method, so 0.

Hmm. I think I'll proceed with the initial thought where only 3 and 4 get 10 and 0 for others except 1 and 8 as 1. That uses 0,1,10. But the user wants the full range. Maybe I need to find another angle.

Wait, the anti-examples include ESR dating, which is radiometric but applied to different materials (like teeth). So maybe candidate 8 (ice core) could be a radiometric method if using cosmogenic in ice? No, cosmogenic is for surface rocks. Ice cores use other methods. Maybe radiocarbon on trapped CO2? So if ice core sampling includes radiocarbon, then it's a 10? But the candidate says "ice core sampling" without specifying, so it's ambiguous. Maybe a 5.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 3.

Alternatively, I'm overcomplicating. Given the examples and anti-examples, the best matches are 3 and 4 with 10. The rest are non-radiometric, so 0. But to use the scale, maybe:

1.0

2.0

3.10

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants the full range. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering cosmogenic as a perfect match. Let's say it's 8 instead of 10.

Candidate 4:8

Candidate3:10

The rest:

1.0

2.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

Then the scores use 0,8,10.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 5 (varve) is 2 because it's time-based but not radiometric.

Candidate 1:1

Candidate8:1

Thus:

1.1

2.0

3.10

4.8

5.2

6.0

7.0

8.1

This uses 0,1,2,8,10.

This uses more of the scale.

Alternatively, here's a possible breakdown:

1. Archaeomagnetic: 1 (non-radiometric)

2. Dendrochronology:0 (non-radiometric)

3. Radiocarbon:10 (perfect match)

4. Cosmogenic:9 (radiometric but exposure dating)

5. Varve:0 (non-radiometric)

6. Stratigraphic:0 (relative)

7. Tree ring:0

8. Ice core:1 (if any minor radiometric use)

This uses 0,1,9,10.

Alternatively:

4. Cosmogenic:10 (since it's radiometric and specific material)

Thus, the final answer would be:

<number>1</number><score>1</score>

<number>2</number><score>0</score>

<number>3</number><score>10</score>

<number>4</number><score>10</score>
