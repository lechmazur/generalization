Okay, I need to figure out how to score each candidate based on the specific theme from the examples provided. Let me start by understanding what the theme is exactly. The examples given are all works where the ending or conclusion presents a tension between determinism (predetermined fate) and free will. The key here is that the ambiguity or unresolved question between these two concepts is central to the ending, leaving the reader to question which is at play.

The anti-examples are deterministic views that are more straightforward. For instance, Skinner's behaviorism is a deterministic view without the ambiguity or the narrative tension between the two. Similarly, Newton's physics is a deterministic system but not in a narrative context exploring human choices versus fate. Brave New World's social conditioning is deterministic but again, not presenting that specific tension in an ambiguous ending.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Freud's psychoanalytic theory's deterministic view of human behavior. Freud's theories do suggest that behavior is determined by unconscious forces, which is deterministic. However, this is a theoretical framework, not a narrative with an ambiguous ending that leaves the reader questioning the balance. So this is more like an anti-example. Score low, maybe 2?

2. Philip K. Dick's "Ubik" has an unresolved conclusion with shifting realities. The ending leaves the reader unsure about reality and whether actions were fated or choices. This seems similar to the examples given (like The Stranger or No Exit). The ambiguity between destiny and agency is present here. So this should be a high score, maybe 8 or 9?

3. Norse mythology's Norns determining destiny. This is a clear example of fate being predetermined by supernatural forces. There's no ambiguity here; it's more of a strict determinism. The examples in the original theme have endings where the tension is unresolved, but Norse myth's concept is a straightforward fate, so this is closer to an anti-example. Maybe a 3?

4. Greek mythology's fate, like the Moirai or gods dictating destinies. Similar to Norse, but maybe even more famous (like Oedipus Rex). However, in Oedipus Rex (which is candidate 8), there's a clear tragic resolution showing fate's inevitability. But the question here is about the concept in general. Since Greek mythology's fate is often presented as inescapable, but sometimes characters try to defy it. However, the anti-examples include similar deterministic views (like Brave New World's social conditioning). But the original examples have the tension in the narrative's ending. So maybe a 4?

Wait, candidate 8 is specifically Oedipus Rex, which is a play. Let me hold on to that.

5. St. Augustine's predestination. Theological predestination is a deterministic view where God has already decided salvation. This is more like an anti-example because it's a clear theological stance without the narrative ambiguity. So low score, maybe 1?

6. John Calvin's predestination. Same as Augustine, part of theological determinism. So similar to 5, maybe 1 or 2.

7. 1984's deterministic world where free will is suppressed. The party controls everything, so it's a deterministic society, but the theme is more about oppression and lack of free will. The ending isn't ambiguous; it's a clear suppression. So this is like the anti-examples (Brave New World's social conditioning), so maybe 2?

8. Oedipus Rex's fate vs free will. The play's resolution is tragic because despite his efforts, Oedipus fulfills his fate. The ending is a clear demonstration of fate's power over free will. The original examples have endings that leave the question open, but Oedipus's ending is more conclusive. So maybe a 5 or 6? Because there is an exploration, but the conclusion is more definitive.

Wait, the examples given (Camus, Sartre, Dostoevsky) have endings that don't resolve the tension between determinism and free will. The anti-examples are deterministic systems without that ambiguity. So Oedipus Rex does present the conflict but resolves it in favor of fate. The theme here is about the unresolved tension, so Oedipus might not fit as well as something like "Ubik" which leaves it open. So maybe Oedipus gets a lower score, like 4 or 5.

Let me reassess each candidate again systematically:

1. Freud's theory: deterministic but theoretical, not a narrative with ambiguous ending. Anti-example type. Score 1 or 2.

2. Ubik: ambiguous ending, shifting realities, balance between destiny and agency. Matches the examples. High score, maybe 9?

3. Norse Norns: strict fate, no ambiguity. Anti-example. 1-3.

4. Greek fate: similar to Norse but perhaps in some contexts there's tension. But in general, their myths often show unavoidable fate. So maybe 2-4. Since the question is about the concept in Greek mythology, which is deterministic, so 3.

5. Augustine's predestination: theological determinism, no ambiguity. 1.

6. Calvin's predestination: same as 5. 1.

7. 1984: deterministic society, but the theme is about control and lack of free will. The ending is not ambiguous; the protagonist is defeated. So it's more like an anti-example. 2.

8. Oedipus Rex: the play's resolution shows fate's triumph. The ending is a clear tragic conclusion where free will is overwhelmed by fate. The original examples have unresolved tension. So maybe 5? Since it's exploring the theme but resolves it, so not as good a fit as Ubik.

Wait, the original examples have endings that leave the question open. Oedipus's ending is definitive (fate wins), so it's less ambiguous. So maybe a 4 or 5. 

Putting it all together:

1. Freud: 2

2. Ubik: 9

3. Norse: 2

4. Greek: 3

5. Augustine: 1

6. Calvin: 1

7. 1984: 2

8. Oedipus: 4

Wait, but let me check again. For example, the examples given (Camus, Sartre, Dostoevsky) all have endings where the reader is left questioning whether it's determinism or free will. The key is the unresolved tension in the narrative's ending. 

Oedipus Rex's ending is a tragic confirmation that fate is inescapable. The protagonist's attempts to avoid his fate lead him to fulfill it. The ending is conclusive in favor of fate, not leaving it ambiguous. Therefore, it doesn't fit the specific theme as well as Ubik. So Oedipus would be lower, maybe 4.

Similarly, Norse and Greek fate are straightforward determinism, so low scores. 

Freud's theory is a deterministic view but not in a narrative context, so 2. 

1984's world is deterministic, but the ending is not about the ambiguity between the two, so 2.

Calvin and Augustine are theological determinism, so 1 each.

So the scores would be:

1. 2

2. 9

3. 2

4. 3

5. 1

6. 1

7. 2

8. 4

Wait, but maybe Oedipus's exploration of fate vs free will is closer. The play does present the conflict, even if the ending resolves it in favor of fate. The examples have endings that don't resolve it, but maybe the fact that it's exploring the theme is enough? The question says "the specific theme identified from the examples". The examples' key point is the unresolved ending creating the tension. So Oedipus's resolution might not fit as well. So 4 is reasonable.

Alternatively, if the theme is the tension between the two concepts regardless of resolution, maybe it's higher. But the examples all have endings that leave the question open. So Oedipus's clear resolution makes it a worse fit. Hence, 4 is okay.

So final scores as per above.
