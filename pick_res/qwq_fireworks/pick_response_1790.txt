Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples provided are "deafening silence," "jumbo shrimp," and "bittersweet chocolate." 

Hmm, each of these phrases combines two words that seem contradictory or paradoxical. "Deafening" usually means very loud, but "silence" is the absence of sound. "Jumbo" implies large, while "shrimp" are small creatures. "Bittersweet" is a mix of bitter and sweet tastes, but "chocolate" can have those flavors. So the theme here seems to be oxymoronic pairs where the two words contradict each other in a meaningful way.

Now, looking at the anti-examples: "yin and yang," "fire and ice," "life and death." These are classic opposing pairs but not necessarily oxymorons. They represent complementary opposites that coexist, like forces in balance. So the key difference is that the specific theme requires a single phrase that combines contradictory elements, whereas the anti-examples are pairs of separate concepts that are opposites but not inherently contradictory within a single term or concept.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Good versus evil**: This is a classic opposition, similar to the anti-examples. They are opposing forces but not a single phrase with inherent contradiction. So probably a lower score.

2. **Heaven and hell**: Again, two separate places, opposites but not a single contradictory term. So similar to anti-examples. Lower score.

3. **Positive and negative**: These are opposites but again separate terms. Not an oxymoron. Low score.

4. **Sweet and sour**: This is a combination of two contrasting flavors, often used together in cuisine. This seems like an oxymoron because it's a single concept combining opposites. Maybe a high score here.

5. **Black and white**: These are opposites, but usually used as a pair (like in black and white photos) but not inherently contradictory in the same way as the examples. Maybe a middle score?

6. **Living dead**: This is a classic oxymoron. "Living" and "dead" are contradictions in one term. High score.

7. **Love and hate**: Opposite emotions, but again separate concepts. Not a single phrase with internal contradiction. Lower score.

8. **Light and dark**: Opposing concepts but separate, like the anti-examples. Lower score.

Wait, let me recheck. The examples are phrases where two contradictory words are combined into a single concept. So "living dead" is exactly that. "Sweet and sour" is a combination used as a single term (like a sauce), so that's good. "Black and white" can be a single term for things like photos, but maybe not as contradictory as the examples. "Positive and negative" could be in a single context (like charges), but not as oxymoronic. 

Comparing all, the best matches would be 4 (sweet and sour) and 6 (living dead). The next ones might be in the middle. Let's assign scores:

1. Good vs evil: 2 (since it's a common opposition but not an oxymoron)
2. Heaven and hell: 1 (same as above)
3. Positive and negative: 2
4. Sweet and sour: 8 (strong oxymoron used together)
5. Black and white: 3 (sometimes used as a single term but less contradictory)
6. Living dead: 10 (perfect oxymoron)
7. Love and hate: 1 (separate opposites)
8. Light and dark: 2 (similar to anti-examples)

Wait, but the user said not to use 10s or 0s unless necessary. The examples given by the user had "jumbo shrimp" as an example. Let me see the original examples again. The user's examples are "deafening silence", "jumbo shrimp", "bittersweet chocolate". So "bittersweet" is an adjective combining two tastes, but "chocolate" is the noun. "Jumbo shrimp" combines a size with a small creature. So maybe "sweet and sour" is exactly like that, combining two taste adjectives, so maybe 10? But the original examples have the structure of adjective + noun or adjective + adjective + noun. Wait, "bittersweet chocolate" is adjective + noun, "jumbo shrimp" is adjective + noun. "Deafening silence" is adjective + noun. So the structure is adjective + noun where the adjective seems contradictory to the noun. 

In that case, "sweet and sour" is two adjectives, but not modifying a noun here. The candidates are all pairs connected with "and" or "versus". The original examples are noun phrases with a modifying adjective that's contradictory. The anti-examples are pairs of nouns or abstract concepts. 

So maybe "living dead" is adjective + noun (living is an adjective, dead is a noun? Wait, "dead" is an adjective here. "Living dead" is two adjectives modifying an implied noun? Hmm, maybe the structure is different. "Living dead" is a noun phrase where "living" and "dead" are both adjectives describing the noun (people). But the original examples have an adjective that's contradictory to the noun. So "jumbo shrimp" is an adjective (big) modifying shrimp (small). So the key is the adjective contradicting the noun. 

Looking at the candidates again: 

"Sweet and sour" is two adjectives, not an adjective-noun pair. So maybe that's less of a match. 

"Living dead" is two adjectives modifying a noun (the dead are already dead, so "living dead" is a contradiction). That's similar to the examples. 

"Black and white" as adjectives, but again not an adjective-noun pair. 

So perhaps the best matches are those that are adjective-noun pairs with contradiction. 

Looking at the candidates again, none are in the exact structure except maybe "living dead" (if "dead" is the noun and "living" the adjective?), but "dead" is an adjective here. Alternatively, "living dead" is a noun phrase where both adjectives contradict each other. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is simply combining contradictory terms in a phrase, regardless of structure. 

In that case, "living dead" is a strong oxymoron (10). "Sweet and sour" is a combination of two opposites, but used together as a descriptor (maybe 8). 

"Positive and negative" are opposites but not in a contradictory phrase. 

"Love and hate" are opposites but not combined in a single term. 

So the scores would be:

1. Good vs evil: 2 (opposites but not a single contradictory phrase)
2. Heaven and hell: 1
3. Positive and negative: 2
4. Sweet and sour: 8 (combines opposites in a term)
5. Black and white: 3
6. Living dead: 10
7. Love and hate: 1
8. Light and dark: 2

But the user said not to use 10s unless necessary. Wait, the original examples have "jumbo shrimp" which is a classic oxymoron, so "living dead" is equally good. Maybe 10 is okay here. But perhaps the user wants to avoid extremes. Let me see the anti-examples: they are pairs of nouns, so the specific theme is more about the structure of a single phrase with contradictory elements. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "oxymorons" where two contradictory words are used together. In that case, "living dead" is a classic oxymoron (10). "Sweet and sour" is an oxymoron but it's a combination of two adjectives, which is still an oxymoron (maybe 9). 

But "deafening silence" is an oxymoron, "jumbo shrimp" is another, "bittersweet chocolate" (bittersweet is an adjective). So all examples are oxymorons. Therefore, the task is to score candidates based on how much they are oxymorons. 

So:

1. Good vs evil: Not an oxymoron, just opposing concepts. 1-2.

2. Heaven and hell: Same. 1.

3. Positive and negative: Opposites, but not an oxymoron. 2.

4. Sweet and sour: Yes, an oxymoron. 9.

5. Black and white: They are opposites but not an oxymoron. 3.

6. Living dead: Perfect oxymoron. 10.

7. Love and hate: Opposites, not oxymoron. 1.

8. Light and dark: Opposites, not oxymoron. 2.

But the user's anti-examples include "yin and yang" which are opposites but not oxymorons, so the specific theme is oxymorons. Therefore, the scores should reflect how much the candidate is an oxymoron. 

So final scores:

1. 2

2. 1

3. 2

4. 9

5. 3

6. 10

7. 1

8. 2

Wait but the user said not to use 10 unless it's a perfect match. Since the original examples are all oxymorons, and "living dead" is a textbook example, it's a 10. "Sweet and sour" is also a common oxymoron (like a dish), so 9? Or maybe 8? Let me think. "Bittersweet" is an adjective, so "sweet and sour" is similar. Maybe 9. 

Alternatively, "sweet and sour" is a combination of two adjectives used together, which is an oxymoron. So maybe 9. 

The user's examples have "bittersweet chocolate" which combines an adjective (bittersweet) with a noun, so "sweet and sour" is two adjectives but still an oxymoron. 

Alright, proceeding with those scores.
