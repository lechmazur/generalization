Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user gave three examples: a toothbrush, a wrench, and a glove. The anti-examples are space debris, space station, and space probe. So I need to find the specific theme that the first three share but that the anti-examples don't fit.

Hmm, toothbrush, wrench, and glove are all everyday items, right? Theyâ€™re personal or household objects. But wait, the anti-examples are all related to space. So maybe the theme is not about space, but maybe something else that the first three have in common but the anti-examples don't. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is items that are used on Earth in daily life, as opposed to space-related objects. The anti-examples are all in space, but the examples are earthbound tools. That could be it. So the specific theme is "everyday objects used on Earth, not specifically designed for space." 

Now looking at the candidates:

1. A camera: Cameras can be everyday items, like a regular camera someone uses. But also used in space. But the anti-examples are space-related, so maybe a regular camera would fit the theme. So maybe a 7 or 8? But wait, maybe not. Let me see.

2. A space capsule: That's definitely space-related, so it's an anti-example. So score 0 or 1.

3. A satellite: Definitely space-related, so 0.

4. A rocket: Also space, so 0.

5. A space suit: Space-related, so 0.

6. A space shuttle: Space, so 0.

7. A solar panel: Can be used on Earth, like for energy. So maybe a 7 or 8. But maybe it's more of a technological item. Hmm.

8. A lunar rover: Lunar rover is for the moon, so space-related. 0.

Wait, but maybe the theme is "items that are personal belongings or tools used in daily life." So a camera could be a personal item. A solar panel is more of an installation. A toothbrush is personal, wrench is a tool, glove is clothing. So maybe the theme is personal or handheld tools/equipment. Then:

Camera: handheld, yes. Maybe 8?

Solar panel: not handheld, more a structure. Maybe 4?

Wait, but the examples include a glove, which is clothing. So maybe the theme is items that are worn or held by a person in daily life. Then space suit would be worn, but it's an anti-example. So the theme is items that are worn or used in daily life on Earth, not in space. So space-related items are out.

So let's go through each candidate again:

1. Camera: Can be a personal item, yes. So high score, maybe 8 or 9?

2. Space capsule: 0.

3. Satellite: 0.

4. Rocket: 0.

5. Space suit: 0.

6. Space shuttle: 0.

7. Solar panel: Maybe used on Earth, but not personal. Maybe 5?

8. Lunar rover: 0.

Wait, but the anti-examples include space debris, space station, space probe. So the theme must exclude space-related things. So any candidate related to space gets 0. So numbers 2-6 and 8 are 0. 

Now for the others:

1. Camera: If it's a regular camera, yes. Maybe 8 or 9.

7. Solar panel: Used on Earth, but maybe not a personal item. Maybe 5?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "items that can be held in one hand" or something. Let me re-examine the examples:

Toothbrush, wrench (small one?), glove. All can be held. But a wrench could be big. Maybe not. Alternatively, items that are used for a specific function. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "items that are part of a set of tools or personal items that are common in a household or toolkit." So a camera might not be in everyone's toolkit, but maybe common enough. A solar panel is more of a component. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all things that are singular items, not part of a larger system. The anti-examples are parts of a space system. Hmm.

Alternatively, the examples are all items that a person uses directly, like a toothbrush for hygiene, wrench for fixing things, glove for wearing. So the theme is personal-use items that a person uses directly. Then:

Camera: yes, so 8.

Solar panel: Not something you directly use, so maybe 3.

Wait, solar panel provides energy but isn't directly used by a person. So maybe 2.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think of another angle. The anti-examples are all in space, so the theme is items not related to space. But then why are the examples not including space? The user said the anti-examples can match a broader theme, but the specific theme is different. So the specific theme is something that the examples share but the anti-examples don't, even if the anti-examples share a broader theme.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all items that are used on a person's body or in close proximity, like a toothbrush (mouth), wrench (hand), glove (hand). So maybe items that are worn or held. Then:

Camera: held, so yes. Maybe 8.

Solar panel: not worn or held, so 3.

Lunar rover is a vehicle, so 0.

Space suit is worn but part of space, so anti-example.

Hmm, that might be a better angle. So the theme could be "items worn or held by a person in daily life on Earth." Then:

1. Camera: held, yes. 8.

7. Solar panel: not, so 2.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "items that are singular objects, not part of a larger system." But space debris is part of a system, but maybe not. Not sure.

Alternatively, the examples are all things that are not part of a vehicle or a large structure. The anti-examples are parts of space vehicles or stations. So the theme is "items not part of a vehicle or large structure, used on Earth." Then:

Camera: yes, so 8.

Solar panel: maybe part of a system but standalone, so 5?

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try another approach. The examples are toothbrush, wrench, glove. All are tools or personal items used on Earth. The anti-examples are all space-related. So the specific theme is "items used on Earth in daily life, not in space." Thus, any space-related item is out (0). Non-space items get higher scores.

So candidates:

1. Camera: Earth, yes. Maybe 8.

2. Space capsule: 0.

3. Satellite: 0.

4. Rocket: 0.

5. Space suit: 0.

6. Space shuttle:0.

7. Solar panel: Earth use, but maybe more industrial. Maybe 6.

8. Lunar rover: space, 0.

Wait, but solar panel can be on Earth for energy. So maybe 7?

Alternatively, maybe some items are more personal. A camera is personal. Solar panel is more infrastructure. So camera 9, solar panel 5.

Hmm. Alternatively, the examples are all things that a person uses directly in their daily routine. So a camera might be part of someone's routine (like a photographer), but not everyone. Solar panel is not. So maybe:

Camera: 7.

Solar panel: 3.

Alternatively, the examples are all portable. A wrench is portable, toothbrush, glove. So:

Camera: portable, so 8.

Solar panel: not portable, so 2.

Lunar rover is a vehicle, so not portable (but it is a vehicle, so space-related anyway).

Okay, going with this:

1. Camera: 8

2. 0

3. 0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7. Solar panel: maybe 5 because it's used on Earth but not as a personal item.

8.0

Wait, but solar panel could be considered as part of a system. Maybe 4.

Alternatively, maybe 6. Let me think again. The examples include a tool (wrench), a hygiene item (toothbrush), and clothing (glove). So the theme could be items that are either tools, clothing, or personal hygiene. Then:

Camera: tool? Maybe, so 7.

Solar panel: not, so 3.

Alternatively, the theme is "items that are used in manual labor or personal care." Then camera is less so. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all items that are commonly found in a house or garage. A camera might be, so 7. Solar panel is less common in a house (though some have them), so 5.

Hmm. Maybe I should assign scores based on how closely they resemble the examples in being everyday objects not related to space. So:

1. Camera: 8 (everyday, not space)

2. 0

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7. Solar panel: 5 (used on Earth but more specialized)

8.0

That seems reasonable. Let me check again.

The user wants the scores to be granular, so not all 0s except a few. For the non-space items (camera and solar panel):

Camera is a common object, so higher. Solar panel is also on Earth but maybe less of a personal item. So 8 and 5. The others are space-related, so 0.

So final scores would be:

1.8, 2.0, 3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.5,8.0.
