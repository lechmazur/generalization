Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided three examples: theatrical spirit gum, rosin powder, and liquid latex. The anti-examples are theater mask, ballet shoes, and fog machine. The task is to figure out the specific theme these examples share and then score each candidate based on how well they fit that exact theme, avoiding the broader or related themes that the anti-examples might represent.

First, I need to determine the common theme among the examples. Let's look at each example:

1. **Theatrical spirit gum**: This is used to adhere prosthetics or fake hair to the skin in theater.
2. **Rosin powder**: Used by musicians (like violinists) and sometimes in theater for grip, maybe for shoes on stages?
3. **Liquid latex**: Used for creating wounds, scars, or other effects on the skin in makeup.

Hmm, all three are materials used specifically in theatrical makeup or special effects. They are products applied to the body or used in creating physical effects for performances. 

Now the anti-examples:

1. **Theater mask**: While related to theater, it's a prop or part of a costume rather than a material used in applying effects.
2. **Ballet shoes**: These are part of costumes or performance attire, not materials used in makeup or effects.
3. **Fog machine**: This is a stage effect device, part of the technical aspects of a performance but not a material applied directly to the body or for makeup.

So the specific theme seems to be **materials or products specifically used in applying theatrical makeup or special effects directly to the body or props for the purpose of altering appearance temporarily**. 

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Prop sword**: A prop, but it's a physical object, not a material used for makeup or effects applied to the body. It's more of a set prop. So probably low score, maybe 2-3.

2. **Microphone**: A sound device. Not related to makeup or effects on the body. 0 or 1.

3. **Spotlight**: Lighting equipment. Again, technical aspect but not a material for makeup. Maybe 1-2.

4. **Lighting board**: Controls lights. Definitely not in the theme. 0.

5. **Stage makeup**: This is directly related. Stage makeup products like greasepaint, which are materials applied. But wait, the examples are specific products (spirit gum, rosin, latex). Stage makeup is a broader category. Wait, but the question says the examples are part of the specific theme. So maybe stage makeup is a direct match. But let me check. The examples are specific products used in makeup effects. Stage makeup itself is the application, but the materials used would be part of it. Hmm, maybe 8 or 9? Or is it too broad? The examples are all specific products, so maybe stage makeup is the category, but the examples are items within that. So stage makeup products would fit. So maybe 9? Wait, but "stage makeup" is the general term, not a specific product. The examples are specific items. So maybe 7? Because it's related but not as specific as the examples. Hmm.

6. **Sound mixer**: Technical audio equipment. Not related. 0.

7. **Costume jewelry**: Part of costumes, not makeup or effects applied to the body. Maybe 1-2. Unless it's part of a character's look, but it's not a material used in makeup application. So lower score.

8. **Theater curtain**: Part of the set design. Not related to makeup materials. 0 or 1.

Wait, let me reassess each candidate again carefully.

1. Prop sword: Definitely a prop, not a material for makeup or effects. 0-2. Maybe 2 because it's theater-related but not the theme.

2. Microphone: Sound, so 0.

3. Spotlight: Lighting, so 0-1.

4. Lighting board: 0.

5. Stage makeup: The examples are materials used in stage makeup. So stage makeup itself is the application, but the products (like spirit gum) are part of it. So if the theme is "materials used in stage makeup/special effects," then "stage makeup" as a category might be too broad, but the question says the examples are part of the specific theme. Maybe stage makeup products are included. So if "stage makeup" refers to the products, then it's a 10? But the examples are specific products. Alternatively, maybe "stage makeup" is the category, and the examples are items within. The user wants to match the specific theme, so if the theme is "specific materials used in theatrical makeup/sfx," then "stage makeup" as a general term might be a 7 or 8, but not a perfect 10. Hmm. Maybe 8? Because it's part of the same category but more general. Wait, but the user says the anti-examples are part of broader themes. The examples are specific items. So "stage makeup" might be a better fit than the anti-examples. Let me think again. The examples are specific products (spirit gum, rosin, latex) used in applying effects. So stage makeup as a product (like the makeup itself) would be a direct match, but "stage makeup" is the general term. Wait, perhaps "stage makeup" is the category, but the examples are items within that category. So the theme is "materials used in theatrical makeup and effects." So stage makeup (products) would be a 10? But maybe not. Let me see: if the examples are specific products (spirit gum, rosin, latex), then "stage makeup" as a category would be broader. But perhaps "stage makeup" is a product line, so maybe 9? Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "materials used in creating theatrical prosthetics or special effects on the body." In that case, stage makeup is part of that, but again, it's a broader term. Maybe 8? Let's tentatively put 8.

6. Sound mixer: 0.

7. Costume jewelry: Part of costume, not makeup or body effects. 1.

8. Theater curtain: 0.

Wait, but looking at the anti-examples: theater mask is a prop but not a material. So theater curtain is a set piece, so 0. Costume jewelry is part of costume, so 0-1.

Wait, but the anti-examples include theater mask (a prop) and ballet shoes (costume), so those are excluded. So costume jewelry would be similar to ballet shoes, so maybe 0 or 1. 

Let me recheck all:

1. Prop sword: 2 (theater prop but not the materials)
2. Microphone: 0 (sound)
3. Spotlight: 1 (lighting)
4. Lighting board: 0
5. Stage makeup: 9 (since it's directly related to the application materials)
6. Sound mixer: 0
7. Costume jewelry: 1 (costume accessory, not makeup)
8. Theater curtain: 0

Wait, but the examples include rosin powder, which might be used for grip on shoes. But the anti-example is ballet shoes. So rosin is a material used on shoes, but ballet shoes themselves are excluded. So costume jewelry would be similar to ballet shoes (both costume parts) so lower. Maybe 1.

Alternatively, maybe rosin is a material applied to shoes, so it's part of the theme. But the ballet shoes themselves are not. So costume jewelry is part of costume, so not in theme. So 0 or 1.

Hmm. I think I need to make sure each is scored between 0-10 with nuance. Let me try to assign numbers:

1. Prop sword: 2 (related to theater but not materials for makeup/effects)
2. Microphone: 0 (sound equipment)
3. Spotlight: 1 (lighting, part of technical but not the theme)
4. Lighting board: 0
5. Stage makeup: 8 (closer but still a category, not specific product like examples, but better than anti-examples)
6. Sound mixer: 0
7. Costume jewelry: 1 (closer to ballet shoes, which are anti-examples, but maybe slightly more related to appearance? Not sure. Maybe 1)
8. Theater curtain: 0

Wait, but maybe stage makeup is a 9? If the examples are specific products (spirit gum, rosin, latex), then stage makeup as a category would be 7? Hmm. Alternatively, since the examples are all materials used in makeup or effects, stage makeup products are exactly that. So if "stage makeup" refers to the actual makeup products (like greasepaint), then it's a 10? But the user might consider it too broad. The user's examples are specific items (spirit gum is a specific product), so "stage makeup" might be a category, so maybe 8.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "products used in creating prosthetic effects or adhering materials to the body". In that case, stage makeup would be a part of that, but maybe not exactly. Hmm. I might need to adjust. Let me think of each candidate again:

- Prop sword: Definitely a prop, not a material. 2
- Microphone: 0
- Spotlight: 1
- Lighting board: 0
- Stage makeup: 8 (since it's directly related but a category)
- Sound mixer: 0
- Costume jewelry: 1 (closer to costume than makeup)
- Theater curtain: 0

Alternatively, maybe stage makeup is a 10. Let me think: the examples are specific items in the category of theatrical makeup/sfx materials. So stage makeup products (like the makeup itself) would be a direct hit. But "stage makeup" is the general term, so maybe 9. But I need to be cautious. Let's say 8 to leave room for the examples being exact products. 

Final scores:

1. 2
2. 0
3. 1
4. 0
5. 8
6. 0
7. 1
8. 0

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Maybe some can be higher or lower. Let me check again. Maybe spotlight (3) is 2, since it's part of the technical but not directly related. Or maybe 1 is okay. Costume jewelry is 1. 

Alternatively, maybe stage makeup is a 9. Let me think of another angle. The examples are all materials or products that are applied physically to the body or used in creating physical effects (like spirit gum for attaching, rosin for grip on skin or fabric, latex for creating textures). Stage makeup would be the application of those materials, so the products used in that (like the makeup itself) would fit. So if the candidate is "stage makeup" as a product (like the actual makeup), then it's a 10. But if it's the category (the process), maybe 8. Since the user's examples are specific products, maybe "stage makeup" as a product would be a 10. Wait, but the examples are specific items like spirit gum, which are components of stage makeup. So "stage makeup" as a broader term might be 8. Hmm. Alternatively, if "stage makeup" is a type of product, then 9. I'll go with 8 to be cautious.

So the scores are as above.
