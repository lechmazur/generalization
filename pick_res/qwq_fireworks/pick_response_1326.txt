Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples share. The given examples are:

1. Lenticular prints that change image based on viewing angle.
2. 3D stereogram images that reveal a hidden picture with relaxed focus.
3. Thin section petrography slides showing minerals under polarized light.

Looking at these, they all involve some form of **physical or visual technique that requires a specific interaction or condition** to reveal hidden or alternative information. The key elements here are:

- **Physical interaction or specific viewing conditions** (like angle, focus, light polarization) are necessary to see the different aspects.
- **The change or revelation is inherent to the object itself**, not external factors like user input beyond basic viewing adjustments.
- They are **static in nature** (except for the interaction part), meaning they don't involve active participation beyond how you view them.

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. Optical illusions playing with perspective.
2. Interactive digital art changing with user input.
3. Transparent sculptures showing internal structures.

These are broader or related but differ in some way. For instance, optical illusions might rely on perspective but don't necessarily require a physical change in viewing angle to switch images. Interactive digital art involves user input, which is more active than passive viewing adjustments. Transparent sculptures might show structures but don't require a specific condition like angle or light to reveal something hidden.

So the **specific theme** seems to be: **Objects or images that reveal different information or images through specific, passive viewing conditions (angle, focus, light), without requiring active interaction beyond that.**

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Collages made from overlapping images**  
   Overlapping images might create depth or blend, but they don't change based on viewing angle or condition. The layers are static. So this is more about composition than a reveal through specific viewing.  
   **Score: 1**

2. **Scientific diagrams with labeled layers**  
   Labels and layers are meant to be seen all at once. No hidden info revealed by angle or focus. Purely informative.  
   **Score: 0**

3. **Holographic art depending on light and angle**  
   Holograms do change with light and angle, similar to lenticular prints. This fits the specific theme.  
   **Score: 10**

4. **3D printed objects with internal structures**  
   Viewing from different angles might show internal structures, but unless it's designed to reveal a hidden image or change significantly with angle (like a lenticular), it's more about inherent structure. Close but not exact.  
   **Score: 6**

5. **Landscape paintings with depth through layering**  
   Layering creates depth via perspective, but it's a static effect. Doesn't change with viewing angle; perspective is fixed.  
   **Score: 2**

6. **Geological strata in cliff faces**  
   Strata are visible through natural exposure. They don't require a specific viewing condition to reveal something hidden beyond basic observation. More about natural layers than a deliberate hidden reveal.  
   **Score: 3**

7. **Photographs with multiple exposures**  
   Multiple exposures blend layers in the photo itself. The image doesn't change based on how you view it; it's a composite.  
   **Score: 1**

8. **VR environments with multiple interaction layers**  
   Requires user interaction (active input) to explore layers, which is more like the anti-example of interactive digital art.  
   **Score: 2**

Wait, let me check again. The VR one is interactive, so it's more like the anti-example (interactive digital art), so it's a 2. The 3D printed objects might get a 6 because they can show internal structures when viewed from certain angles, but not exactly like lenticular which changes images. Holograms are spot on (10). Geological strata are natural, so maybe 3. Collages and photos are 1 or 0. Diagrams are 0. Landscapes 2. Yeah, that seems right.
