Okay, let me try to figure out what the specific theme is here. The examples given are The Alienist, Dexter, and The Mentalist. The anti-examples are Miss Marple, The Silence of the Lambs, and Sherlock Holmes.

First, I need to find the common thread among the examples. The Alienist is about a psychologist helping to catch a serial killer in the 1890s. Dexter is a show where the protagonist is a forensic blood spatter analyst who also is a vigilante killer. The Mentalist features a crime-solving consultant who uses psychological insight and "reading" people. So maybe the theme here is something related to psychology or mental expertise applied to crime-solving, but with a twist that goes beyond regular detective work. 

Now looking at the anti-examples: Miss Marple is a classic detective, Sherlock Holmes is the quintessential detective using logic, and The Silence of the Lambs involves a psychologist (Clarice Starling) and a criminal profiler, but also Hannibal Lecter. Wait, but Silence of the Lambs does involve psychological aspects. Hmm, maybe the key difference is that the examples have protagonists whose psychological skills are central but perhaps with a personal, darker edge or a more unconventional background? Dexter's main character has a dark side, The Alienist deals with a psychologist in a historical context, and The Mentalist's main character uses his "mentalism" as a tool but has a personal vendetta. 

The anti-examples might be more traditional detective stories or include elements that are more about classic whodunits or have a different focus. Miss Marple and Sherlock Holmes are classic detectives without the psychological complexity being their main focus, even though they are smart. The Silence of the Lambs does have psychological elements but maybe the presence of a villain like Hannibal Lecter makes it more of a thriller rather than focusing on the protagonist's psychological methods as the main theme.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. Hercule Poirot: He's a detective known for his "gray cells" and methodical approach. He's a classic detective like Sherlock, so similar to the anti-examples. So probably a low score, maybe 2 or 3.

2. Nancy Drew: She's a teenage detective solving mysteries, but not really using psychology as a main tool. More of a traditional amateur detective. So maybe 1 or 2.

3. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time: This is a novel from the perspective of a teenage boy with autism. It's a mystery but the protagonist's unique psychological perspective is central. This might fit the theme since it's about an atypical mind solving a problem. Maybe a 7 or 8?

4. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: A investigative journalist and a hacker solving a murder. The main characters have skills but not necessarily psychological profiling. More about investigative work. Maybe a 4 or 5.

5. The Cuckoo's Calling: This is a detective novel written by Robert Galbraith (J.K. Rowling) featuring Cormoran Strike, a detective. He's ex-military and uses his skills, but maybe not the psychological angle. However, the series does involve psychological aspects in some cases. Maybe a 5 or 6?

6. The Big Sleep: A Raymond Chandler novel with Philip Marlowe. Classic hardboiled detective. Not focused on psychology. Probably low, like 2.

7. The Maltese Falcon: Another classic detective novel with Sam Spade. Hardboiled, so similar to anti-examples. Maybe 1 or 2.

8. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency: Mma Ramotswe is a detective using her intuition and knowledge of people. That's somewhat psychological, but more about empathy and community. Maybe a 4 or 5?

Wait, let me reassess. The examples have a professional psychological angle (alienist, mentalist) or a character with a specific psychological trait (Dexter's code). The anti-examples include Silence of the Lambs which does have a psychologist but maybe the theme is more about the protagonist being a professional in a psychological field but with a twist (like Dexter's dual life). 

The Curious Incident's main character has autism, which is a psychological condition, and he solves the mystery through his unique perspective. That might fit well. The Cuckoo's Calling's Strike isn't a psychologist, but maybe his detective work involves understanding people. The Dragon Tattoo has Lisbeth Salander, who has her own psychological profile but isn't a psychologist. Nancy Drew is more of a traditional solver. 

So adjusting scores:

1. Hercule Poirot: 2 (classic detective, not psychological focus)
2. Nancy Drew: 1 (traditional, no psychological angle)
3. Curious Incident: 8 (central psychological perspective)
4. Dragon Tattoo: 4 (investigative but not psych-focused)
5. Cuckoo's Calling: 5 (detective work, some psych elements but not central)
6. Big Sleep: 2 (hardboiled, not psych)
7. Maltese Falcon: 1 (same as above)
8. No. 1 Ladies: 4 (uses intuition but not professional psych)
