Okay, let me try to figure out the theme here. The examples given are the Albanian double-headed eagle, the oak tree on the Welsh flag, and the Celtic shield knot in Irish art. So I need to see what they have in common.

First, the Albanian double-headed eagle is a national symbol, part of their heraldry. The Welsh flag has a red dragon usually, but the oak tree might be a regional or historical symbol. The Celtic shield knot is definitely a cultural or traditional symbol, probably tied to Irish heritage or art. So maybe the theme is national or cultural symbols specific to a nation or ethnic group, used in their official or traditional emblems?

Now the anti-examples are evil eye, dreamcatcher, ankh. The evil eye is a protective amulet used in various cultures, not tied to a specific nation. Dreamcatchers are Native American but maybe too broad or commercialized? Ankh is an ancient Egyptian symbol, which is a specific culture, but maybe the anti-examples are symbols that are more general or not tied to a nation's official symbols? Or perhaps they are more mystical or religious rather than national emblems?

So the key difference might be that the examples are specific to a nation's heraldry, flags, or traditional art, while the anti-examples are more general symbols used across different cultures or not tied to a specific nation's official symbols.

Looking at the candidates:

1. Rabbit's foot: A general good luck charm, not tied to a specific nation's official symbols. So probably a low score, maybe 1-3.

2. Tree of life: Appears in many cultures, like Norse, Middle Eastern, etc. Not specific to a nation's emblem. Maybe 2-4.

3. Pentagram: Can be a religious symbol (Baphomet, occult) or Wiccan, but also used in various contexts. Not a national symbol. Maybe 1-3.

4. Scarab beetle: Ancient Egyptian symbol, so tied to Egypt's culture, but is it used in their modern national symbols? The current flag doesn't have it, but maybe historical. Maybe 3-5.

5. Horseshoe: A general good luck symbol across many European cultures. Not tied to a specific nation's official emblem. Maybe 2-4.

6. Cross pendant: The cross is a Christian symbol, used in many national flags (like Scotland's saltire), but a generic cross pendant might not be specific. However, maybe some countries have crosses as national symbols. Hmm, maybe 4-6. For example, the Swedish flag has a cross, but a pendant might be too generic. Maybe 3-5.

7. Four-leaf clover: Traditionally Irish, associated with Ireland. The examples include Celtic knot which is Irish. So this might be a good match, maybe 7-8? But the four-leaf clover isn't on the Irish flag or official heraldry, though it's culturally associated. Maybe 5-7.

8. Thunder dragon on Bhutan's flag: That's exactly like the Albanian eagle and Welsh oak (if the oak is on their flag). The thunder dragon is Bhutan's national symbol on their flag. So this is a perfect 10? Wait, but the anti-examples were symbols not tied to a nation's specific emblem. So this should be a 10. Wait, but the user says the anti-examples are not the exact theme but could be part of a broader theme. So the thunder dragon is a direct match. So 10?

Wait, the user said to not output the theme but just the scores. Let me check again. The examples are all national or cultural symbols in official contexts (heraldry, flag, traditional art). The anti-examples are symbols that are more general or not tied to a nation's specific emblem.

So candidate 8 is exactly like the examples, so 10. The four-leaf clover is culturally Irish but not on their flag or heraldry (the Celtic knot is in art, but the clover is more of a folk symbol). So maybe 7. The cross pendant could be part of a national symbol like the Danish flag (which has a cross), but as a pendant, it's too generic. So maybe 4. The scarab is an Egyptian symbol but not on their current flag. Maybe 3. Horseshoe is 2. Rabbit's foot 1. Tree of life 3. Pentagram 1. Wait, need to adjust.

Wait, let me re-express:

Examples are national/cultural symbols used in official emblems (heraldry, flag, traditional art tied to the nation). So:

1. Rabbit's foot: generic luck charm, no specific nation's emblem. 0-2.

2. Tree of Life: appears in multiple cultures, not tied to a specific nation's flag/heraldry. Maybe 2-4.

3. Pentagram: Not tied to any nation's official symbol. 1-3.

4. Scarab: Ancient Egypt, but current Egypt's flag has the eagle, not scarab. So historical but not current official. Maybe 3.

5. Horseshoe: general European symbol, not part of any nation's flag. 2.

6. Cross pendant: If it's a specific cross like St. George's, but as a pendant, generic. Maybe 4, since some nations use crosses, but the pendant itself is too generic. Maybe 3.

7. Four-leaf clover: Irish cultural symbol, but not on their flag (they have the harp). Celtic knot is in art, but four-leaf is more folk. So maybe 6.

8. Thunder dragon: Exactly matches the examples. 10.

Wait, but the user said anti-examples are not exact matches but could be part of broader themes. So the thunder dragon is a perfect 10. Then four-leaf clover might be 7, since it's culturally linked but not in official heraldry. The cross pendant could be 4 if some nations use it, but as a pendant, not tied to a specific country. So:

1. Rabbit's foot: 1

2. Tree of Life: 3

3. Pentagram: 2

4. Scarab: 3

5. Horseshoe: 2

6. Cross pendant: 4

7. Four-leaf clover: 7

8. Thunder dragon: 10

Wait but the user wants scores from 0 to 10, using the full range. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the Celtic knot is part of Irish art, so four-leaf clover is also Irish, so 7. The cross pendant could be 5 if some countries have crosses in their flags (like Denmark's white cross), so a cross pendant might be associated with Denmark, but as a general pendant, maybe 4. 

Scarab is ancient Egypt's symbol, but since it's part of their cultural heritage, maybe 5? Hmm, but the current flag doesn't have it, so perhaps 3. 

The thunder dragon is definitely 10. 

Okay, I'll proceed with that.
