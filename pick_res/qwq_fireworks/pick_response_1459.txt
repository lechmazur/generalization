Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided examples and anti-examples, and I need to figure out the specific theme they're looking for. The examples are:

- A dinosaur named after Elvis Presley
- A fossilized mammal named after John Lennon
- An ancient reptile named after Audrey Hepburn

The anti-examples are:

- A recently extinct bird named after a poet
- A recently extinct insect named after a sculptor
- A living reptile named after a celebrity chef

First, I need to identify the specific theme from the examples. Let's break down the examples. All of them are prehistoric or ancient animals (dinosaur, fossilized mammal, ancient reptile). The namesakes are all famous people in the entertainment industry: Elvis Presley (musician), John Lennon (musician), Audrey Hepburn (actress). So the theme seems to be: **prehistoric/ancient animals named after famous entertainers.**

Now, looking at the anti-examples. They mention "recently extinct" or "living" species, and the namesakes are a poet, sculptor, and celebrity chef. These don't fit the prehistoric/ancient part, and the namesakes aren't necessarily entertainers (poet and sculptor are artists, but maybe not the same as musicians/actors; celebrity chef is a different field). So the anti-examples deviate in both time period (not ancient) and the type of person (non-entertainers? Or maybe broader, but not exactly the same category).

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Recently discovered spider named after a filmmaker.** 
   - Spider is an animal, but "recently discovered" doesn't specify prehistoric. Filmmaker is an entertainer, but the animal isn't ancient. So maybe a 3? Because filmmaker is an entertainer but the spider isn't ancient.

2. **Modern mammal named after a famous athlete.**
   - Modern vs. ancient. Athlete is a celebrity but not an entertainer. So probably low, maybe 2.

3. **Modern insect named after a fictional character.**
   - Modern insect, fictional character (not a real person). The examples use real people. So 0 or 1. Maybe 1 if fictional is close, but probably 0.

4. **Modern crustacean named after a composer.**
   - Modern again, but composer is an entertainer. So maybe 2? Because composer is related to arts but the animal isn't ancient.

5. **Prehistoric bird named after Marilyn Monroe.**
   - Prehistoric bird (matches the animal type) and Marilyn Monroe is an actress (entertainer). This is a strong match. Probably 10.

6. **Newly identified fungus named after a musician.**
   - Fungus isn't an animal (the examples are all animals). But musician is an entertainer. Newly identified doesn't specify prehistoric. So maybe 4? Since it's not an animal and not ancient.

7. **Living bird named after a scientist.**
   - Living bird, scientist is a non-entertainer. So 0 or 1. Maybe 1 if scientist is a notable person but not the right category.

8. **Recently discovered fish named after a politician.**
   - Recently discovered (not ancient), politician is a non-entertainer. So maybe 1 or 2.

Wait, let me check again. The examples all have ancient/prehistoric animals (dinosaur, fossilized mammal, ancient reptile). The key elements are:

- The animal must be ancient/prehistoric/fossilized.
- The namesake must be a famous entertainer (musician, actor).

Anti-examples have either:

- Recently extinct or modern (so not ancient)
- Namesakes are poets, sculptors, chefs (not entertainers in the same category)

So the scoring should prioritize both the animal's age and the namesake's field.

Let me reassess each candidate:

1. Spider: recently discovered (not ancient). Filmmaker is an entertainer. So animal not ancient, but namesake fits. Maybe 3?

2. Modern mammal (not ancient), athlete (non-entertainer). 1?

3. Modern insect (non-ancient), fictional (non-person). 0?

4. Modern crustacean (non-ancient), composer (entertainer). So namesake fits but animal not ancient. 2?

5. Prehistoric bird (ancient), Marilyn Monroe (entertainer). Perfect match. 10.

6. Fungus (not animal), musician (entertainer). So animal wrong category, but namesake fits. Maybe 4? Since fungus isn't an animal like the examples, but the theme is about animals. So maybe 2?

Wait, the examples are all animals (dinosaur, mammal, reptile). So the candidate must be an animal. Fungus is a fungus, not an animal. So that's a disqualifier. So 0? But the namesake is musician. Hmm. Maybe 1 because it's a living organism but not animal, and prehistoric? Wait "newly identified fungus" – not necessarily ancient. So both animal type wrong and not ancient. So 0.

7. Living bird (non-ancient), scientist (non-entertainer). 0.

8. Recently discovered fish (non-ancient), politician (non-entertainer). 0 or 1? Maybe 1.

Wait, but the anti-examples include a living reptile named after a chef, which is a 0. So maybe the anti-examples are 0, but the candidates might have some points?

Alternatively, perhaps the scale allows some middle ground. Let me think again.

The key is the specific theme is: ancient/prehistoric animals named after famous entertainers.

So for each candidate:

1. Spider: recent (so no), but filmmaker (yes). So half points? Maybe 5? Wait but the examples are all ancient. So if the animal isn't ancient, it's a big miss. So maybe 3.

2. Modern mammal: wrong time, athlete (non-entertainer). 1.

3. Modern insect, fictional character (non-person). 0.

4. Modern crustacean (wrong time), composer (yes). So maybe 2.

5. Prehistoric bird (yes) and Monroe (yes). 10.

6. Fungus (not animal) and musician (yes). So since it's not an animal, even if namesake is right, it's 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

7. Living bird (wrong time), scientist (wrong person). 0.

8. Recently discovered fish (wrong time), politician (wrong person). 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

Wait, but the anti-examples have a recently extinct bird named after a poet. That would be a 0. So similar to candidate 1, which is a spider named after a filmmaker. The anti-example is a bird (animal) but recently extinct (not ancient) and poet (non-entertainer). So the anti-example's score would be 0. So candidate 1 is an animal (spider), recently discovered (so not ancient), but filmmaker (entertainer). So compared to the anti-example, which is worse (non-entertainer), maybe candidate 1 is better than the anti-examples. So perhaps a 3.

Similarly, the composer (candidate 4) is an entertainer, so better than poet or sculptor. So maybe 2.

The fungus (6) is not an animal, so even if namesake is good, it's 0.

Fish (8) is recent, politician (non-entertainer), so 0.

Living bird (7): scientist, so 0.

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 1

3. 0

4. 2

5. 10

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

Wait but the user said to use the full range, so maybe some in between?

Alternatively, maybe candidate 6 could be 1 because the namesake is a musician, even though the organism isn't an animal. But the examples are all animals. So it's half the criteria met? Maybe 1.

Similarly, candidate 4: modern crustacean (wrong time) but composer (yes). So maybe 3?

Wait, maybe I need to consider how close they are. Let me try again with a more nuanced approach:

For each candidate, check two factors: 

1. Is the organism ancient/prehistoric/fossilized? (0-5 points)
2. Is the namesake a famous entertainer? (0-5 points)

Then total out of 10. 

Wait, but maybe better to assign a score based on both. Let's try:

1. Spider: recent (0/5 on time) + filmmaker (5/5 on namesake). Total 5? But the examples are both, so if either is missing, it's lower. Maybe 3? Because even if the namesake is good, the time is bad.

Alternatively, if both are needed, then it's (time score + namesake score)/2. But perhaps the user wants a more intuitive approach.

Alternatively, think of it as:

- Perfect match (both criteria): 10
- One criteria met (either ancient or entertainer): 5
- Neither: 0

But maybe there are gradations. For example, if the animal is a bit ancient but not quite (like "recently discovered" but maybe it's a fossil? Not sure). But the examples are all clearly ancient.

Alternatively:

For each candidate:

1. **Recently discovered spider named after a filmmaker**: "recently discovered" likely means modern, not ancient. Filmmaker is an entertainer. So 1 point for namesake, 0 for time. Maybe 3/10.

2. **Modern mammal named after a famous athlete**: modern (0), athlete (non-entertainer, maybe a celebrity but not in the same category as musicians/actors). 0-1 for namesake. So 1.

3. **Modern insect named after a fictional character**: modern (0), fictional (0). 0.

4. **Modern crustacean named after a composer**: modern (0), composer is an entertainer (5). So maybe 2.

5. **Prehistoric bird named after Marilyn Monroe**: both yes. 10.

6. **Newly identified fungus named after a musician**: not an animal (so even if prehistoric, but fungus is a different kingdom). Namesake good, but animal wrong. So maybe 1.

7. **Living bird named after a scientist**: living (0), scientist (0). 0.

8. **Recently discovered fish named after a politician**: recent (0), politician (0). 0.

Alternatively, maybe the "newly identified fungus" is ancient? If "newly identified" could mean discovered recently but the fungus itself is ancient? Unlikely. Probably modern. So 0.

Therefore the scores would be as I initially thought:

1. 3

2. 1

3. 0

4. 2

5. 10

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

But the user wants the scores to use the full range, so maybe some candidates get 4 or 6?

Wait, let's see candidate 4: modern crustacean named after a composer. Composer is an entertainer. So the namesake is good. The time is wrong. So maybe 3? Because namesake is fully there but time is bad. Maybe 4?

Alternatively, if the maximum for one criteria is 5, so (5 +0)/10 =5? But the user might not want that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the time is more critical. Because the examples all have the time element. So without the ancient aspect, it's a big miss. So 1 or 2 for the namesake but time wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps:

- For time: if it's ancient, +5, if modern, 0.

- For namesake: if it's an entertainer, +5, else 0.

Total score is sum divided by 2? So:

1. 0 (time) +5 (filmmaker) = 5/10? But maybe the user expects a different scaling. Alternatively, 5 would be halfway. But the examples are all 10, so maybe the scores are based on how close they are.

Alternatively, if the two factors are multiplied, but that might be too harsh. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants a linear scale where both factors are considered. Let me think of the anti-examples:

The first anti-example is a recently extinct bird named after a poet. That would be:

Time: recently extinct (so not ancient) → 0

Namesake: poet (non-entertainer) →0 → total 0.

Second anti-example: recently extinct insect named after a sculptor → same 0.

Third: living reptile named after celebrity chef → 0+0=0.

So the anti-examples are 0, which is correct.

Now for candidate 1:

Time: recent →0, namesake: filmmaker (entertainer →5). So maybe 5? But the user's examples are 10. Alternatively, since both are needed, it's 0 for time and 5 for namesake, but they are separate. The user might consider that having one correct is better than none, so 5?

But the user wants the scores to be nuanced. Let me check the instructions again: "use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), not a limited range."

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to give higher scores for candidates that have one of the two criteria. For instance:

- If both criteria are met →10

- If only time is met but namesake is not → maybe 2-3?

- If only namesake is met but time is wrong → maybe 4-6?

- If neither →0.

Wait, but in the examples, the namesake must be an entertainer. So if time is wrong but namesake is correct, it's better than a candidate with correct time but wrong namesake? Not sure. Maybe they should be symmetric.

Alternatively:

Each criterion is worth 5 points. So:

- Ancient: 5, namesake:5 →10.

- Ancient but wrong namesake (e.g., named after a scientist): 5 (ancient) +0 (namesake)=5.

- Modern but correct namesake (entertainer): 0 +5=5.

- Neither:0.

But then candidates like 1 and 4 would get 5, which is mid-range. But the user might want lower for missing one.

Alternatively, maybe each criterion is worth 10, but they have to be both present. So if one is missing, it's 0. But that's too strict.

Alternatively, maybe:

- 10: both criteria.

- 7: one criterion met (either time or namesake).

- 3: one partial (e.g., time is ancient but namesake is a poet → but that's like anti-example, so maybe 3 is too high).

Hmm, perhaps the user expects that the two criteria (ancient animal + entertainer namesake) are both required. So any missing one reduces the score. So:

- Both:10

- Only time: 5

- Only namesake:5

- Neither:0

But then candidates 1 and 4 would get 5. But maybe the user wants more granularity.

Alternatively, maybe the time is more important. Because all examples are ancient. So if the animal isn't ancient, it's a big miss. So:

- If ancient and correct namesake:10

- Ancient but wrong namesake: maybe 6 (since time is right but namesake wrong)

- Modern but correct namesake: 4 (namesake right but time wrong)

- Neither:0

Then:

Candidate 1 (modern + correct namesake):4

Candidate4 (modern + correct namesake):4

Candidate6 (modern and correct namesake but not animal): maybe 2 (since it's not an animal, even if namesake is right)

Wait, candidate6 is a fungus. So even if namesake is correct, since it's not an animal, that's another criteria missing. So maybe 0 or 1.

Alternatively, maybe the animal type (must be an animal) is another criterion. The examples are all animals. So another layer:

- Animal type: must be animal (so non-animals are out)

- Ancient

- Entertainer namesake

So three criteria:

1. Animal: yes/no (0 or 5?)

2. Ancient: yes/no (0 or5)

3. Namesake: yes/no (0 or5)

Total 15, scaled to 10? Maybe each is 3-3-4?

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the user expects a simpler approach.

Let me go back to the original thought, with scores as follows:

1. Recently discovered spider (non-ancient) + filmmaker (yes): 3

2. Modern mammal + athlete (non-entertainer):1

3. Modern insect + fictional:0

4. Modern crustacean + composer (yes):2

5. Prehistoric bird + Monroe (yes):10

6. Fungus (non-animal) + musician (yes):0 (since it's not an animal)

7. Living bird + scientist:0

8. Recent fish + politician:0

This uses the full range (0,1,2,3,10). But the user wants all numbers up to 10. Maybe adjust:

Maybe candidate4 gets 3 instead of 2. Because composer is an entertainer, so maybe a bit higher.

Candidate6: since namesake is good but not animal, maybe 1?

Candidate1: 4?

Alternatively, let me think of the scores as:

- For each of the two main criteria (ancient and entertainer):

    - If both, 10.

    - If one, 5.

    - If neither, 0.

But then:

1. Entertainer yes, ancient no →5.

2. Entertainer no (athlete not exactly), ancient no →0.

Wait, but athlete is a celebrity, but not an entertainer? Maybe a 1?

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I should proceed with the initial scores but ensure that at least some numbers in the middle are used.

Alternatively:

1. 4 (entertainer but not ancient)

2. 1 (neither)

3.0

4. 3 (entertainer but not ancient)

5.10

6.1 (entertainer but not animal)

7.0

8.0

This uses 0,1,3,4,10.

Alternatively, maybe composer (candidate4) is a strong entertainer, so 5.

But I need to decide and stick with it. Let me go with the first assessment but adjust a bit:

1. 3

2. 1

3.0

4. 2

5.10

6.1 (since namesake is good but not animal)

7.0

8.0

This uses 0,1,2,3,10. Not using 4-9. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe candidate6 is a 1, candidate4 is 3, candidate1 is 4.

Then:

1.4

2.1

3.0

4.3

5.10

6.1

7.0

8.0

That uses 0,1,3,4,10.

Alternatively, maybe:

1. Recently discovered spider (recent, so not ancient) but filmmaker (entertainer): 5 (half points because one criteria met)

2. Modern mammal + athlete (non-entertainer): 0

3.0

4. Modern crustacean + composer (entertainer):5

5.10

6. Fungus (non-animal) + musician (entertainer):2 (since namesake right but not animal)

7.0

8.0

This uses 0,2,5,10.

Hmm. The user wants the full range. Maybe I should allow some higher scores for partial matches beyond 5.

Alternatively, let's think of each criterion as a multiplier:

If both criteria are met →10.

If one is met, then 7 (since it's partially there).

If neither, 0.

But then candidates 1,4,6 would get 7, but maybe that's too high.

Alternatively, 7 for one criteria, 3 for partial? Not sure.

Alternatively, the scale is like:

- 10: both criteria.

- 7: one criteria met (either ancient or namesake).

- 4: one criteria met but the other is a bit there (e.g., time is ancient but namesake is a poet → but that's anti-example, so maybe 0).

Wait, perhaps the best way is to assign scores based on how close they are to the examples:

Example 5 is perfect. 

Candidates 1,4,6 have one of the criteria (namesake) but not the other.

Candidates 2,3,7,8 have neither or worse.

So for the ones with one criteria (1,4,6):

- 1 has namesake (filmmaker) but not ancient. So maybe 6? (since halfway between 0 and 10 for one criteria)

- 4 has namesake (composer) but not ancient →6

- 6 has namesake (musician) but not ancient and not an animal → maybe 4 (since it's not an animal, which is another criteria)

Wait, the examples are all animals. So candidate6 isn't an animal, so even if namesake is good, it's worse than 1 and4. So 4 for 6, and 6 for 1 and4.

Then:

1.6

4.6

6.4

Others:

2. recently extinct (but anti-example is 0). So 1?

Wait, candidate2 is modern mammal (so not ancient) named after athlete (non-entertainer). So neither criteria. So 0.

Candidate1 and 4 are one criteria met (namesake), so 6 and 6?

Candidate6: namesake yes but not animal →4.

Candidate3: 0 (both wrong)

Candidate7:0

Candidate8:0

So the scores would be:

1.6

2.0

3.0

4.6

5.10

6.4

7.0

8.0

This uses 0,4,6,10.

Better, but still missing some numbers.

Alternatively, maybe:

Candidate1: filmmaker (entertainer) but modern →5.

Candidate4: composer (entertainer) but modern →5.

Candidate6: musician but not animal →3.

Then:

1.5

4.5

6.3

Others:

2.0

3.0

7.0

8.0

Now scores:0,3,5,10.

Still missing some.

Alternatively, let me think of each as follows:

- The theme requires:

    1. Prehistoric/Ancient (dinosaur, fossilized, ancient)

    2. Named after an entertainer (Elvis, Lennon, Hepburn)

    3. The animal must be an animal (not plant/fungi)

So three criteria.

Each criterion can contribute to the score:

For each candidate:

Score = (Number of criteria met) * (3.33) → roughly, but to integers.

But let's see:

For candidate5: all 3 →10.

Candidate1: meets 2 (animal and entertainer) but not ancient → 6-7?

Candidate4: same as 1 →6-7.

Candidate6: meets 1 (entertainer) and 3 (animal? No, it's fungus. So 0 for animal. So only namesake → 3.3 → ~3.

Candidate2: meets animal but neither ancient nor entertainer →0.

Candidate3: meets animal but neither →0.

Candidate7: animal but neither →0.

Candidate8: animal but neither →0.

Thus:

1.7

4.7

6.3

Others:0.

This uses 0,3,7,10.

Hmm. Alternatively, each criterion is worth 3-4 points.

Alternatively, the user's examples are all animals, so non-animals are 0.

So:

Candidate1 (animal yes, ancient no, namesake yes):

Animal: yes (5)

Ancient: no (0)

Namesake: yes (5)

Total: (5+0+5)/3 *10? Not sure.

Alternatively, since all three criteria are needed, the score could be:

If all three:10.

If two:7.

If one:3.

None:0.

So:

Candidate1: animal yes, namesake yes → two criteria →7.

Candidate4: same →7.

Candidate6: namesake yes, but animal no →1 criteria →3.

So:

1.7

2.0

3.0

4.7

5.10

6.3

7.0

8.0

This uses 0,3,7,10. Still missing some.

But the user wants the full range. Maybe I need to allow more granularity.

Alternatively, the score can be calculated as follows:

Each of the three criteria (animal, ancient, entertainer) is worth 3-4 points. Let's say each is worth 3.33, so total 10.

Candidate5 has all three →10.

Candidate1:

Animal: yes (3.33)

Ancient: no (0)

Entertainer: yes (3.33)

Total: 6.66 →7.

Candidate4: same as 1 →7.

Candidate6:

Animal: no (0)

Ancient: no (0)

Entertainer: yes (3.33)

Total:3.33→3.

Candidate2:

Animal: yes (3.33)

Ancient: no (0)

Entertainer: no (0)

Total:3.33→3? Wait, but the namesake is athlete, not an entertainer. So actually, 0 for entertainer. So total 3.33 for animal only →3.

But candidate2's namesake is athlete, which is a celebrity but not an entertainer. So maybe 0 for that.

Thus, candidate2's score: only animal →3.33→3.

Similarly, candidate7: animal (bird) yes →3.33→3.

Candidate8: animal (fish) yes →3.33→3.

Candidate3: insect (animal yes) but namesake is fictional →so only animal:3.

Wait, but fictional character is not a person, so namesake is wrong. So same as others.

So:

Candidate2: animal yes →3.

Candidate3: animal yes →3.

Candidate7: animal yes →3.

Candidate8: animal yes →3.

Candidate1:7

Candidate4:7

Candidate6:3

Candidate5:10

Thus the scores would be:

1.7

2.3

3.3

4.7

5.10

6.3

7.3

8.3

This uses 3,7,10. Still missing some numbers.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to assign scores based on:

- Perfect match:10

- One criteria missing (either ancient or namesake) but not both:5-7

- Two criteria missing:1-3

- All missing:0.

So:

Candidate1: missing ancient →7

Candidate4: same →7

Candidate6: missing ancient and animal →1 (since only namesake is there but not animal)

Candidate2: missing both ancient and namesake →1 (only animal is there)

Candidate3: same →1

Candidate7: same →1

Candidate8: same →1

Thus:

1.7

2.1

3.1

4.7

5.10

6.1

7.1

8.1

This uses 1,7,10. Still not the full range.

Alternatively, let's consider that the namesake being an entertainer is more important than the time. Maybe:

- If the namesake is an entertainer and the animal is ancient →10.

- If namesake is entertainer but not ancient →7.

- If ancient but namesake not →5.

- If neither →0.

- If namesake is non-entertainer but ancient → maybe 3.

Wait, but the anti-examples have recently extinct (not ancient) and non-entertainers, which are 0.

So:

Candidate1: namesake yes, ancient no →7.

Candidate4: same →7.

Candidate6: namesake yes but not animal → maybe 5 (since it's not an animal, but maybe the namesake is good)?

No, because not an animal.

Alternatively, namesake yes but not ancient and not animal →3.

Candidate2: namesake (athlete is a celebrity but not entertainer?), ancient no →0.

Candidate3: namesake fictional →0.

Candidate7: scientist →0.

Candidate8: politician →0.

Thus:

1.7

4.7

6.3

others 0.

Still missing some.

Alternatively, let me think of the scores as follows:

- 10 for the perfect match.

- 7 for missing one criteria (either time or namesake).

- 4 for missing two criteria.

- 0 for missing all.

But for candidate6, it's missing time and animal → so two criteria →4? But the namesake is there.

Wait, criteria are:

1. Animal.

2. Ancient.

3. Entertainer.

Candidate6 misses 1 and 2 → two criteria →4.

Candidate2 misses 2 and 3 → two criteria →4.

Candidate3 misses 2 and 3 →4.

Candidate7 misses 2 and 3 →4.

Candidate8 misses 2 and3 →4.

Candidate1 misses 2 → so one criteria →7.

Candidate4 misses 2 →7.

Candidate6: misses 1 and2 → two →4.

Thus:

1.7

2.4

3.4

4.7

5.10

6.4

7.4

8.4

This uses 4,7,10.

Still missing middle numbers like 2,3,5,6,8,9.

Hmm. Maybe the user allows some other factors. For example, "prehistoric" vs "fossilized" vs "ancient" might be nuances, but the examples include "ancient reptile" and "fossilized mammal", so "prehistoric" covers it.

Alternatively, maybe "modern" is a strong negative, so candidates with modern get lower scores than those with prehistoric but wrong namesake.

Wait candidate5 is the only one with both right.

Candidate4 is modern crustacean named after composer → so namesake is good but modern → maybe 4?

Candidate1 is modern spider named after filmmaker →4.

Candidate6 is fungus named after musician → maybe 2 (since namesake is good but not animal and not ancient).

Candidates2-3-7-8 are modern and wrong namesake →1.

Thus:

1.4

2.1

3.1

4.4

5.10

6.2

7.1

8.1

This uses 1,2,4,10.

Still not the full range, but better.

Alternatively, let's make:

- For each of the two main criteria (ancient and namesake):

    - If both, 10.

    - If ancient but wrong namesake → 6 (since time is right but namesake not).

    - If modern but correct namesake →4 (namesake right but time wrong).

    - If neither →0.

    - Non-animal with correct namesake →2 (since it's not an animal but namesake is there).

Thus:

Candidate1 (modern + correct namesake):4.

Candidate4 (modern + correct namesake):4.

Candidate6 (non-animal + correct namesake):2.

Candidates2-3-7-8 (modern + wrong namesake):0 or 1.

Wait, candidate2's namesake is athlete (not an entertainer). So modern + wrong namesake →0.

Candidate3's namesake is fictional →0.

Candidates7 and8 similarly →0.

Thus:

1.4

2.0

3.0

4.4

5.10

6.2

7.0

8.0

This uses 0,2,4,10.

Hmm. I think I'll proceed with the initial approach but adjust some scores to ensure a wider range.

Final decision:

1. Recently discovered spider (modern) + filmmaker (yes) → 4 (namesake good but time wrong).

2. Modern mammal + athlete (non-entertainer) →1 (only animal).

3. Modern insect + fictional →0 (no).

4. Modern crustacean + composer (yes) →3 (namesake good).

5. Prehistoric bird + Monroe →10.

6. Fungus (non-animal) + musician (yes) →2 (namesake but not animal).

7. Living bird + scientist →0.

8. Recent fish + politician →0.

Thus:

1.4

2.1

3.0

4.3

5.10

6.2

7.0

8.0

This uses 0,1,2,3,4,10. Still missing 5-9 but better.

Alternatively, maybe:

Candidate4 gets 5 because composer is a strong entertainer.

Candidate1 gets 5.

Candidate6 gets 3.

Then:

1.5

2.1

3.0

4.5

5.10

6.3

7.0

8.0

This includes 0,1,3,5,10.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and to adhere to the user's request, I'll go with the initial scores but adjust a few to spread out the numbers more:

1. Recently discovered spider (modern, but filmmaker) → 5 (since namesake is good but time wrong)

2. Modern mammal + athlete →1 (only animal)

3.0

4. Modern crustacean + composer →4 (namesake good, but time wrong)

5.10

6. Fungus + musician →2 (namesake but not animal)

7.0

8.0

Thus:

1.5

2.1

3.0

4.4

5.10

6.2

7.0

8.0

This uses 0,1,2,4,5,10. Still not all numbers but better. Maybe candidate6 can be 3.

Alternatively, I'll proceed with the first assessment but ensure at least some middle numbers.
