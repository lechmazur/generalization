Okay, let me try to figure out the theme here. The examples given are Uluru/Ayers Rock, Mount Kailash, and Bear Butte. All three are significant landmarks, but what's the common theme? Let me think.

Uluru is a sacred site for Indigenous Australians. Mount Kailash is a holy mountain in Tibetan Buddhism. Bear Butte is a sacred site for Native American tribes, especially the Lakota. So the common theme seems to be sacred or spiritually significant sites for specific cultures or religions.

Now the anti-examples are Mount Sinai, Grand Canyon, and Giant's Causeway. Mount Sinai is sacred (Judaism/Christianity/Islam), but maybe it's too well-known or part of a major religion's canon? The Grand Canyon is a natural wonder but not specifically tied to a religion's sacredness. Giant's Causeway is a natural wonder with myths but not a central sacred site for an ongoing religion or culture. So the anti-examples are either too mainstream in their sacredness, not specifically tied to a culture, or just natural wonders without the sacred aspect.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. Victoria Falls: A natural wonder. It has local names like Mosi-oa-Tunya, which means "The Smoke That Thunders," and has spiritual significance for local tribes. But is it as central to a culture's spirituality as the examples? Maybe a 6 or 7?

Wait, but the anti-examples include Grand Canyon, which is a natural wonder without the sacred aspect. So Victoria Falls might have some spiritual significance but maybe not as much as the examples. Maybe a 5 or 6?

2. The Great Pyramid of Giza: Ancient Egyptian, a tomb. It's a cultural icon but not a currently sacred site. The anti-examples include Giant's Causeway (mythical but not a central site) and Grand Canyon (natural). The pyramid might be historical but not actively sacred. So maybe a 3?

3. Stonehenge: A Neolithic site with possible spiritual or astronomical significance. It's sacred to some modern groups, but originally built for unknown purposes. Not as central to a modern culture's religion like the examples. Maybe a 4 or 5?

4. Niagara Falls: Natural wonder. Similar to Grand Canyon as an anti-example. Unless there's a specific spiritual tie, but I think it's more of a tourist spot. So 1 or 2?

5. Angel Falls: Another natural wonder. Like Victoria Falls, but maybe even less tied to a specific sacred tradition? Maybe a 3 or 4?

6. Mount Everest: A high mountain. Some consider it sacred in Tibetan Buddhism (since it's in the Himalayas), but I'm not sure if it's as central as Kailash. Maybe a 6? Wait, but Mount Kailash is specifically mentioned as an example. Everest might be considered sacred but perhaps not as much. Maybe 5?

7. Mount Fuji: Sacred in Shintoism, with shrines and considered a holy mountain. That's similar to the examples. So maybe a 9 or 8?

8. Easter Island Statues: Moai are culturally significant to the Rapa Nui people, with spiritual meanings. But is it as central as the examples? Maybe a 7 or 8? Since the examples include Bear Butte (a natural site with statues?), but Easter Island's statues are more artifacts than natural landmarks. Hmm. Maybe a 6 or 7?

Wait, let's reassess. The examples are all natural landmarks (rock formations or mountains) that are sacred. So Stonehenge is man-made, so maybe lower. Easter Island statues are man-made too, so maybe lower. The Great Pyramid is man-made, so lower. Victoria Falls and Angel Falls are natural but maybe not as sacred. Mount Fuji is natural and sacred, so high. Mount Everest might be sacred but not as much as Kailash. 

So:

1. Victoria Falls: 6 (has some spiritual significance but maybe not as central as the examples)
2. Great Pyramid: 3 (historical, not active sacred site)
3. Stonehenge: 4 (spiritual but man-made and not as central)
4. Niagara Falls: 1 (natural wonder, no strong sacred tie)
5. Angel Falls: 4 (spiritual but less so than Victoria?)
Wait, maybe Angel Falls is in Venezuela, and maybe local tribes have some stories, but not as established? Maybe 3?
6. Mount Everest: 5 (some sacredness but not as primary as Kailash)
7. Mount Fuji: 9 (definitely sacred in Shinto)
8. Easter Island: 6 (cultural but man-made, not natural)
Wait, but Bear Butte is a natural site with cultural significance. Easter Island is statues, man-made. So maybe 5 or 6?

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me adjust:

1. Victoria Falls: 6
2. Great Pyramid: 3
3. Stonehenge: 5
4. Niagara Falls: 2
5. Angel Falls: 4
6. Mount Everest: 5
7. Mount Fuji: 9
8. Easter Island: 6

But need to make sure they are on a scale where examples are 10, and anti-examples are lower. The examples are all 10. The anti-examples like Mount Sinai (which is sacred but maybe too mainstream?) are excluded, so maybe Mount Sinai would be a 7 but it's an anti-example. Wait, the user says the anti-examples do not match the specific theme but can match a broader one. So maybe Mount Sinai is sacred but part of a major world religion, so the specific theme is indigenous or local sacred sites? Because the examples are all local to specific cultures (Australian Aboriginal, Tibetan, Native American). So the theme is sacred sites of indigenous or specific local cultures, not part of major world religions. 

So Mount Sinai is part of Abrahamic religions, which are major, so it's an anti-example. Similarly, the Great Pyramid is part of a major ancient civilization but not a current sacred site. 

So for the candidates:

Victoria Falls has local spiritual significance (maybe 7)

Great Pyramid: 3 (not current, part of major ancient Egypt but not a sacred site now)

Stonehenge: part of druidic traditions but maybe considered more archaeological. Maybe 5.

Niagara Falls: 1 (just a tourist spot)

Angel Falls: 4 (maybe local stories but not as established as Victoria?)

Mount Everest: some sacredness in Tibetan Buddhism, but maybe not as central as Kailash, so 6?

Mount Fuji: Shinto sacred mountain, so 9 (since Shinto is tied to Japanese culture)

Easter Island: sacred to Rapa Nui, so 7 (man-made but culturally significant)

Wait, so maybe:

1. Victoria Falls: 7
2. Great Pyramid: 3
3. Stonehenge: 5
4. Niagara Falls: 1
5. Angel Falls: 4
6. Everest: 6
7. Fuji: 9
8. Easter: 7

But need to ensure that the scores are spread out. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe Victoria Falls is 7, Easter is 7, but the examples are all 10. Let's see:

Original examples are all natural sites sacred to indigenous/local cultures. So:

- Mount Fuji is a natural site sacred in Shinto (Japanese indigenous religion), so 10? But maybe the user's examples are in different continents, so maybe 9.

- Easter Island statues are man-made but culturally sacred to Rapa Nui, so maybe 8?

Wait, the examples are all natural formations (Uluru is a rock, Mount Kailash a mountain, Bear Butte a butte). So man-made sites like Easter and Stonehenge might be lower. So Easter Island is 6, Stonehenge 5.

Victoria Falls is a natural site with spiritual significance, so 7 or 8?

Angel Falls is similar to Victoria but maybe less known, so 6?

Mount Everest: sacred in Tibetan Buddhism, but perhaps not as much as Kailash, so 5.

So maybe:

1. Victoria: 8
2. GP: 3
3. Stonehenge:4
4. Niagara:1
5. Angel:6
6. Everest:5
7. Fuji:9
8. Easter:6

Hmm. Let me try to assign numbers based on how close they are to the examples (natural, indigenous sacred):

- Mount Fuji: definitely 9 or 10, but since the examples are 10, maybe 9.

- Easter Island: 7 (man-made but culturally important)

- Victoria Falls: 8 (natural, local significance)

- Angel Falls: 6 (similar but maybe less so)

- Everest: 5 (some sacredness but not as primary)

- Stonehenge: 4 (man-made, spiritual but not as central)

- Niagara: 1 (no)

- Great Pyramid: 3 (historical, not current sacred)

So final scores:

1. Victoria Falls: 8

2. Great Pyramid: 3

3. Stonehenge:4

4. Niagara Falls:1

5. Angel Falls:6

6. Mount Everest:5

7. Mount Fuji:9

8. Easter Island Statues:7

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be as per the specific theme. Since the examples are all natural sacred sites of indigenous/local cultures, and the anti-examples include things like major religious sites (Mount Sinai) or natural wonders without the sacred aspect (Grand Canyon). So:

Victoria Falls has the local spiritual name and significance, so higher. Angel Falls might be similar but perhaps not as central. 

Easter Island's statues are definitely sacred to their culture, but since they're man-made, maybe a bit lower than natural sites. So 7.

Stonehenge is ancient but part of modern druidic traditions, maybe 5?

Wait, maybe:

Stonehenge: 5

Easter:7

Victoria:8

Angel:6

Everest:5 (since some consider it sacred but maybe not as much as Kailash)

Fuji:9

Niagara:1

GP:3

So the scores would be:

1. Victoria Falls:8

2. GP:3

3. Stonehenge:5

4. Niagara:1

5. Angel:6

6. Everest:5

7. Fuji:9

8. Easter:7

But need to ensure that the scores are granular. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe Angel Falls is 4 because it's less known and maybe not as actively venerated. 

Hmm. I'll proceed with these scores.
