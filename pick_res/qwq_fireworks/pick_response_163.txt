Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided examples of a specific theme and some anti-examples. The task is to score each candidate from 0 to 10 based on how well they match the specific theme but not the broader or related ones. 

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples all mention masks with movable lower jaws controlled by cords or strings, used in traditional healing ceremonies, spiritual rituals, or shamanistic rites. The key elements here are: 
1. Movable lower jaw (hinged or articulated)
2. Controlled by internal cords or pull strings
3. Used in specific cultural/ritual contexts (healing, spiritual, shamanistic)

The anti-examples include masks with fixed jaws, no moving parts, or used in different contexts like storytelling, festivals, or ventriloquism. These are excluded because they don't have the movable jaw mechanism or are used in non-ritual contexts.

Now, let's look at each candidate:

1. **Mask with a snap-on jaw for puppet shows**: The jaw is snap-on, which might be removable but not necessarily movable via cords. Puppet shows are a different context than spiritual rituals. So probably low score, maybe 2 or 3.

2. **Mask with static features for theater**: Static means no moving parts. Theater performances aren't the same as traditional rituals. Definitely a 0 or 1.

3. **Magnetic jaw for educational demos**: Magnetic attachment could allow movement, but the use is educational, not ritual. The mechanism isn't cords. Maybe 2 or 3.

4. **Sliding panel in magic shows**: Sliding panel might move, but it's for magic, not rituals. The mechanism isn't cords. Maybe 1 or 2.

5. **Shamanic mask with strings for tribal dances**: This matches all three elements: articulated jaw via strings, shamanic/ritual use. Should be a high score, maybe 9 or 10.

6. **Pull-tab mask in children's toys**: Pull-tab is a different mechanism (tab vs. internal cords). Used in toys, not rituals. So around 3-5.

7. **Feather/bead mask for Mardi Gras**: No moving jaw, just decorative. Mardi Gras is a festival, so anti-example context. 0 or 1.

8. **Flexible rubber jaw in horror movies**: Flexible might mean some movement, but not controlled by cords. Horror movies are different from rituals. Maybe 2-4.

Wait, let me recheck each one more carefully.

Candidate 1: "snap-on jaw" – snap-on implies attaching/detaching, not necessarily moving during use. Puppet shows are non-ritual, so definitely low. Maybe 2.

Candidate 2: Static features, theater – 0.

Candidate3: Magnetic jaw. Movement via magnet instead of cords. Educational use. So maybe 2.

Candidate4: Sliding panel. The mechanism isn't cords. Magic show is non-ritual. 1.

Candidate5: Perfect match. 10?

Wait the examples all have "ceremonial", "spiritual", "shamanistic". Tribal dances could be part of rituals. So yes, 10?

Candidate6: Pull-tab. Mechanism is a pull-tab, which is different from internal cords. But it's a pull, so maybe similar. But the use is children's toys, not rituals. So maybe 3 or 4.

Candidate7: Mardi Gras is a festival, so anti-example. 0.

Candidate8: Flexible rubber jaw. Movement might be inherent, not via cords. Horror movies are not ritual contexts. So maybe 2.

Wait, but the examples specify "operated by a pull string", "controlled by internal cords", "cord system". The key is the mechanism (cords/strings) and the ritual use.

So for candidate5, the mechanism is "articulated jaw mechanism activated by a series of strings" – exactly matches. So 10.

Candidate1's snap-on is different mechanism, and puppet show context: 2.

Candidate6's pull-tab is a different mechanism (tab vs internal cords) and children's toy: 3?

Candidate8: flexible rubber jaw might move without cords, so 2.

Candidate3's magnetic attachment is different mechanism (magnetic vs cords) and educational: 2.

Candidate4 sliding panel, magic shows: 1.

So scores:

1: 2

2:0

3:2

4:1

5:10

6:3

7:0

8:2

Wait but the user said to use the full range. Maybe some can be higher or lower?

Wait candidate6's pull-tab is a form of external control (pull), but maybe the cord is internal. The examples have internal cords. The pull-tab is external, so different. But maybe it's a bit closer. So 3.

Candidate8's flexible jaw might not need cords, so 2.

Hmm, okay. Let me check again each candidate's details.

Candidate5 is spot on, so 10.

The rest:

1. Snap-on jaw (maybe fixed once on?) Puppet show: 2.

2. Static, theater: 0.

3. Magnetic jaw for education: 2.

4. Sliding panel magic:1.

5. 10.

6. Pull-tab toy:3.

7. Mardi Gras (no movement, festival):0.

8. Flexible rubber (maybe moves on its own? Or requires manipulation? If flexible allows opening, but no cords. Horror movies: 2.

Yes, that seems consistent. So the scores would be as above.
