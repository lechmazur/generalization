Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided examples and anti-examples, so I need to figure out the specific theme here. The examples are Peter Freuchen, Robert Bartlett, and Valerian Albanov. All three survived extreme Arctic or Antarctic survival situations after being stranded or shipwrecked. Freuchen was trapped in an ice cave, Bartlett survived 37 days on ice after the Karluk sank, and Albanov spent three months after abandoning ship in Franz Josef Land. The anti-examples are Adolphus Greely, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and Fridtjof Nansen. These guys also have survival stories but maybe don't fit the exact theme. Greely's expedition had a lot of suffering, Stefansson survived a long time on his own but maybe that's considered too broad, and Nansen had survival experiences but perhaps his story is more about exploration than being trapped after a ship disaster.

The task is to evaluate each candidate on a 0-10 scale based on how well they match the specific theme (surviving a specific, immediate life-threatening situation after a ship disaster or being trapped in a harsh environment) but not the broader themes that the anti-examples represent. The key here is to distinguish between those who had a specific, short-term survival ordeal versus those who might have had longer expeditions with survival elements but not exactly the same scenario.

Starting with candidate 1: Ernest Shackleton. His most famous survival is the Endurance expedition, where the ship was trapped in ice and sank, leading to a survival journey over ice and seas, culminating in the famous lifeboat voyage to South Georgia. That seems very similar to the examples given. The duration was longer (over a year), but the core is surviving after a shipwreck in a harsh environment. So maybe high score, like 8 or 9? But wait, the examples had specific durations (37 days, 3 months). Shackleton's was over a year, but maybe the key is the shipwreck leading to being stranded. So maybe 9? But let me check others first.

Candidate 2: Douglas Mawson. He had the tragic journey during the Australasian Antarctic Expedition where his two companions died, and he had to trek hundreds of miles alone with minimal supplies. That's a survival ordeal, but not exactly due to a ship sinking. His survival was on land after his companions perished. The examples included being trapped or shipwrecked. Mawson's case is similar to Freuchen being trapped, maybe? So perhaps a high score. But was he in a similar immediate disaster? His survival was more about a solo trek after a tragic expedition, not a ship sinking. Hmm. Maybe 8? Or maybe lower because it's not a ship-related incident.

Candidate 3: Robert Falcon Scott. His Terra Nova expedition's return from the South Pole, where he and his team perished. They were stranded in Antarctica after failing to reach the pole first, but they died before returning. So he didn't survive, so that's a 0? Wait, the question is about those who survived. Scott didn't survive, so definitely a 0. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the examples all are survivors. Scott's case is a failure, so 0.

Candidate 4: John Franklin. His expedition to find the Northwest Passage ended in disaster with all members dying. Franklin himself died early on, so he didn't survive. So another 0.

Candidate 5: Knud Rasmussen. He led the Fifth Thule Expedition, which was an overland trek in Greenland. He survived, but was there a specific incident where he was trapped or shipwrecked? Not that I recall. His expeditions were more about exploration overland, not surviving a ship disaster. So maybe a low score, like 2 or 3. Since the anti-examples include Stefansson and Nansen, who were explorers, maybe Rasmussen is similar to them, so he's an anti-example, hence low score.

Candidate 6: Roald Amundsen. He successfully reached the South Pole and returned. His expeditions were successful, so no survival ordeal from a disaster. Unless there's a specific incident? He did survive the Northwest Passage voyage, but that was a successful journey. So maybe 0? Or maybe 1? Not sure. Since the examples are about surviving after a ship sinking or being trapped, and Amundsen didn't have such an incident, so low.

Candidate 7: Otto Sverdrup. He led Arctic expeditions, mapping northern Canada. Survived, but again, no specific shipwreck or being trapped situation. So similar to Rasmussen, maybe 2 or 3.

Candidate 8: Ada Blackjack. She survived two years on Wrangel Island after expedition members died. That fits the theme: stranded in a harsh environment after the expedition went wrong. The others died, she survived. The examples include similar durations (months) and being stranded. So this is a strong candidate, maybe 9 or 10? The user's own example includes someone who survived 3 months, so two years is longer, but still fits the theme. So maybe 9?

Wait, but let me reassess each again. The key is the specific theme from the examples. The examples all involve being trapped or shipwrecked leading to a survival ordeal. The anti-examples are people who might have survived but in a broader context (maybe longer expeditions without the immediate disaster). 

Shackleton: His survival after the Endurance sinking is a direct example, so 9 or 10. Since the examples have durations up to 3 months, but Shackleton's was longer, but the cause (ship sinking) is there. Maybe 10? But maybe the user's examples have specific immediate disasters. Wait, the first example (Freuchen) was trapped in an ice cave, which isn't a ship disaster. The second and third are shipwrecks. So the theme could be "survived a life-threatening Arctic survival situation after being stranded due to a ship disaster or being trapped in a harsh environment". 

Ada Blackjack's case is surviving after being stranded on an island when others died, so that's a match. Shackleton's is a ship disaster leading to survival, so that's a 10? But the user's examples have different scenarios (ice cave, shipwreck, abandoning ship). So maybe Shackleton is a 10. But the anti-examples include Nansen, who had survival in Arctic but maybe without the ship disaster? Wait, Nansen tried to reach the North Pole with the Fram, but maybe that's a different scenario. 

Wait, let's check the anti-examples again. Adolphus Greely led the Lady Franklin Bay Expedition, which had a lot of suffering and survival, but they were stranded after their ship didn't return. So maybe Greely's situation is similar, but he's an anti-example. So why is he an anti-example? Maybe because his survival was part of a longer expedition where they were cut off, but not exactly a ship sinking? The ship didn't come back, so they were marooned, but not due to the ship sinking. So the key difference might be whether the survival is directly due to a ship sinking or being trapped in a specific immediate disaster. 

Greely's case was being left behind, so maybe that's a different cause. So the specific theme is survival after a ship sinking or being trapped in an ice cave (like Freuchen). So Shackleton's Endurance sinking would fit. So Shackleton gets a high score, maybe 10. 

Mawson's survival was after his companions died and he was alone on the ice, so that's being trapped in a harsh environment, similar to Freuchen. So Mawson should be a 10? Wait, but Mawson's survival was over land after a trek gone wrong, not a ship disaster. The examples include both ship and ice cave. So maybe Mawson's case fits the theme (survival in harsh environment after disaster), so he should be 10? Hmm, but the user's examples include someone who survived after abandoning ship, which is a ship disaster. Mawson's case isn't a ship issue, but a land-based survival. The first example (Freuchen) was an ice cave, so maybe land-based is okay. So maybe Mawson is a 10. Wait but then why are the anti-examples considered not fitting? Let me see.

Anti-example Vilhjalmur Stefansson survived a long time on the Arctic ice after his ship was abandoned, but maybe that's considered too broad? Stefansson actually survived for years by himself, which might be seen as a different category, like self-reliance in the Arctic, but not an immediate disaster? Or perhaps because he chose to stay behind and survived, not because of a forced stranding. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the anti-examples are explorers who had survival but in the context of broader expeditions rather than a single incident. 

So for the candidates:

1. Shackleton: Shipwreck (Endurance), survival ordeal, so 10.

2. Mawson: Solo survival after companions died, not ship-related, but similar in being trapped in harsh conditions. So maybe 9? Because it's not a ship disaster but a similar survival ordeal.

3. Scott: Died, so 0.

4. Franklin: Died, 0.

5. Rasmussen: Exploration without the specific incident, so 2.

6. Amundsen: No survival ordeal from disaster, so 1.

7. Sverdrup: Exploration, no disaster, 2.

8. Ada Blackjack: Survived 2 years after being stranded, so 9 or 10. Since her case is similar to the examples (stranded after others died), maybe 10? But the user's example had 3 months, hers was 2 years. Maybe the duration is okay as long as the cause is similar. So 10?

Wait, but the anti-examples include Stefansson, who also survived a long time. Maybe the anti-examples are because their survival was part of a longer expedition where they chose to stay, not a forced stranding? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples involve being trapped or shipwrecked leading to immediate survival struggle, while the anti-examples are explorers who survived but in the context of their expeditions without the same immediate disaster. 

So perhaps Ada's case is a good match (stranded after the others died, so forced to survive), so 10.

But the user's anti-examples include Stefansson, who survived after being abandoned by his ship, but is considered an anti-example. So maybe the difference is that in Stefansson's case, the ship was supposed to come back, but didn't, so it's a different scenario. 

Alternatively, maybe the specific theme requires being trapped or shipwrecked, leading to immediate survival, whereas the anti-examples are part of longer expeditions where survival was part of the plan. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to assign scores based on the closest fit to the examples:

1. Shackleton: 10 (shipwreck, survival ordeal)

2. Mawson: 9 (similar survival but not ship-related, but same extreme conditions)

3. Scott: 0 (died)

4. Franklin: 0 (died)

5. Rasmussen: 2 (exploration without disaster)

6. Amundsen: 1 (successful, no survival ordeal)

7. Sverdrup: 2 (similar to Rasmussen)

8. Ada: 10 (stranded after others died, similar to examples)

Wait, but the anti-example Stefansson is someone who survived after being abandoned by his ship, but he's an anti-example. So maybe Ada's case is similar to Stefansson but considered a match here. The user's examples include someone who abandoned ship (Albanov), so maybe that's acceptable. So Ada's case would be a 10. 

Alternatively, Stefansson's case might have been a different context, like he chose to stay, so maybe not forced. Ada was part of an expedition that went wrong, so forced to stay. 

So final scores:

1. Shackleton: 10

2. Mawson: 9

3. Scott: 0

4. Franklin: 0

5. Rasmussen: 2

6. Amundsen: 1

7. Sverdrup: 2

8. Ada: 10

But wait, the user's anti-examples include Nansen. Nansen tried to reach the pole with the Fram, which was an intentional ice drift, so maybe that's exploration, not a disaster. So Rasmussen and Sverdrup are similar.

But I need to ensure that the scores are nuanced. Maybe Shackleton and Ada both 10, Mawson 9, others as above. Alternatively, maybe Shackleton's longer duration (over a year) might make it a 9, but the cause is the same. 

Alternatively, let's see:

The examples have durations of 37 days, 3 months, and being trapped in an ice cave (time not specified but likely days/weeks). The anti-examples might have longer durations but not the same immediate cause. So Shackleton's year+ might be a bit outside, but the core reason (ship disaster) is there. So maybe 9 instead of 10. Ada's two years is longer than the examples, but again same cause. Hmm. Maybe both get 9. 

Alternatively, since the user's examples don't specify duration as a key factor, just the type of survival (shipwreck or being trapped), then Shackleton and Ada are 10. 

I think I'll go with:

1. 10

2. 9

3. 0

4. 0

5. 2

6. 1

7. 2

8. 10

But let me check Mawson again. His survival was over land, after his two companions died. He had to trek back with minimal supplies, suffering from frostbite and near-starvation. That's a survival ordeal similar to being trapped, so maybe 9. 

Yes, that's right. So the scores would be as above. But let me check if any other candidates might have higher or lower scores. 

Knud Rasmussen led successful expeditions without such disasters, so 2 is okay. Amundsen had no survival ordeal, so 1. 

So the final scores would be:

<number>1</number><score>10</score>

<number>2</number><score>9</score>

<number>3</number><score>0</score>

<number>4</number><score>0</score>

<number>5</number><score>2</score>

<number>6</number><score>1</score>

<number>7</number><score>2</score>

<number>8</number><score>10</score>
</think>

<number>1</number><score>10</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>2</score>
<number>8</number><score>10</score>
