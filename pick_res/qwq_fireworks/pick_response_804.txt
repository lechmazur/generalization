Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given three examples: Meiji Restoration, Norman Conquest, and Bolshevik Revolution. Then there are anti-examples like the French Revolution, Arab Spring, and American Civil War. I need to figure out the specific theme that distinguishes the examples from the anti-examples.

First, looking at the examples. The Meiji Restoration was a significant political and social movement in Japan that led to rapid modernization and the establishment of a constitutional government. The Norman Conquest was a military invasion that led to the Norman rule in England, significantly altering its political and social structure. The Bolshevik Revolution was a violent uprising that overthrew the provisional government and established a communist regime under the Bolsheviks. 

What's common among them? They all represent a major, transformative event that resulted in a fundamental change in governance or societal structure. The Meiji Restoration transformed Japan's government, the Norman Conquest replaced the existing ruling class, and the Bolshevik Revolution established a new political system. These events are all about regime change or foundational shifts in power structures through decisive actions.

Now the anti-examples. The French Revolution is a revolution, but it's listed as an anti-example here. Wait, but the Bolshevik Revolution is an example. Maybe the difference is that the French Revolution led to a more prolonged period of upheaval rather than a swift regime change? Or perhaps the French Revolution is considered a broader social movement rather than a specific event. The American Civil War was a conflict that led to the abolition of slavery but was part of an existing nation's internal struggle, not a foreign conquest or a direct overthrow of a government. The Arab Spring was a series of protests and uprisings that didn't all result in successful regime changes. So maybe the key difference is that the examples are specific, singular events that directly led to a new regime or significant structural change, whereas the anti-examples either didn't result in a clear regime change (Arab Spring in many cases), were part of an ongoing conflict (Civil War), or perhaps the French Revolution is too similar to the Bolshevik but the user wants to exclude it for some reason.

So the specific theme might be: a singular, pivotal event that results in a fundamental change in governance or societal structure, often through a decisive action (invasion, revolution, restoration) that establishes a new regime or system. The anti-examples either didn't result in such a definitive change, were part of a larger conflict, or perhaps were too broad in their scope.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. The Reagan Revolution: This refers to the political changes during Reagan's presidency, marked by conservative policies. It's more of a policy shift and political movement rather than a singular event. So maybe a 3 or 4.

2. The Vietnam War: A prolonged conflict that ended with North Vietnam's victory, leading to unification under communism. But the war itself was part of a larger conflict, not a single event that overthrew a regime. The fall of Saigon would be the event, but the war as a whole is too long. Maybe a 5?

Wait, but the Norman Conquest is a military event leading to regime change. The end of the Vietnam War could be seen as a regime change, but the war itself is the process. Maybe the candidate is the war, not the specific event. So perhaps lower, like 4.

3. The Opium Wars: These were conflicts leading to China's forced opening to trade. They resulted in significant changes, but again, the wars themselves are prolonged, and the Treaty of Nanking was the key event. The Opium Wars as a whole might be a 5 or 6 because they did lead to a fundamental change in China's sovereignty and trade policies.

4. The Industrial Revolution: A gradual process of technological and economic changes over decades. Not a single event, so definitely a 0 or 1.

5. The Cold War: A long period of geopolitical tension, not a single event leading to a regime change. So 0 or 1.

6. The Fall of Constantinople: A specific event (1453) where the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople, leading to the end of the Byzantine Empire and the establishment of Ottoman rule. This fits the examples well, as it's a decisive military conquest resulting in a new regime. So maybe 8 or 9.

7. The Partition of India: A specific event (1947) that led to the creation of India and Pakistan, ending British rule. This is a clear, pivotal event that changed the political structure. So maybe 8 or 9.

8. The Protestant Reformation: A movement that started with Martin Luther's actions, leading to the split in Christianity and significant political changes. However, it was a movement over time rather than a single event. So maybe a 5 or 6.

Wait, but the examples include the Meiji Restoration, which is a movement but is considered a singular event. The Protestant Reformation is more of a prolonged movement, so perhaps lower. Maybe 4?

Let me recheck each candidate with the theme in mind:

- The specific theme is singular, pivotal events leading to regime change or fundamental societal change through decisive actions (like invasion, revolution, restoration).

1. Reagan Revolution: Not a single event; more of a policy era. 3.

2. Vietnam War: The end led to regime change, but the war itself is too long. Maybe 4.

3. Opium Wars: Led to treaties that changed China's sovereignty. The wars themselves were events leading to that. 6.

4. Industrial Revolution: Process, 0.

5. Cold War: Process, 0.

6. Fall of Constantinople: Perfect example, 9.

7. Partition of India: Directly led to new nations, 8.

8. Protestant Reformation: Movement, not a single event. 4 or 5. Since it's a movement but did cause fundamental changes, maybe 5?

Wait, the examples include the Bolshevik Revolution, which is a revolution (a movement but with a specific event, the October Revolution). The Protestant Reformation started with Luther's 95 Theses (a specific event?), but the Reformation itself is a broader movement. So maybe a 5.

Putting it all together:

1. Reagan Revolution: 3

2. Vietnam War: 4

3. Opium Wars: 6

4. Industrial Revolution: 0

5. Cold War: 0

6. Fall of Constantinople: 9

7. Partition of India: 8

8. Protestant Reformation: 5
