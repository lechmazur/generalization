Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples (tornado, black hole, hurricane) share, while the anti-examples (windmill, turbine, propeller) do not. 

Looking at the examples: tornado, black hole, hurricane. What do they have in common? They're all natural phenomena involving some kind of rotational or cyclical movement. Tornadoes are rotating columns of air, hurricanes are large tropical storms with a rotating center, and black holes have intense gravitational pulls creating a sort of vortex effect. The key here is that they are natural, large-scale, and involve a rotating or swirling motion.

Now the anti-examples are windmill, turbine, propeller. These are all human-made devices that use rotation for a purpose (like generating power or propulsion). They involve rotation but are mechanical and not natural. So the specific theme seems to be "natural, large-scale rotating phenomena" or something similar. The anti-examples are man-made rotating devices.

Now, evaluating each candidate against that theme:

1. Ceiling fan: It's a man-made device with rotating blades, similar to a fan or propeller. So it's more like the anti-examples. So probably a low score, maybe 2 or 3.

2. Water wheel: Also a man-made device, uses water flow to rotate. Again, mechanical and not natural. Maybe a 1 or 2.

3. Spinning top: A toy that spins. Man-made, small-scale. Not natural. Maybe 1.

4. Blender: Definitely a human-made appliance with rotating parts. So low score, maybe 0 or 1.

5. Gyroscope: A device for measuring or maintaining orientation, uses rotation. Again, man-made. Maybe 1.

6. Whirlpool: Hmm, whirlpools can be natural, like in oceans or rivers. They are rotating bodies of water. That fits the natural, rotating theme. So maybe a 7 or 8?

7. Helicopter rotor: Man-made, part of an aircraft. Definitely in the anti-example category. So 0 or 1.

8. Food processor: Another appliance with rotating blades. So 0 or 1.

Wait, but whirlpool could be tricky. Some whirlpools are natural, others might be man-made (like in a bathtub). But the examples given were tornado, hurricane, black holeâ€”all natural. So whirlpool as a natural phenomenon would fit. So maybe 8?

But maybe there's a nuance. Black hole is space, tornado and hurricane are atmospheric. A whirlpool is in water. So still a natural rotating phenomenon. So 8 seems okay.

Let me check each again:

1. Ceiling fan: Definitely man-made. 2.

2. Water wheel: Man-made, 1.

3. Spinning top: 1.

4. Blender: 0.

5. Gyroscope: 1.

6. Whirlpool: 8.

7. Helicopter rotor: 0.

8. Food processor: 0.

Wait, but the anti-examples are windmill, turbine, propeller. So maybe some of these candidates are similar to those. Ceiling fan is like a small propeller. Water wheel is like a turbine. So they are in the same category as the anti-examples. So their scores should be low.

Spinning top is a toy, so not even a device for energy, but still man-made rotating object. Maybe a 1.

Whirlpool is the only one that's a natural phenomenon. So 8 or 9?

Black hole is a cosmic phenomenon, tornado and hurricane are meteorological. Whirlpool is oceanic, so fits the natural rotating theme. So maybe 9?

Wait, but maybe there's a difference in scale. Hurricanes and tornadoes are huge, but whirlpools can vary in size. A maelstrom is a large whirlpool, but not all are as big. Still, I think it's a better fit than the others. So 8 or 9. Let's say 8.

So the scores would be:

1. Ceiling fan: 2

2. Water wheel: 1

3. Spinning top: 1

4. Blender: 0

5. Gyroscope: 1

6. Whirlpool: 8

7. Helicopter rotor: 0

8. Food processor: 0

Wait, but maybe some others have some aspects. Let me think again.

Helicopter rotor is definitely man-made, so 0.

Gyroscope is a device, so 1.

Blender and food processor are both appliances with rotating blades, so 0.

Spinning top: maybe 1.

Water wheel is a device to harness energy, so 1.

Ceiling fan is a device, so 2 because it's similar to a propeller (anti-example), which is a 0? Wait the anti-examples are 0, but the user said to use the full range. Wait, the anti-examples are given as not matching the specific theme but could match broader ones. So the candidates should be scored on how well they match the specific theme (natural large-scale rotating phenomena). 

Thus, only whirlpool is a natural rotating phenomenon. So 8 or 9. Maybe 8. The others are all man-made, so 0-2. Let me adjust:

1. Ceiling fan: 1 (since it's a rotating device but not natural)

Wait, but the anti-examples are windmill, turbine, propeller. Windmill and turbine are energy devices, propeller is for propulsion. The ceiling fan is a different use but still a rotating device. So maybe it's in the same category as anti-examples, so 1.

Water wheel: similar to turbine, so 1.

Spinning top: 0? Or 1? It's a toy, not an energy device, but still man-made rotation. Maybe 1.

Gyroscope: 1.

So:

1. 1

2. 1

3. 1

4. 0

5. 1

6. 8

7. 0

8. 0

Hmm, but the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe I need to differentiate more. Let's see:

Whirlpool is the best match, so 8 or 9. Let's say 8.

Others:

Helicopter rotor: 0

Food processor: 0

Blender: 0

Gyroscope: maybe 1 because it's a rotating object but not for energy, but still mechanical. 

Spinning top: 1.

Ceiling fan: 2, since it's a bit closer to a propeller, which is an anti-example (maybe the anti-examples are 0, so ceiling fan is a step above? Not sure, but to use the full range, perhaps give some variation.

Alternatively, maybe ceiling fan is 2 because it's a rotating device but not as directly like the anti-examples (propeller is for movement, ceiling fan for airflow). But still man-made. 

Alternatively, maybe water wheel is 2 because it's a water-based rotating device, but still man-made.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to assign scores with more granularity:

1. Ceiling fan: 2 (slightly more than others because it's a rotating air device, similar to a fan but not in the anti-examples directly)

2. Water wheel: 1 (man-made, energy device)

3. Spinning top: 1 (toy, rotation but not energy)

4. Blender: 0 (completely appliance, no natural aspect)

5. Gyroscope: 1 (device, rotation for orientation)

6. Whirlpool: 8 (natural, rotating water)

7. Helicopter rotor: 0 (clearly man-made propulsion)

8. Food processor: 0 (appliance)

That uses 0,1,2,8. Maybe for others:

Wait, maybe the water wheel could be 2 as well? Since it's a wheel, like a water wheel vs turbine. But turbine is an anti-example. Hmm. Maybe 1 is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the spinning top is 0 because it's a toy, but others like gyroscope are 1. 

I think this is the best I can do. Let's go with that.
