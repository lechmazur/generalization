Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to figure out the specific theme they're pointing to. The examples are Elizabeth Eckford in 1957, Tank Man in Tiananmen Square 1989, and James Meredith in 1962. All three of these are instances where an individual or small group directly confronts authority or institutionalized oppression in a very visible, symbolic act. They're all moments of physical, direct defiance where the person is facing immediate opposition or danger, often captured in iconic images.

Now the anti-examples are the first Woolworth's sit-in, Susan B. Anthony voting illegally, and the Storming of the Bastille. The sit-in was a group action, part of a broader movement but still a direct action. Susan B. Anthony's voting was an individual act but maybe seen as more covert or not an immediate confrontation. The Storming of the Bastille is a collective uprising, more of a violent overthrow rather than a solitary stand. So the anti-examples are either group actions, less about the individual's stand against immediate authority, or more about collective revolt or symbolic acts that aren't the same as the examples.

So the specific theme here is probably individual or small group confrontation with authority in a high-stakes, visually potent moment where the individual is directly facing down an opposing force. The key elements are the individual vs. oppressive system, a pivotal moment of defiance that's often captured in a single iconic image, and the immediate threat or resistance from authorities.

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Gandhi's Salt March: This was a mass movement led by Gandhi, but it's a large group action. While Gandhi was a central figure, it's more about a collective movement rather than a single individual facing down authority in a direct confrontation. So maybe lower score, like a 4 or 5.

2. Montgomery Bus Boycott: Another large-scale, organized protest over a long period. Not a single moment of individual defiance. So probably a 2 or 3.

3. Stonewall Riots: A spontaneous uprising by the LGBTQ+ community against police. It's a group action, though maybe more chaotic. Not an individual standing alone. Maybe a 3 or 4.

4. Rosa Parks refusing her seat: This is an individual act of defiance against segregation. She faced immediate arrest, and her action was pivotal. This seems very close to the examples. Maybe an 8 or 9.

5. Women's Suffrage Parade 1913: A organized march, group action. While important, not an individual facing down authority in a single moment. Maybe a 3 or 4.

6. Fall of Berlin Wall: A symbolic event, but more about the collapse of a system rather than an act of defiance. People were celebrating its fall, so maybe a 1 or 2.

7. Boston Tea Party: A group act of protest (though disguised), but more of a symbolic act of rebellion. Not an individual vs authority. Maybe a 2 or 3.

8. Selma to Montgomery March: A large organized march, leading to events like Bloody Sunday. Again, collective action. Maybe a 3 or 4.

Wait, let me check again. The examples are all singular moments where the individual is in direct confrontation. So Rosa Parks is a very strong candidate. The Montgomery Bus Boycott is the response, but not the individual act. The Salt March was a march led by Gandhi, but involved many people. The Selma march was a group action. The Stonewall riots were a riot, so group but spontaneous. The Boston Tea Party was a group action, secret. The Women's Parade is a group event. So Rosa Parks is the closest. Then maybe the Selma march is a group but part of a series of confrontations, but not a single individual. The Tank Man is an individual. So Rosa Parks would be high, maybe 9. The others would be lower. The Montgomery Bus Boycott is a 2. The Stonewall riots might be a 3 because it was a spontaneous group resistance but not an individual. Boston Tea Party is a group act, so 2. Fall of Berlin Wall is 0 or 1. Women's Parade is 3. Salt March maybe 4 because it's led by an individual but with many followers. Selma march maybe 4. Let me adjust:

1. Gandhi's Salt March: 4 (because Gandhi was central but it's a mass movement)
2. Montgomery Bus Boycott: 2 (organised but not individual confrontation)
3. Stonewall: 3 (group but a spontaneous uprising)
4. Rosa Parks: 9 (individual facing immediate arrest, pivotal moment)
5. Women's Parade: 3 (group march)
6. Berlin Wall: 1 (collapse, not an act of defiance)
7. Boston Tea Party: 2 (group act of protest)
8. Selma March: 4 (large group, but part of a series of confrontations, maybe less about the individual)
