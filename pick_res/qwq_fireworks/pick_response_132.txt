Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples: Celtic spiral knot, Mandala pattern, and Buddhist dharma wheel. 

Looking at these, they all seem to be symbolic, intricate designs with spiritual or cultural significance. The Celtic spiral knot is a complex interlaced pattern, Mandalas are spiritual symbols in Hinduism and Buddhism, often geometric, and the Dharma wheel is a Buddhist symbol representing the teaching of Buddha. So the common thread here is probably sacred or spiritual symbols that are geometric or interlaced, often with a cultural or religious origin.

Now the anti-examples are spiral galaxy, nautilus shell, and hurricane symbol. These are natural phenomena or symbols representing natural things. The galaxy and nautilus shell are naturally occurring spirals, and a hurricane symbol might be a weather-related icon. The key here is that the anti-examples are natural or scientific representations rather than cultural or religious symbols. 

So the specific theme is likely sacred or culturally significant geometric/spiral symbols, not natural ones. 

Now evaluating each candidate:

1. **Compass rose**: This is a navigational tool on maps and charts. It's a symbol but more functional and secular. Doesn't have the spiritual/cultural significance. Probably a low score, maybe 2 or 3.

2. **Yin Yang symbol**: This is a Taoist symbol representing duality and harmony. It's definitely a spiritual/cultural symbol with a circular design. This should be a high score, maybe 8 or 9.

3. **Spiral staircase**: A physical structure. While it has a spiral, it's an architectural element, not a symbolic or cultural design. Probably a 1 or 2.

4. **Ouroboros symbol**: An ancient symbol of a snake eating its tail, representing cycles. It's a spiritual/cultural symbol, often found in alchemy and mythology. So this would be a good match, maybe 7 or 8.

5. **Pinwheel**: A toy or a simple geometric shape. It's a spiral-like design but not symbolic in a spiritual/cultural context. Maybe 3 or 4.

6. **Ferris wheel**: A carnival ride. Again, a circular structure but functional, not symbolic. Probably 1 or 2.

7. **Clock face**: Functional object, tells time. Though circular, it's not a spiritual symbol. Maybe 2.

8. **Crop circle**: These are patterns in fields, sometimes considered mysterious but not tied to a specific culture's sacred symbols. They might be natural or man-made, not traditional. Maybe a 4 or 5, but since they can be intricate and sometimes spiral-like, but not culturally sacred, so maybe 3 or 4.

Wait, let me reassess. The anti-examples include natural things, so crop circles might be considered more natural/mysterious but not part of a specific culture's symbolism. So maybe lower. 

Adjusting scores:

1. Compass rose: 2 (functional, secular)
2. Yin Yang: 9 (matches perfectly)
3. Spiral staircase: 1 (functional)
4. Ouroboros: 8 (spiritual symbol)
5. Pinwheel: 3 (simple, not symbolic)
6. Ferris wheel: 1 (functional)
7. Clock face: 2 (functional)
8. Crop circle: 3 or 4? Maybe 3 since they are not tied to a specific culture's sacred symbols, just patterns. 

Hmm, maybe crop circles could be a 4 if they have some symbolic meaning in modern culture, but since they aren't established religious or traditional symbols, probably a 3. 

So final scores would be:

1. 2
2. 9
3. 1
4. 8
5. 3
6. 1
7. 2
8. 3

Wait, but the user wants the scores to use the full range. Let me see if I can spread them more. Maybe the Ouroboros is 8, Yin Yang 9, others accordingly. Maybe crop circle is 4? Since it's a pattern but not sacred. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the compass rose could be a 3 if it's a navigational symbol but not spiritual. Hmm. 

Alternatively, the clock face might be 2, Ferris wheel 1, spiral staircase 1. 

I think this is a reasonable spread.
