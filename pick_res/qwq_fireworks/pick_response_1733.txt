Okay, let's see. The user provided examples of a specific theme and some anti-examples. The task is to score each candidate on how well they fit the specific theme, not the broader or related ones. The examples given are Saltuk Bugra Wrestling Festival, Kirkpinar Oil Wrestling Festival, and Kırkpınar Yağlı Güreşleri. All of these are wrestling festivals, specifically oil wrestling, and they have names that include "Yağlı Güreş" or "Oil Wrestling" in their titles. 

The anti-examples are Camel wrestling, Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, and Istanbul Marathon. These are either different types of sports (cycling, marathon) or different forms of animal sports (camel wrestling) that don't fit the exact theme but might be related in a broader sense, like other Turkish festivals or sports events.

So the specific theme here seems to be "Turkish oil wrestling festivals" or "oil wrestling festivals named after locations with historical significance." The key elements are oil wrestling, traditional festivals, and possibly the use of "Yağlı Güreş" in the name.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Hidrellez celebrations: Hidrellez is a traditional spring celebration in Turkey and some neighboring countries. It's more of a cultural festival, not specifically wrestling. So probably a low score.

2. Alanya International Triathlon: Triathlon is a sport event involving swimming, cycling, and running. The anti-examples include cycling and marathon, so this would be a broader sports event, not oil wrestling. Low score.

3. Tarihi Elmalı Yağlı Güreşleri: "Yağlı Güreşleri" translates to oil wrestling. The word "Tarihi" means historical. This looks exactly like the examples given. So this should be a high score, maybe a 10?

4. Mesir Macunu Festival: This is a historical festival in Turkey, associated with a spice paste and Suleymaniye Mosque. It's a cultural event with religious significance, not wrestling. So low score.

5. Edirne Kakava Festival: Edirne is a city in Turkey. Kakava might refer to something specific. Wait, Kakava is actually a type of wrestling in some regions? Or maybe it's a local festival. Need to check. Alternatively, maybe it's a food festival? Not sure, but if it's not oil wrestling, then lower. But maybe Edirne is connected to Kirkpinar, which is in Edirne? Wait, Kirkpinar Oil Wrestling is held in Edirne. Kakava might be a part of that? Wait, the Kirkpinar festival is in Edirne. Maybe Kakava is a related event? Hmm, not sure. Need to think. Alternatively, "Kakava" could be a typo or different term. Maybe it's a local festival but not oil wrestling. Maybe a 3 or 4?

6. Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day: This is a national holiday in Turkey, celebrating Atatürk and promoting sports. It's a general sports day, not a specific wrestling festival. So low score, maybe 1 or 2.

7. Konya Mevlana Festival: The Mevlana Festival is related to the whirling dervishes and the poet Rumi. It's a cultural and spiritual event, not wrestling. So low score.

8. Turkish Grand Prix (Formula 1): Definitely a motorsport event. The anti-examples include a cycling tour and marathon, so this is a broader sports event. Score 0 or 1.

Wait, but let me confirm each candidate again. 

For candidate 3: "Tarihi Elmalı Yağlı Güreşleri" – "Yağlı" is oil, "Güreşleri" is wrestling. So this is definitely an oil wrestling event. The examples all have "Yağlı" or "Oil Wrestling" in the name, so this should be a 10.

Candidate 5: "Edirne Kakava Festival". Wait, maybe Kakava is a type of wrestling? Let me think. Kirkpinar is in Edirne. Maybe Kakava is part of the same festival? Or maybe Kakava is another term. Alternatively, perhaps Kakava is a local term for oil wrestling in Edirne. If so, then maybe this is a good match. Alternatively, maybe Kakava refers to something else. Maybe I should check. But since I can't look it up, I have to go by the name. Since it's in Edirne, where Kirkpinar is held, maybe it's a related festival. But the name doesn't include "Yağlı Güreş", so maybe it's a different type. Alternatively, maybe "Kakava" is a local term for oil wrestling. But without knowing, perhaps I should give it a moderate score. Maybe a 7? Or 6?

Alternatively, perhaps "Kakava" is a different event. Maybe a food festival? Not sure. Hmm. Let me think again. Since the examples are all about oil wrestling festivals, the key is the presence of oil wrestling. So if the candidate's name includes "Yağlı Güreş", then it's a direct hit. For Edirne Kakava Festival, since it's in Edirne, which is the site of Kirkpinar, maybe it's part of the same tradition but called differently. Alternatively, maybe "Kakava" is a local term. But without the key terms, maybe it's a bit lower. Maybe a 5 or 6?

Alternatively, maybe the user considers that festivals in Edirne related to Kirkpinar would still count. But the name doesn't mention oil wrestling, so perhaps it's not a direct match. So maybe a 5?

Candidate 5: Let me think again. The Kirkpinar is in Edirne. Maybe the Kakava Festival is a different event there. Maybe it's a food festival. So maybe a low score. Hmm, this is tricky. Alternatively, maybe Kakava is a type of wrestling. Wait, "Kakava" in Turkish could mean something else. Maybe a type of wrestling move? Or perhaps it's a local variation. Alternatively, maybe it's a misspelling. Maybe "Kakava" is "Yağlı" in another form. Not sure. Since the name doesn't include the key terms, I'll have to assume it's not a direct match. So maybe a 3?

Alternatively, maybe it's a local wrestling event without the oil term, so lower. Hmm. I think I'll go with 5 for Edirne Kakava, but not sure.

Now, candidate 5's score might be 5, but perhaps others are clearer.

Let me list them again:

1. Hidrellez: 0 or 1? Since it's a cultural festival not wrestling. 1.

2. Alanya Triathlon: anti-example is Istanbul Marathon and Presidential Cycling, so Triathlon is similar, so 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

3. Tarihi Elmalı Yağlı Güreşleri: 10.

4. Mesir Macunu: cultural, 0 or 1. 1.

5. Edirne Kakava: maybe 4 or 5. Let's say 5.

6. Atatürk Commemoration: 0 or 1. 1.

7. Konya Mevlana: cultural, 0 or 1. 1.

8. Turkish GP: 0.

Wait but the user wants the scores to use the full range, so maybe adjust a bit. Let me check again.

Wait, the anti-examples include Camel Wrestling, which is a wrestling type but not oil. So camel wrestling is an anti-example. So if a candidate is wrestling but not oil, it would be lower.

So for candidate 5, if it's a wrestling festival but not oil, it would be lower than 10 but higher than camel wrestling. But since the user's anti-examples include camel wrestling as an anti-example, then a wrestling event without oil would still be a better match than camel wrestling but not the exact theme. Wait, but the user's anti-examples are supposed to be not matching the specific theme. So the specific theme is oil wrestling festivals. So any oil wrestling is a match, non-oil wrestling would be lower but maybe some points?

Wait, the examples all have oil wrestling (Yağlı Güreş). The anti-examples include camel wrestling (which is wrestling but not oil). So camel wrestling is an anti-example because it's wrestling but not oil. So, if a candidate is a wrestling festival but not oil, it would be an anti-example and thus get a low score. But the user's anti-examples include camel wrestling, so other wrestling types are anti-examples. Therefore, candidate 5, if it's a wrestling festival but not oil, would be an anti-example and thus low. But if it's oil, then high.

Since the name of candidate 5 is "Edirne Kakava Festival" – if "Kakava" is not oil wrestling, then it's a wrestling festival but not oil, so a low score, like 2.

Alternatively, perhaps "Kakava" refers to a type of oil wrestling. Since Kirkpinar is in Edirne, perhaps Kakava is part of that. Maybe the festival is the same as Kirkpinar but another name? Wait, no, Kirkpinar is the main one. Maybe Kakava is a different event. Maybe it's a food festival. Since the name doesn't have "Yağlı", it's safer to assume it's not oil wrestling. So maybe a 2.

Alternatively, maybe the user considers that festivals in Edirne related to wrestling count even without the term, but the examples all have the term. So to be safe, 2.

So revising:

1. Hidrellez: 1

2. Alanya Triathlon: 0 (since it's a triathlon, like the anti-examples)

3. Tarihi Elmalı Yağlı Güreşleri: 10

4. Mesir Macunu: 0

5. Edirne Kakava: 2

6. Atatürk Commemoration: 0

7. Konya Mevlana: 0

8. Turkish GP: 0

Wait but the user wants the scores to use the full range, but maybe some can be in between. Let me see again:

Looking for any possible points.

Hidrellez is a big festival, but not wrestling. So 1.

Alanya International Triathlon is a sport event, but not wrestling, so 0.

Edirne Kakava: maybe 2.

Mesir Macunu: cultural, 0.

Atatürk's day is about sports but general, so maybe 1.

Konya Mevlana is cultural, 0.

Turkish GP is 0.

But the user said to use the full range. Hmm. Maybe some can have higher scores. Wait, maybe the Mevlana Festival has some wrestling? Unlikely. Probably not. So 0.

Alternatively, maybe the Edirne Kakava is a local event that's a wrestling festival but not oil. Since camel wrestling is an anti-example, then it's similar, so 1 or 2.

Alternatively, maybe the Mevlana Festival has some traditional sports, but not wrestling. Probably 0.

So:

1. 1

2. 0

3. 10

4. 0

5. 2

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

But need to spread more. Let me see:

The user wants scores from 0-10, so maybe some can get 3 or 4.

Wait, candidate 5: If it's a wrestling event in Edirne, maybe it's a regional wrestling but not oil. Since Kirkpinar is in Edirne and is oil, maybe Kakava is a different event but still wrestling. But not oil. So similar to camel wrestling (anti-example), so 1 or 2.

Alternatively, maybe it's a food festival. Then 0.

Hmm. Let me proceed with the above.

Now, candidate 7: Konya Mevlana Festival. It's a big cultural event, but not wrestling. So 0.

Candidate 6: Atatürk Youth and Sports Day. It's a national holiday, and they have sports events, but it's not a festival focused on oil wrestling. So maybe 1.

So the scores would be:

1. 1

2. 0

3. 10

4. 0

5. 2

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

But need to check if any can have higher scores. Let me think again.

Candidate 5: Edirne Kakava Festival. Maybe Kakava is a type of wrestling? If so, but not oil, then similar to camel wrestling. So 1.

Alternatively, maybe it's a food festival, so 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the user considers that festivals in Edirne related to the area where Kirkpinar is held get some points, but without oil, it's still low. So 2.

Alternatively, maybe Kakava is a misspelling or alternative term. Maybe "Yağlı" is in another form. Not sure. If unsure, maybe 3?

Alternatively, to use the full range, maybe give some candidates middle scores.

Alternatively, the user's examples are all oil wrestling festivals, so the exact theme is oil wrestling festivals. So only those with "Yağlı Güreş" in the name (like candidate 3) get 10. Others that are wrestling but not oil get lower, but camel wrestling is an anti-example, so those would be 1 or 2. Other non-wrestling get 0 or 1.

So:

Candidate 5: If it's a wrestling festival but not oil, maybe 2.

Candidate 1 (Hidrellez): 1.

Candidate 6 (Atatürk Day): 1.

Others are 0 except 3 is 10.

So the scores would be:

1. 1

2. 0

3. 10

4. 0

5. 2

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

That uses 0,1,2,10. But the user wants the full range. Maybe need to adjust.

Wait, maybe candidate 5 is a better match? Let me think again. If "Kakava" is a type of oil wrestling, then maybe 10? But since the name doesn't include "Yağlı", maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's the same as Kirkpinar but another name. But Kirkpinar is the main one. So maybe 5 is 0.

Alternatively, perhaps Kakava is a local term for oil wrestling. If so, then maybe 8 or 9. But without knowing, it's risky. Since the user's examples have the explicit term, perhaps it's safer to assume that unless the name includes "Yağlı", it's not a direct match. So 2.

Hmm. I think that's the best I can do. Let's proceed with that.
