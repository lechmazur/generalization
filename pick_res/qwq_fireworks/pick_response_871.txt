Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided examples and anti-examples, and I need to figure out the specific theme they're looking for. Let me start by analyzing the examples given:

The Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland: This was a peace deal ending the Troubles, involving political parties and addressing the conflict between unionists and nationalists.

South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission: A process to deal with past human rights abuses through confession and amnesty rather than punishment.

The Salt March by Gandhi: A nonviolent protest against British salt laws, leading to increased independence movement momentum.

So, the common theme here seems to be processes or actions that involve nonviolent resolution, reconciliation, or addressing historical injustices through peaceful means, often involving some form of compromise or restorative justice. 

Now, the anti-examples are the Oslo Accords, Cuban Missile Crisis resolution, and Camp David Accords. The Oslo Accords were peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians but are controversial and didn't lead to lasting peace. The Cuban Missile Crisis resolution was a high-stakes negotiation but more of a crisis management between superpowers, not a reconciliation process. Camp David Accords were about Egypt and Israel peace, but similar to Oslo in being a treaty but maybe not the same kind of reconciliation or nonviolent movement as the examples.

So the key differences might be that the anti-examples are treaties or agreements that are more about conflict resolution between states, possibly involving more geopolitical power plays, whereas the examples are more about societal reconciliation, addressing past wrongs, or nonviolent mass movements leading to change.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. UN peacekeeping missions: These are international military and political missions to help countries navigate the difficult path from conflict to peace. They support peace processes but aren't themselves a reconciliation process or a nonviolent movement. So maybe a 3 or 4? They are related to peace but not exactly the same as the examples.

2. Nuremberg Trials: These were war crime tribunals after WWII. They focused on punishment rather than reconciliation or amnesty. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was about amnesty, so this is more punitive. So maybe a low score, like 2? But maybe some connection to addressing past injustices, but not through reconciliation.

3. Helsinki Accords: This was a treaty during the Cold War addressing security and human rights. It included some provisions for human rights which activists used later, but the accord itself was a geopolitical agreement. So maybe a 4? Not exactly a reconciliation process but has elements of addressing issues through international agreement.

4. Dayton Agreement: Ended the Bosnian War, similar to Good Friday in being a peace agreement. It was a negotiated settlement between warring factions. This seems closer. Maybe a 7 or 8? It's a peace agreement but perhaps not as focused on reconciliation as the GFA. But it's a direct peace deal ending a conflict, so maybe similar to the examples. Hmm, the anti-examples include Camp David and Oslo, which are similar in being accords. But Dayton is more about ending an active conflict through international mediation. Maybe a 7?

5. Fall of Berlin Wall via peaceful protests: This was a nonviolent movement leading to the end of a divided Germany. Similar to the Salt March as a nonviolent protest leading to significant change. That's a strong match. Maybe a 9? The examples included a nonviolent march (Salt) and reconciliation (GFA, TRC). The fall of the wall was a result of protests and peaceful actions, so 9?

6. Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: A treaty to prevent spread of nuclear weapons. It's an international agreement but not related to reconciliation or nonviolent movements against oppression. More of a security pact. So maybe 1 or 2.

7. Paris Peace Accords: The 1973 agreement ending the Vietnam War. Similar to Dayton, it's a peace treaty. But the Camp David and Oslo are anti-examples. So maybe a 5? It's a peace agreement but not focused on reconciliation or restorative justice. The Paris Accords were more about ceasefire and withdrawal, so perhaps a 4?

8. League of Nations formation: An international organization aimed at preventing war. It's a structural initiative, not a reconciliation process or nonviolent movement. So maybe a 2?

Wait, let me recheck each:

1. UN peacekeeping: They support peace but aren't an example of a reconciliation process. Maybe 3.

2. Nuremberg: Punitive, not restorative. 1.

3. Helsinki: More about Cold War balance, but human rights aspects. Maybe 4.

4. Dayton: Direct peace agreement ending war, similar to GFA. Maybe 7.

5. Berlin Wall: Nonviolent, leading to reunification. 9.

6. NPT: Not related. 1.

7. Paris Peace: Treaty ending war, but like Oslo, maybe 4.

8. League of Nations: 2.

Hmm, but the examples include both reconciliation (TRC, GFA) and a nonviolent movement (Salt March). The candidates need to fit either of those aspects. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a result of protests (nonviolent), so that's a strong match. The Dayton Agreement is a peace agreement, like GFA, so that's a good fit. The Nuremberg Trials are about punishment, so not the same. The Paris Peace Accords are a treaty but not necessarily reconciliation. 

So maybe adjust scores:

1. UN missions: 3 (they facilitate but aren't the actual process)

2. Nuremberg: 1 (punishment vs reconciliation)

3. Helsinki: 4 (human rights but not reconciliation)

4. Dayton: 8 (similar to GFA as a peace deal ending conflict through negotiation, maybe higher)

5. Berlin Wall: 9 (nonviolent leading to change, like Salt March)

6. NPT: 1 (no)

7. Paris: 5 (peace treaty but not reconciliation focused)

8. League: 2

Wait, perhaps Dayton is an 8? Since GFA is an example, and Dayton is similar as a peace agreement ending a conflict with international mediation, maybe even higher. The anti-examples include Camp David and Oslo, which are also accords. The user said anti-examples are not exact matches but follow broader themes. So perhaps Dayton is a better fit than Oslo, so maybe 8.

Similarly, the Paris Peace Accords might be like the examples but less so. Let me think. The GFA involved political agreement with both sides, the TRC was about truth and reconciliation, and the Salt March was nonviolent protest. The Paris Accords were more about ceasefire and US withdrawal, so less about reconciliation. So 4 or 5.

I think I have a better idea now. Let me assign the scores accordingly.
