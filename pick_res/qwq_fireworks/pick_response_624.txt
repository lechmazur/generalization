Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples provided are:

1. A selenite tower with a small depression carved in the top to hold loose incense.
2. An amethyst geode split and hollowed out to hold a tealight candle.
3. A calcite cluster with a naturally formed cavity used as a container for burning fragrant herbs.

Looking at these, the common elements seem to be:

- **Natural Stones/Minerals**: All examples use minerals like selenite, amethyst geode, and calcite.
- **Natural or Carved Cavities**: Each item has a cavity either naturally formed or carved to serve a purpose (holding incense, candles, herbs).
- **Functional Use as a Container for Burning/Aromatherapy**: The cavities are specifically used to hold something that's burned (incense, herbs) or provides light/fragrance (tealight).

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. A glass candle holder. (Not a natural stone, made of glass.)
2. An amethyst geode. (Just the geode without being hollowed or used as a container.)
3. A ceramic incense burner. (Man-made ceramic, not a natural mineral.)

So the key differences here are that the anti-examples either use non-natural materials, are natural minerals but not modified to have a cavity for a specific function, or are man-made containers not from minerals.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. **A Himalayan salt lamp.**  
   - Made of natural salt, but it's typically a solid block with a bulb inside. It doesn't have a cavity for holding something to burn. It's a light, not a container. So maybe a 2 or 3? But maybe lower because it's not a container for burning items.

2. **A scented candle.**  
   - Not a natural stone/mineral. It's wax. So definitely an anti-example. Score 0 or 1.

3. **A quartz point.**  
   - Natural mineral (quartz), but it doesn't have a cavity or depression. Unless it's a specific type with a natural cavity, but generally quartz points are pointed and solid. So maybe 1 or 2.

4. **A wooden smudge stick holder.**  
   - Made of wood, not a mineral. So not matching the material. Score 0 or 1.

5. **A calcite crystal.**  
   - Natural calcite, but unless it has a cavity, it's just a crystal. The example had a calcite cluster with a natural cavity. If this is just a single crystal without a cavity, then maybe 1 or 2. But if it's a cluster, maybe higher. The description is vague, so probably lower.

6. **A selenite wand.**  
   - Selenite is part of the original examples, but a wand is a solid piece, not a tower with a depression. So it's a natural mineral but lacks the cavity. Maybe 1 or 2.

7. **A Himalayan salt lamp carved into a bowl shape, designed to hold incense cones.**  
   - Now this combines natural salt (Himalayan) with a carved cavity (bowl) to hold incense. This matches the theme exactly. So 10?

Wait, but the original examples used minerals with either natural or carved cavities. Since this is carved into a bowl specifically to hold incense, it's a strong match. Maybe 9 or 10. The first example was a selenite tower with a carved depression. So similar. Maybe 10 is okay.

8. **A metal oil diffuser.**  
   - Metal is not a natural mineral. So 0 or 1.

Wait, but let me check again:

The theme requires:

- Natural mineral/stone
- Has a cavity (natural or carved) to hold something that's burned or used for fragrance.

So:

1. Himalayan salt lamp: Natural (salt), but cavity? Typically, salt lamps are solid with a bulb inside. They don't have a cavity to hold incense or herbs. So no. So 1 or 2.

2. Scented candle: Not natural mineral. 0.

3. Quartz point: Natural, but no cavity. 1.

4. Wooden holder: Not mineral. 0.

5. Calcite crystal: Unless it's a cluster with a cavity, but as a single crystal, no. 1.

6. Selenite wand: Selenite, but no cavity. 1.

7. Salt lamp bowl for incense: Perfect match. 10.

8. Metal diffuser: Not mineral. 0.

Wait, but the anti-examples include a ceramic incense burner. The key is that the container must be made from a natural mineral, either with a natural cavity or carved. So the metal one is 0, ceramic is anti-example (so 0 here too). 

But let me check the candidates again. The 7th candidate is a carved Himalayan salt lamp as a bowl for incense. Since Himalayan salt is a natural material, and it's carved into a bowl (like the selenite tower was carved), and used to hold incense, this is spot on. So 10.

The rest:

1. Himalayan salt lamp (non-bowl) is 2 because it's natural but not a container for burning items. 

Wait, the first example's selenite tower has a depression for incense. The salt lamp, even if it's a solid, isn't used for that. So maybe 1 or 2.

Hmm, maybe 2.

Quartz point (3) is 1, since it's natural but no cavity.

Calcite crystal (5) is same as quartz, so 1.

Selenite wand (6) is natural but no cavity, so 1.

Wooden holder (4) is 0.

Metal diffuser (8) is 0.

Scented candle (2) is 0.

So the scores would be:

1: 2

2: 0

3: 1

4: 0

5: 1

6: 1

7: 10

8: 0

Wait, but the user wants a range from 0-10, and to use the full range. Maybe some candidates can get higher scores?

Wait let's think again. For example, the calcite crystal (5): if it's a cluster, maybe it has a natural cavity? The original example was a calcite cluster with a natural cavity. If the candidate is just a "calcite crystal" which might be a single crystal, then no. But if it's a cluster, then maybe higher. But the description says "calcite crystal" which is singular. So 1.

The selenite wand (6): if it's a wand, which is a solid piece, but maybe some wands have a natural indentation? Unlikely. So 1.

Quartz point (3) is definitely 1.

Himalayan salt lamp (1) is 2 because it's made of natural salt, but not a container for burning. It's a lamp with a bulb, so maybe a 2 since it's natural but not exactly the function.

Wait, maybe the first example's function is to hold something that's burned (incense, herbs, candle). The salt lamp uses a bulb, which is electric, not burning. So not matching the function. So maybe 1?

Hmm, perhaps:

1: 1

2:0

3:1

4:0

5:1

6:1

7:10

8:0

But maybe the selenite wand (6) could be a 2 if it's possible that the wand is used in a way that someone might place something in it? But no, the theme requires a cavity to hold the burning item. A wand is just a pointed piece. So 1.

Alternatively, maybe the selenite tower is a tower shape, while a wand is a different shape but still selenite. Since the wand is a solid, no cavity, so 1.

The 7th candidate is the only perfect match at 10. The others are lower.

Wait, let me check if any others might be higher. For example, the calcite crystal (5). If the candidate is a calcite cluster (plural) but the description says "calcite crystal" (singular), so probably 1.

Okay, proceeding with that in mind.
