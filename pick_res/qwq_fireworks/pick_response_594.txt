Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are:

- Crocheted shopping bag for bulk rice
- Woven polypropylene sandbag
- Burlap sack of coffee beans

Looking at these, they all seem to be about bags or containers made from specific materials (crocheted, woven polypropylene, burlap) that are used to hold bulk items like rice, sand, or coffee beans. The key points here might be:

1. The container is a bag or sack made from a specific woven or flexible material.
2. The contents are bulk items, possibly agricultural or raw materials.
3. The container is designed for holding these items in a way that's practical, maybe for storage or transport.

Now the anti-examples are:

- Metal bucket of gravel
- Silo
- Dump truck

These don't fit the specific theme. The metal bucket is a rigid container, the silo is a large structure, and the dump truck is a vehicle. So the anti-examples are more about rigid containers, large structures, or vehicles used for transport, which are different from the flexible, woven sacks in the examples.

So the specific theme is likely: **Flexible, woven or hand-made bags/sacks made from materials like burlap, polypropylene, or crochet, used to hold bulk agricultural or similar products.**

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. **Mesh bag of onions**  
   Mesh is a woven material, onions are a bulk item. This seems to fit the theme. The material is woven, and onions are bulk. So maybe a 7-8? But wait, mesh is a bit different from the examples. The examples had specific materials like burlap or polypropylene. Mesh might be similar but not exactly the same. Maybe 7?

2. **Woven basket of fruit**  
   Woven basket, fruit is bulk. Woven matches the material, and fruit is a bulk item. This seems like a strong fit. Maybe 8-9. But the examples are more about sacks/bags, while baskets are open-top. Hmm. Maybe 7?

3. **Train car**  
   A train car is a vehicle, similar to dump truck (anti-example). So this is a vehicle for transport, not a container made of woven material. Definitely an anti-example. So 0 or 1? Since anti-examples are excluded, maybe 0.

4. **Ceramic pot of soil**  
   Ceramic is a rigid material, not woven. Soil is bulk but the container is ceramic. So this is like the metal bucket (anti-example). So 0 or 1.

5. **Steel drum of oil**  
   Steel drum is a rigid container, like the metal bucket. Definitely an anti-example. 0.

6. **Wooden crate of apples**  
   Wooden crate is a rigid container. The examples are flexible bags. But apples are bulk. However, the material is wood, not woven. So maybe 2? Since it's a container for bulk but not woven. Maybe 3?

7. **Cargo ship**  
   Like train car and dump truck, it's a vehicle. So 0.

8. **Cardboard box of cereal**  
   Cardboard is a different material. Boxes are rigid, but maybe not as rigid as metal. Cereal is bulk. But the container isn't woven. So maybe 2? Or 3? Since it's a box, not a sack. Maybe 3.

Wait, let me reassess each again carefully:

1. Mesh bag: yes, woven material (mesh is woven), holds onions (bulk). So maybe 8? The examples have specific materials (burlap, polypropylene, crochet). Mesh might be similar to polypropylene (synthetic), so 8.

2. Woven basket: the container is a basket, which is woven. Fruit is bulk. So this is very close. The examples are sacks/bags, but baskets are also containers made of woven materials. Maybe 9? Or 8. Since the examples are specifically "bags" (sandbag, shopping bag, sack), but basket is a different type of container. Maybe 7.

3. Train car: definitely a vehicle, so 0.

4. Ceramic pot: rigid, so 0.

5. Steel drum: 0.

6. Wooden crate: rigid, but apples are bulk. Maybe 2 because it's a container but not woven. The examples require woven materials. So 2.

7. Cargo ship: 0.

8. Cardboard box: rigid, so maybe 1. Since it's a box, not woven. 1 or 2. Maybe 2.

Wait, let me check again the anti-examples. The anti-examples are metal bucket (rigid container), silo (structure), dump truck (vehicle). So the key is that the container must be a flexible woven bag/sack, not rigid or a vehicle. 

So:

1. Mesh bag: woven, flexible. 8?

2. Woven basket: woven, but basket vs. sack. Maybe 7?

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. wooden crate is rigid, so 0? Wait, but the examples include "woven polypropylene sandbag" which is a woven bag. The anti-examples are metal bucket (rigid), so wooden crate is rigid. So wooden crate would be similar to the anti-example (metal bucket). So 0? But apples are bulk. Hmm, but the container's material is key. So maybe 1? Because it's a container for bulk but not woven. Maybe 2?

Wait, perhaps the score should be based on how closely they match the specific theme. The theme is woven/flexible bags for bulk. So:

- If the container is woven/flexible and holds bulk, then high score.

- If the container is not woven/flexible but holds bulk, lower score.

- If it's a vehicle or structure, 0.

So:

1. Mesh bag (woven, bulk): 8.

2. Woven basket (woven, bulk): 9? Because basket is a woven container, similar to the examples. Maybe 9.

Wait, the examples include "woven polypropylene sandbag" which is a sandbag (sack). A basket is also a woven container, so maybe equally valid. So 9?

3. Train car: 0.

4. Ceramic pot: 0.

5. Steel drum: 0.

6. Wooden crate: not woven, rigid. So 0? Or maybe 1? Because it's a container for bulk but not woven. Since anti-examples are metal bucket (rigid container), wooden crate is similar but apples are bulk. But since the theme requires woven material, maybe 0.

Wait, the anti-examples include metal bucket (rigid container). So wooden crate is another rigid container, so same as anti-examples, so 0.

7. Cargo ship: 0.

8. Cardboard box: rigid, so 0. But cereal is bulk. But cardboard isn't woven, so 0 or 1?

Hmm. Maybe the scores need to be more nuanced. Let's see:

The examples are all woven or crochet (which is a type of hand-woven). The anti-examples are rigid containers (metal, steel, ceramic) or vehicles/structures.

So for each candidate:

1. Mesh bag: woven (yes), flexible (yes), bulk item (yes). So 10? Wait, the examples have specific materials like burlap, polypropylene, crochet. Mesh is a different weave but still woven. So maybe 9 or 10. But maybe the examples include different materials, so mesh is acceptable. So 10? Wait, but the first example is "crocheted shopping bag", which is a different technique but still a bag. So maybe 10. Wait, but the user said to not output the theme, so perhaps the answer expects a lower score. Wait the user's examples are all bags, so maybe Mesh bag is a bag, so 10? But the user's anti-examples are metal bucket (a container but rigid). So maybe Mesh bag is a perfect fit. Wait, let's check the anti-examples again. The anti-examples are metal bucket (rigid), silo (structure), dump truck (vehicle). So the Mesh bag is a good fit. So maybe 9 or 10. Hmm. Let me think of the first example: "Crocheted shopping bag for bulk rice" — the material is crochet, which is a specific technique. Mesh is a different technique but still woven. So maybe 9.

2. Woven basket of fruit: same as above. Basket is woven, holds bulk (fruit). So maybe 9 or 10. Since basket is a different container than a sack, but still woven. Maybe 9.

3. Train car: 0.

4. Ceramic pot of soil: 0.

5. Steel drum of oil: 0.

6. Wooden crate of apples: wooden is rigid, so 0. But maybe 1? Because it's a container for bulk apples, but the container isn't woven. Since anti-examples are rigid containers, so same category as anti-examples, so 0.

7. Cargo ship: 0.

8. Cardboard box of cereal: cardboard is rigid, so 0. Maybe 1? But cereal is bulk. But container is not woven. So 0.

Wait, perhaps some of these have nuances. For example, the woven basket is a closer match than the mesh bag? Or vice versa. Alternatively, maybe the Mesh bag is a better fit because it's a bag. The basket is a basket, so maybe a bit less. Let me think again.

The examples include "Burlap sack of coffee beans" — a sack, which is a bag. The first example is a shopping bag. So the container is a bag. The woven basket is a basket, which is a different type of container. So maybe the basket is slightly less aligned because it's a basket instead of a bag. So maybe Mesh bag (bag) gets 9, basket gets 8? Or maybe the material is more important than the container type. Since the examples have different container types (shopping bag, sandbag, sack), all are bags. So a basket is a different type. So maybe basket is 7?

Alternatively, if the key is woven material, then woven basket is a strong fit (9), and mesh bag (also woven) is 9. But the first example is crocheted, which is a different technique but still a bag. So maybe they are both 9. Hmm.

Alternatively, the anti-examples are metal bucket (rigid container), so any rigid container (like wooden crate, ceramic pot) are 0. The Mesh bag and woven basket are both woven and flexible, so they should be high. The cardboard box is rigid, so 0. So maybe:

1. Mesh bag: 9

2. Woven basket: 9

But maybe the user expects some variation. Let me see the candidates again.

Wait, the third example is "Burlap sack of coffee beans" — burlap is a material. The first is crocheted (a technique), second is woven polypropylene (material and technique). So the theme is containers made of woven or similar materials (like crochet) for bulk items, specifically bags/sacks. So a basket is a woven container but not a sack/bag, so maybe 8. Mesh bag is a bag made of woven material, so 9 or 10.

Alternatively, the user might consider that "woven basket" is a close match (since it's woven and holds bulk), so 9, and the mesh bag is also 9. But since I need to assign different scores, maybe the mesh bag is 9, the basket is 8?

Alternatively, perhaps the mesh bag is a perfect fit (10), woven basket is also 10, but the user wants to have a range. Maybe the user's examples are all bags, so the basket is a basket, so slightly less. Hmm. This is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the container is a bag (as in the examples are all bags), so the basket is a different type, so it's a 7, while the mesh bag is a bag so 9.

I think I need to make a decision here. Let's proceed with:

1. Mesh bag of onions: 8 (since it's a woven bag for bulk, similar to examples)

2. Woven basket of fruit: 7 (woven, but basket instead of bag)

3. Train car: 0

4. Ceramic pot of soil: 0

5. Steel drum of oil: 0

6. Wooden crate of apples: 0 (rigid container like anti-examples)

7. Cargo ship: 0

8. Cardboard box of cereal: 0 (rigid container)

Wait, but for the wooden crate, maybe it's a container for bulk but rigid, so same as anti-examples, so 0. Cardboard box is also rigid, so 0.

Alternatively, maybe the woven basket is 9, mesh bag 9. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the mesh bag is a better fit because it's a bag, so 9. The basket is 8. Let's do that.

So final scores:

1. 8

2.7

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

Wait, but the user wants the full range, so maybe some of the lower ones can have 1 or 2?

Wait, for example, the wooden crate: apples are bulk, but the container is rigid. Since anti-examples are rigid containers, so it's similar, so 0. But maybe 1? Because it's a container for bulk but not woven. The user might consider that it's not exactly matching but close? Hmm. Maybe 1 for wooden crate?

Wait, the anti-examples are metal bucket, silo, dump truck. The wooden crate is another rigid container, so same category, so 0. The cardboard box is rigid, so 0. The woven basket is a woven container, so 7-9.

Alternatively, maybe the cardboard box is a different material but still a container for bulk. But since it's not woven, so 0. But maybe 1 because it's a container for bulk but not the right material? Maybe that's stretching.

Alternatively, maybe the Mesh bag and woven basket get higher scores, and others are lower. Let's see:

1. Mesh bag: 9

2. Woven basket:8

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user might want some variation in the scores. Alternatively, the woven basket is as good as the examples, so 9 or 10. The mesh bag is 10? Let's see:

Examples have different materials (crochet, woven polypropylene, burlap). So mesh is another woven material, so maybe 10. Woven basket is also woven, so 9. Or both 10?

Hmm. The user's examples include "woven polypropylene sandbag" which is a sandbag (a type of bag). The basket is a different container type, but still woven. So maybe 9 for the basket. The mesh bag is a bag, so 10. But maybe the user wants to avoid 10. Alternatively, the first example is crocheted, which is hand-made, while woven basket might be hand-woven as well. So maybe both are 9.

Alternatively, maybe the user considers that the examples are all sacks/bags, so the basket is less of a fit. So 8.

I think I'll go with:

1. Mesh bag: 9

2. Woven basket: 8

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7.0

8.0

But then the scores are 9,8,0s. But the user wants the full range. Let me check again the candidates:

Looking at candidate 8: Cardboard box of cereal. Cardboard is rigid, not woven, so 0. 

Candidate 6: Wooden crate is rigid, so 0. 

Candidate 4: ceramic pot is rigid, so 0. 

Candidate 5: steel drum is rigid, 0.

Candidate 3: train car is vehicle, 0. 

Candidate 7: cargo ship is vehicle, 0.

So the only non-zero are 1 and 2.

But the user wants the scores to use the full range 0-10. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the "woven basket" is a better fit than the mesh bag? Because the examples include "woven polypropylene sandbag" which is woven, and the basket is also woven. The mesh bag is woven but maybe the material (mesh) is different. Alternatively, mesh could be considered a type of woven material, so it's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the "cardboard box" is a container for bulk (cereal) but not woven. Since it's a box, maybe 1?

Wait, the anti-examples are metal bucket (rigid container), so cardboard box is also a rigid container, so same category, so 0. 

Hmm. I think the only two candidates that match are 1 and 2. The rest are 0. But the user wants to use the full range. Maybe I made a mistake in the theme.

Wait, let's re-examine the theme. The examples are all bags made of specific woven or crochet materials for bulk items. The anti-examples are rigid containers (metal, steel, ceramic) or vehicles/structures. So the key is:

- Must be a bag/sack/container made of flexible, woven or similar material.

- Holds bulk items.

- Not rigid containers, vehicles, or structures.

So the candidates:

1. Mesh bag of onions: yes, woven (mesh is woven), flexible bag, bulk onions. So 10?

Wait why not? The examples are all 10. So maybe mesh bag is a perfect fit (10), woven basket is also a woven container but basket vs. bag, so maybe 9.

2. Woven basket of fruit: woven, holds bulk fruit, but basket is a different container type. So 9.

Others are 0.

Alternatively, maybe the "wooden crate of apples" is a container for bulk, but not woven. Since the theme is woven, so 0. 

So maybe:

1. 10

2.9

others 0.

But the user said to use the full range. Hmm. Perhaps the user expects some middle scores for some candidates. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe "cardboard box of cereal" is a container for bulk but not woven. Since it's a box (rigid), but cereal is in a box. But the anti-examples include rigid containers (metal bucket), so this is similar. So 0.

"Wooden crate of apples": same as metal bucket, so 0.

"Ceramic pot of soil": 0.

"Steel drum of oil":0.

"Train car" and "Cargo ship" are vehicles:0.

"Woven basket": 9.

"Mesh bag":10.

Alternatively, maybe the "woven basket" is 8 because it's a basket instead of a bag.

Alternatively, perhaps the "wooden crate" is a container for bulk but not woven, so maybe 1? Since it's a container for bulk but not the right material. But the anti-examples are rigid containers, so same category. So maybe 0.

Hmm. I think I need to proceed with the scores as:

1.10

2.9

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But that only uses 0,9,10. Not the full range. Alternatively, maybe some candidates are partial matches.

Wait, "cardboard box of cereal" is a container for bulk but not woven. Since the theme requires woven material, maybe 1?

Or "wooden crate" could be 1? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the "woven basket" is a 9, and "mesh bag" is 10. The rest are 0 except maybe "wooden crate" is 1.

Alternatively, maybe "cardboard box" is 1?

Alternatively, perhaps the "woven basket" is a 9, and "mesh bag" 10, and "wooden crate" is 1 (since it's a container for bulk but not woven, so minimal match). 

But I'm not sure. Since the user says to use the full range, maybe I need to assign some middle numbers.

Wait, maybe "woven basket" is 9, "mesh bag" 10.

"Wooden crate" is 1 (since it's a container for bulk but not woven, but rigid like anti-examples).

"Ceramic pot" 0.

"Cardboard box" 1?

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe "wooden crate" is 2?

Alternatively, the "woven basket" is 8, and "mesh bag" 9.

Then the rest are 0 or 1.

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I'll proceed with:

1. Mesh bag of onions: 9 (woven bag, bulk)

2. Woven basket of fruit:8 (woven, but basket)

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

This uses 8,9,0. Not the full range but better.

Alternatively, perhaps the "cardboard box of cereal" could be a 1, since it's a container for bulk but not woven. 

"Wooden crate of apples" 1.

"Ceramic pot of soil" 0.

"Steel drum of oil"0.

So:

6. Wooden crate:1

8. Cardboard box:1

Then the scores would be:

1.9

2.8

6.1

8.1

Others 0.

This uses 0,1,8,9. Still not full range. 

Alternatively, maybe "woven basket" is 9, "mesh bag" 10, "wooden crate" 2, "cardboard box"1, "ceramic pot"0, "steel drum"0, "train car"0, "cargo ship"0.

So:

1.10

2.9

6.2

8.1

Others 0.

That gives 0,1,2,9,10.

Still not full range, but better.

Alternatively, maybe "woven basket" is 7, "mesh bag"8, and "wooden crate"2, "cardboard box"1. 

But I'm not confident. Since I have to choose, I'll go with the initial thought where the only non-zero are 1 and 2, with 9 and 8 respectively, and the rest 0. Even if it's not the full range, maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, the user might expect some scores like 7 for mesh bag, 6 for basket, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The examples include "Burlap sack of coffee beans". The "woven basket" is a basket, which is a different container but still woven. So maybe 7.

The mesh bag is a bag made of mesh (woven), so 8.

The wooden crate is rigid, so 0.

The cardboard box is rigid, 0.

The ceramic pot and steel drum are rigid, 0.

So:

1.8

2.7

others 0.

That's 0,7,8.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the "cardboard box" is a container for bulk but not woven. Since it's a box, maybe 2?

The "wooden crate" is 1.

So:

6.1

8.2

Then scores would be 1,2,7,8,0.

Better.

I think I'll proceed with the following:

1. Mesh bag of onions: 8 (woven, bag, bulk)

2. Woven basket of fruit:7 (woven, but basket)

3.0

4.0

5.0

6. Wooden crate of apples:1 (container for bulk but rigid)

7.0

8. Cardboard box of cereal:2 (container for bulk but rigid and non-woven)

Wait, but rigid containers are anti-examples, so maybe 1 and 2 are too lenient. The user said anti-examples are rigid containers (metal bucket, etc.), so wooden crate and cardboard box are similar, so they should be 0. 

Hmm. I think I'll stick to:

1.8

2.7

others 0.

Thus the final scores would be:

<number>1</number><score>8</score>

<number>2</number><score>7</score>

<number>3</number><score>0</score>

<number>4</number><score>0</score>

<number>5</number><score>0</score>

<number>6</number><score>0</score>

<number>7</number><score>0</score>

<number>8</number><score>0</score>
</think>

<number>1</number><score>8</score>
<number>2</number><score>7</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>0</score>
<number>6</number><score>0</score>
<number>7</number><score>0</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
