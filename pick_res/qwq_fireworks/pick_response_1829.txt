Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user gave three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to determine the specific theme they're pointing to. The examples are Emerald Bay State Park, Silver Falls State Park, and Golden Gate Park. The anti-examples are all national parks: Great Smoky Mountains, Grand Canyon, Everglades.

Hmm, so the examples are all parks but not national parks. Emerald Bay is a state park, Silver Falls is a state park too, and Golden Gate Park is a city park in San Francisco. The anti-examples are all national parks. So maybe the theme is "state or local parks" versus "national parks"? But let me check again.

Wait, Golden Gate isn't a state park either—it's a municipal park. So perhaps the theme is parks that are not part of the National Park Service. The examples are all state or local parks, while the anti-examples are all National Parks. So the task is to evaluate the candidates based on whether they are state/local parks rather than national parks.

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Death Valley National Park – that's a national park. So it's an anti-example. So score 0?
2. Yosemite National Park – also a national park. 0?
3. Badlands National Park – same, national park. 0?
4. Sequoia National Park – national park again. 0?
5. Blue Ridge Parkway – this is a National Parkway managed by the NPS. So also a national-level park. So 0?
6. Shenandoah National Park – another national park. 0?
7. Glacier National Park – national park. 0?
8. Rocky Mountain National Park – national park. 0?

Wait a second, but maybe there's another angle. Maybe the theme isn't just about state vs national. Let me think again. The examples include Emerald Bay (state), Silver Falls (state), and Golden Gate (city). The anti-examples are all National Parks. So the theme is "non-national parks" (state or local). Therefore, all the candidates here are national parks except maybe some? Wait, let me confirm each candidate:

Looking up each candidate:

1. Death Valley National Park – yes, part of NPS.
2. Yosemite – NPS.
3. Badlands – NPS.
4. Sequoia – NPS.
5. Blue Ridge Parkway – administered by NPS as a parkway.
6. Shenandoah – NPS.
7. Glacier – NPS.
8. Rocky Mountain – NPS.

All of them are national parks. Then according to the theme, they should all be 0. But the user wants scores from 0 to 10, and to use the full range. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. The user said the anti-examples are part of a broader theme. Maybe the specific theme is something else?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks named after colors or minerals? Emerald (green), Silver, Golden (gold). The anti-examples are named after places or features (Great Smoky Mountains, Grand Canyon, Everglades). The candidates:

1. Death Valley – no color/mineral.
2. Yosemite – no.
3. Badlands – no.
4. Sequoia (tree name) – no.
5. Blue Ridge – "Blue" is a color, but the full name is Blue Ridge Parkway. Maybe "Blue" counts? But the anti-examples include Great Smoky Mountains which isn't a color. Hmm, maybe not.
6. Shenandoah – no.
7. Glacier – no.
8. Rocky Mountain – no.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that are smaller or more localized, not the big national parks. But the examples include Golden Gate which is a major park. Alternatively, maybe the theme is urban or city parks? Golden Gate is a city park, but the others (Emerald Bay and Silver Falls) are state parks. Not sure.

Wait another angle: The examples include "State Park" in their names (Emerald Bay State Park, Silver Falls State Park), while Golden Gate Park is just "Park" but is a city park. The anti-examples are all "National Park". So maybe the theme is parks that have "State Park" or similar in their names, or are not National Parks. But the candidates are all National Parks except maybe Blue Ridge Parkway (which is a parkway, but still NPS). So all the candidates would be 0. But the user wants a range from 0-10, so maybe there's a different theme.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that have a specific natural feature in their names? Emerald Bay (bay), Silver Falls (falls), Golden Gate (gate, though that's a strait). The anti-examples are larger geographical features (mountains, canyon, wetlands). The candidates: Death Valley (valley), Yosemite (name of a place), Badlands (geological feature), Sequoia (tree, but also a national park), Blue Ridge (mountain range), Shenandoah (river?), Glacier (glaciers), Rocky Mountain (mountains). Hmm, maybe the examples have more specific or smaller-scale features (falls, bay, gate) vs the anti-examples which are larger (mountains, canyon, wetlands). So the candidates: Death Valley (a valley, maybe small?), but Death Valley is a big national park. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks named after precious materials or colors (Emerald, Silver, Golden). So the candidates would need to have color or mineral in their names. Let's see:

Looking at the candidates:

1. Death Valley – no.
2. Yosemite – no.
3. Badlands – no.
4. Sequoia – Sequoia is a tree type, not a color.
5. Blue Ridge – "Blue" is a color. Maybe that's a 10? But Blue Ridge Parkway is a parkway, not a state park. The anti-examples include Great Smoky Mountains which has "Smoky" (a color?), but that's an anti-example. Hmm, conflicting.
6. Shenandoah – no.
7. Glacier – Glacier is a natural feature, not a color/mineral.
8. Rocky Mountain – "Rocky" but not a color.

Wait, maybe the theme is parks with "Bay", "Falls", or "Gate" in their names? Emerald Bay, Silver Falls, Golden Gate. The anti-examples don't have those. So candidates with similar terms would score higher. Let's check:

1. Death Valley – "Valley" but not the key terms. Maybe 1?
2. Yosemite – no.
3. Badlands – no.
4. Sequoia – no.
5. Blue Ridge – "Blue" but not exactly.
6. Shenandoah – no.
7. Glacier – no.
8. Rocky Mountain – no.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that are not part of the major national parks (like the anti-examples are very famous ones). The examples are state parks which are maybe less well-known. The candidates are all national parks, but some might be less famous. But Death Valley, Yosemite, etc., are all major. So maybe all 0. But the user wants a range. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the theme is parks that are in California? Emerald Bay is in CA, Silver Falls is Oregon, Golden Gate is CA. The anti-examples are in different states. The candidates: Death Valley (CA?), Yosemite (CA), Badlands (SD), Sequoia (CA), Blue Ridge (NC/VA), Shenandoah (VA), Glacier (MT), Rocky Mountain (CO). So CA ones would be 1,2,4. But the examples include Oregon (Silver Falls). So maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that are not national parks but are state parks. Since all candidates are national parks except none, then they all get 0. But the user wants a 0-10 score. Maybe some are more national park-like than others? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is parks that are smaller in size. Emerald Bay is a small state park, Silver Falls is a state park, Golden Gate is a city park. The anti-examples are huge national parks. The candidates: Death Valley is huge, so 0. But maybe some candidates are smaller? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that are not part of the "National Park" designation but are other types like State Parks or Municipal Parks. Since all candidates are National Parks or Parkways, they are all 0. But the user wants scores spread out. Maybe some have different statuses? Blue Ridge Parkway is a parkway, not a national park, but it's managed by NPS. So maybe Blue Ridge gets a 1? But the anti-examples include national parks, so parkways might be considered a step down. But the user's examples don't include parkways. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is parks that have a specific type of feature. Emerald Bay has a lake, Silver Falls has waterfalls, Golden Gate has the famous bridge and gardens. The anti-examples are more about large natural landscapes. The candidates: Death Valley has dunes, Yosemite has waterfalls and cliffs, Badlands have rock formations, Sequoia has big trees, Blue Ridge has mountains, Shenandoah has forests, Glacier has glaciers, Rocky Mountain has peaks. Maybe some have features similar to the examples. For instance, Yosemite has waterfalls like Silver Falls, so maybe Yosemite gets a higher score. Let's see:

Silver Falls (waterfalls) – Yosemite has waterfalls too. Maybe Yosemite would score higher than others. Emerald Bay is a bay with a lake; maybe Glacier has lakes? Not sure. Golden Gate has a gate (strait) and gardens. Death Valley has a valley. Maybe the theme is parks with a specific natural feature named in their title. So Emerald (bay), Silver (falls), Golden (gate). The candidates with similar features:

1. Death Valley – valley? Maybe a 2?
2. Yosemite – falls (Yosemite Falls), so maybe 7?
3. Badlands – no feature in name, but "Badlands" is a type of terrain. Maybe 3?
4. Sequoia – named after trees, so maybe 5?
5. Blue Ridge – ridge, maybe 4?
6. Shenandoah – river? Not sure, maybe 1?
7. Glacier – named after glaciers, so 8?
8. Rocky Mountain – mountain, so 6?

But this is speculative. Alternatively, if the theme is parks named after a color or precious material (Emerald, Silver, Golden), then the candidates with color names would score higher. Blue Ridge has "Blue", Glacier has "Glacier" (not a color), Rocky Mountain has "Rocky". So Blue Ridge might get a 7, but since "Blue" is a color, but the anti-example includes "Great Smoky" which has a color but is an anti-example. Hmm, conflicting.

Alternatively, the theme could be parks that are not among the "big three" national parks (like the anti-examples are very famous ones). But Death Valley and others are also famous. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all in the western US, but the anti-examples are also in the west. Not helpful.

Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider the initial assumption. The user says the anti-examples are part of a broader theme. The examples are state parks, so the specific theme is "state parks", while the anti-examples are "national parks". Therefore, the candidates are all national parks except maybe some. Since all the candidates listed are national parks, they would all get 0. But the user wants a range. Wait, the Blue Ridge Parkway is a National Parkway, which is a different designation but still under NPS. Maybe it's a 1? Or maybe some have "State" in their names? None of the candidates do. So maybe all 0s, but the user wants a range. Perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait the examples include Golden Gate Park, which is a city park. So maybe the theme is "non-national parks", which includes state, city, or local parks. Since all candidates are national parks except maybe none, all get 0. But the user wants a range. Maybe the task is to rate how much they resemble the examples in another way. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the theme is parks that have a name starting with a color or precious metal: Emerald (green), Silver, Golden (gold). The anti-examples don't have that. So candidates with color names would get higher scores. Let's check:

1. Death Valley – no (gray? but not in name)
2. Yosemite – no
3. Badlands – no
4. Sequoia – no (tree)
5. Blue Ridge – Blue is a color. Maybe 7?
6. Shenandoah – no
7. Glacier – Glacier is a feature, not a color
8. Rocky Mountain – Rocky is an adjective but not a color

So Blue Ridge Parkway would be 7, others lower. But the anti-example includes Great Smoky Mountains (Smoky is a color, but it's an anti-example). So that contradicts. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that have a "Bay", "Falls", or "Gate" in their names. Emerald Bay, Silver Falls, Golden Gate. So candidates with similar terms:

1. Death Valley – no
2. Yosemite – no
3. Badlands – no
4. Sequoia – no
5. Blue Ridge – no
6. Shenandoah – no
7. Glacier – no
8. Rocky Mountain – no

Only Blue Ridge has "Blue" but not the exact terms. Maybe 1?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that are smaller in size. The examples are state parks which are smaller than the big national parks. So the candidates are all national parks, so they are bigger. But maybe some are smaller than others. For example, Rocky Mountain is 415 sq km, which is smaller than Yosemite (3000+). Maybe size differences? But I don't have exact sizes. This is getting too vague.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that are not designated as "National Parks" but are other types like National Monuments, State Parks, etc. Since all candidates are National Parks, they are 0. But perhaps some are National Forests or something else? No, they are all NPS.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the initial thought that the theme is state/local parks vs national parks. So all the candidates are national parks, so 0. But the user wants scores from 0-10. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow. Alternatively, perhaps the theme is parks that are not part of the "National Park" system but are other types. Since all are NPS, they are 0. But the user said to use the full range. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples.

Wait another angle: The examples are all parks with "Park" in their name, but the anti-examples are "National Park". Wait, no. The examples include Emerald Bay State Park (has "State Park"), Silver Falls State Park, and Golden Gate Park (just "Park"). The anti-examples are all "National Park". So maybe the theme is parks that are not designated as National Parks, regardless of being state or local. So any park not a national park is good. The candidates are all National Parks except maybe Blue Ridge Parkway (which is a National Parkway, but still part of NPS). So all get 0. But then the user wants a range. Maybe some are less "national" in their designation? Like Blue Ridge Parkway is a parkway, so maybe 1? Or maybe the user wants to consider that some are less well-known national parks, so they score lower? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is parks that are not part of the 63 national parks (there are 63 official NP designations). For example, the anti-examples are among the most famous, so maybe the candidates vary in how famous they are. But Death Valley and Yosemite are also famous. Maybe the less famous ones get higher scores? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all in California except Silver Falls (Oregon). The anti-examples are in different states. The candidates: Death Valley (CA), Yosemite (CA), others elsewhere. So CA ones might score higher? But Golden Gate is CA, so maybe CA parks get higher scores. Then Death Valley and Yosemite would be 8, Sequoia (CA) would be 8, but Sequoia is a candidate. Wait, Sequoia is #4. Let me see:

1. Death Valley (CA) – 8
2. Yosemite (CA) – 8
4. Sequoia (CA) – 8
Others would be lower. But the examples include Oregon (Silver Falls), so maybe Oregon's would be better but none are in the list. Not sure.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should go with the initial thought that the theme is non-national parks, so all candidates are 0, but the user wants a range. Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks with "Bay", "Falls", or "Gate" in their names. Then only Blue Ridge has "Blue" (a color) but not the exact terms. Maybe give Blue Ridge a 3, others 0. But not sure.

Alternatively, the examples have "Emerald" (green), "Silver", "Golden" (gold). So the theme could be parks named after colors or metals. Candidates with color names: Blue Ridge (Blue), maybe 7. Glacier has "Glacier" (not a color). Rocky Mountain has "Rocky" (adjective). So only Blue Ridge gets a 7, others 0 or low.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is parks that are not part of the "Seven Natural Wonders" or similar. But not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll go with the color/metal theme. The examples have names with colors/metals. The candidates with color names (Blue Ridge) get a 7, others 0 or low. But since the user wants a range, maybe:

Blue Ridge (Blue) – 7
Others have no color in name except maybe Rocky (adjective) – 2?
Glacier (natural feature) – 1?
Death Valley (valley) – 0
Yosemite (name) – 0
Badlands (feature) – 0
Sequoia (tree) – 0
Rocky Mountain (mountain) – maybe 1?
Shenandoah – 0

But this is a guess. Alternatively, if it's about being state parks, then all are 0. But the user wants a range. Maybe I'll go with the color approach.
