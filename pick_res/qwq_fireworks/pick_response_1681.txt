Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples and anti-examples. The examples are Faceted crystal chandeliers, Dichroic glass installations, and Iridescent tiled facades. The anti-examples are Rainbows, Soap bubbles, and Oil slicks on water.

Hmm, so the examples all seem to involve man-made structures or objects that create colorful, reflective, or prismatic effects through their materials. Faceted crystals, dichroic glass (which changes color with angle), and iridescent tiles—all are architectural or decorative elements using specific materials to produce visual effects. 

The anti-examples are natural phenomena or everyday occurrences that also produce colorful effects but aren't man-made or part of constructed installations. Rainbows, soap bubbles, oil slicks are all caused by light refraction or interference but are temporary and not part of designed structures. So the key difference seems to be that the theme is about structured, designed objects using specific materials to create these effects, rather than natural occurrences.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. CD reflections: CDs have a reflective surface with grooves that cause diffraction, creating rainbow patterns. But CDs themselves are mass-produced items, not specifically designed as decorative installations. They might be considered more like everyday objects, so maybe closer to anti-examples? But they are man-made. Hmm.

2. Sunsets: Definitely a natural phenomenon, so that's an anti-example territory. But maybe if someone considers sunset colors in a structure? Probably not. So likely a 0 or low score.

3. Light diffraction gratings: These are scientific tools, but they are man-made. They produce similar effects to CDs but are more technical. They are structured but perhaps not for decorative purposes. So maybe mid-range?

4. Prismatic skylights: That sounds like a designed architectural element, using prisms to refract light, similar to the examples. This should be a high score.

5. Northern Lights: Another natural phenomenon, so definitely an anti-example. Score 0.

6. Butterfly wings: Their color comes from structural coloration, not pigments. While it's a natural occurrence, but the mechanism is similar to some man-made materials like dichroic glass. However, since it's natural, it's an anti-example. But wait, the examples include materials like dichroic glass which mimic such effects. Maybe there's ambiguity here? The theme is about man-made structures, so butterfly wings would be natural, so low score.

7. Peacock feathers: Similar to butterfly wings. They use structural color but are natural. So anti-example, low score.

8. Opal: Opals have a milky, iridescent play of color due to their structure. Opals are gemstones, so natural, but they can be used in jewelry or decorative items. Wait, but the theme examples are about installations or facades, which are larger structures. Opals are individual stones. So maybe a middle score if considered a material used in such structures, but since it's a natural material, maybe lower? Or if the opal is part of a designed piece, but the candidate just says "Opal"—the mineral itself is natural. So perhaps a 3?

Wait, let me re-express the theme again. The examples are all large-scale decorative or architectural elements using specific materials (crystals, dichroic glass, tiles) that produce iridescence or prismatic effects. The anti-examples are natural phenomena. So the theme is "man-made decorative structures or installations that use specific materials to create iridescent, prismatic, or multi-colored visual effects through their design and material properties."

So for each candidate:

1. CD reflections: Man-made, creates rainbow effects via diffraction. But CDs are not decorative installations. They’re functional items. So maybe a 3? Because they have the effect but not the intended use as decoration.

2. Sunsets: Natural, 0.

3. Light diffraction gratings: Scientific tool, not decorative, so maybe 2 or 3.

4. Prismatic skylights: Definitely fits, maybe 8 or 9? Since skylights are architectural, using prisms for light effects.

5. Northern Lights: Natural, 0.

6. Butterfly wings: Natural, 0 or 1.

7. Peacock feathers: Same, 0 or1.

8. Opal: Natural stone, but if used in jewelry or art, but the candidate just says "Opal"—the material itself is natural. So maybe 2? Unless considering that opals can be part of decorative items, but the example is about the material. Since the examples are about installations, maybe it's a 3? Hmm.

Wait, maybe CD reflections are more similar to anti-examples (like soap bubbles) because they create rainbow effects but are not part of a decorative structure. So maybe CD reflections get a 2?

Prismatic skylights would be a 9 or 10. Wait, the examples are 10. The examples are the best matches, so maybe 10? But the user said not to use just 0 and 10, but the examples are the top. Since the user wants the specific theme, maybe prismatic skylights are a 10?

Wait, the user said the examples are the top, so if a candidate is as good as the examples, it's 10. The anti-examples are 0. The rest are in between.

Let me re-express each candidate:

1. CD reflections: The reflection creates rainbow colors. But CDs are not decorative installations. They are everyday objects. So similar to soap bubbles (anti-example) but man-made. Maybe a 3?

2. Sunsets: 0.

3. Diffraction gratings: scientific tool, man-made, structured but not decorative. Maybe 2.

4. Prismatic skylights: Yes, architectural element designed to refract light, like chandeliers or dichroic installations. This should be a 10? But maybe not exactly like the examples. Wait, the examples are all about materials (crystal, dichroic glass, tiles) creating the effect through their structure. Prismatic skylights use prisms, which are similar to faceted crystals. So maybe 9 or 10. Since the examples are 10, perhaps 10?

Wait, but maybe the examples are all installations or large structures. A skylight is part of a building, so yes. So 10.

Wait, but the user wants to avoid just 0 and 10. Maybe 9?

Hmm, maybe 9 is safer to allow some range.

5. Northern Lights: 0.

6. Butterfly wings: 0.

7. Peacock feathers: 0.

8. Opal: Natural, but the effect comes from internal structure. Since the examples use materials with such structures (dichroic glass, tiles), maybe opal as a material could be considered, but it's natural. The anti-examples are natural. So maybe 1 or 2.

Wait, but opal's color is due to its structure, similar to dichroic glass's structural properties. But since it's a natural mineral, not a man-made material used in installations, so probably a 2? Or maybe 3? Hmm.

Alternatively, if the candidate was "Opal jewelry" it would be higher, but just "Opal" as the material might be a 3? Not sure. Let me think again.

The theme is man-made structures using materials with those properties. So if opal is used in a facade or installation, but the candidate is just "Opal"—the material. Since the examples are about the installations, not the materials themselves, then maybe it's lower. So maybe 2.

So compiling:

1. CD reflections: 3 (man-made, but not decorative installations)
2. Sunsets: 0
3. Diffraction gratings: 2 (scientific tool, structured but not decorative)
4. Prismatic skylights: 9 (exactly fits the theme)
5. Northern Lights: 0
6. Butterfly wings: 0
7. Peacock feathers: 0
8. Opal: 2 (natural, but structural like examples' materials, but not part of an installation)

Wait, but maybe Opal is a material that could be part of an installation. Since the examples include materials like tiles and glass, maybe using opal in a facade would be a 7? But the candidate is just "Opal" the material. Hmm. The examples are about the installations, so the material alone isn't enough. So maybe 1?

Alternatively, if the theme is about the material's property (iridescence through structure), then opal's property matches, but it's natural. The anti-examples are natural. So 0? Wait, but the anti-examples are phenomena (rainbow, soap bubbles), not materials. Hmm, tricky.

The anti-examples are natural occurrences, so the theme excludes natural phenomena but includes man-made materials. So opal as a material is natural but has the structural property. However, the examples are about the installations made from such materials. Since the candidate is "Opal" itself, not an installation using it, maybe it's lower. Maybe 2? Or 1?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is about the visual effect (iridescence, prismatic) regardless of the structure, but the examples are man-made. So the theme is "man-made decorative structures that produce iridescent or prismatic effects through their materials and design." 

Thus, Opal as a material is natural, so not part of the theme, so 0? But then the anti-examples are phenomena, not materials. So maybe Opal can be a 3? Not sure.

Alternatively, since dichroic glass is a man-made material, and opal is a natural material with similar effect, but the theme requires it to be man-made. So Opal would be a 0? Hmm, but the anti-examples are phenomena, not materials. Maybe the anti-examples are about natural occurrences that produce the effect, so natural materials are allowed if used in installations? Wait, but the examples are all man-made materials. So perhaps natural materials are excluded. Therefore, opal would be 0? But that's conflicting. 

Alternatively, the key is whether it's a decorative structure. Opal in a ring is jewelry, which is decorative, but the candidate is just "Opal"—the material. So maybe 2?

I think I'll go with 2 for Opal. 

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 0

3. 2

4. 9
