Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided examples and anti-examples to define a specific theme. The examples are all wooden objects with dual purposes: practical use related to food and a ritual/ceremonial use. The anti-examples are wooden items that have a more general spiritual or symbolic role but aren't directly tied to both food use and a specific ritual beyond that.

First, I need to make sure I understand the specific theme. The examples are:

1. Wooden spoon for stirring sauces and in rituals to bless food.
2. Carved wooden bowl for serving food and as an offering vessel.
3. Wooden pestle for grinding spices and symbolizing fertility/prosperity.

So the key elements here are: 
- Made of wood.
- Have a practical function related to food preparation or serving.
- Also have a ceremonial or symbolic role, specifically tied to rituals involving food or similar cultural practices.

The anti-examples are things like an altar, cross, totem pole. These are wooden but their primary uses are more about general spiritual purposes (worship, symbolism) not directly tied to food handling. The theme isn't just "ritual objects" but specifically those that bridge food use and a specific ritual.

Now, looking at each candidate:

1. Wooden staff: Staffs can have symbolic roles (like a walking stick for a leader, or a spiritual guide), but do they have a food-related practical use? Not really. Unless in some cultures it's used in a specific food-related ritual, but generally, it's more about support or authority. So probably low score. Maybe 2 or 3.

2. Wooden coffin: Definitely related to death rituals, but not food. The practical use isn't food-related. So 0 or 1.

3. Wooden instrument: Could be a musical instrument. If it's used in ceremonies but not related to food prep/serving, then it's out. Unless it's something like a mortar (but mortar is already an example). Maybe a drum? Then it's a ritual but no food use. So low score, maybe 1-3.

4. Ceramic bowl: Not wooden, so immediately disqualified. The theme is specifically wooden items. So 0.

5. Wooden mask: Masks are ceremonial, but their practical use isn't related to food. Unless in a ritual where it's part of a feast, but generally masks are for wearing, not handling food. So maybe 2.

6. Wooden sculpture: Sculptures are art or symbolic, but again, not tied to food use. Unless it's a statue used in a food-related ritual, but that's a stretch. So low, maybe 1-2.

7. Wooden platter used for presenting food and ceremonial in indigenous traditions. This matches exactly the examples: food presentation (practical) and ceremonial use. So 10? Wait, but check the anti-examples. The anti-examples include things like totem poles which are ceremonial but not food-related. Since this platter has both, it's a perfect match. So 10?

Wait, the user's examples all have the dual use. The 7th candidate fits that exactly. So 10.

8. Wooden box: A box might store things, but unless it's specifically for food storage and has a ritual purpose, but generally boxes are too generic. Unless in some cultures, a box is used for offerings (like in ceremonies with food), but the description here just says "wooden box" without specifying. The examples have specific dual roles. So maybe 3? Since it's possible but not clearly stated. But the candidate's description is "used for presenting food at feasts and also as a ceremonial object..." Wait, no, candidate 7 is that. Candidate 8 is just a wooden box. So box's practical use might be storage, but no direct food handling. Unless in ceremonies it holds offerings, but that's similar to the bowl example. Hmm. The bowl was a vessel for offerings. A box could be similar. But the question is whether the practical use is food-related. A box's primary use isn't for serving or preparing food, unless specified. Since it's not, then maybe 3? Or lower.

Wait, the anti-examples include a wooden altar, which is a structure for rituals but not food handling. A box might be used to hold offerings (so practical use as a container, but not for preparing/serving food). The examples' practical uses are directly involved in food (stirring, serving, grinding). So a box's role might be more about storage or containment in a ritual, but not the actual handling of food in a culinary sense. So maybe a 4? Or 3.

Now let's go through each again with these thoughts.

1. Wooden staff: 2 (since maybe in some cultures used in rituals with food, but not primary)
2. Wooden coffin: 0 (no food link)
3. Wooden instrument: 1 (if it's a drum used in ceremony but no food use)
4. Ceramic bowl: 0 (not wood)
5. Wooden mask: 1 (ceremonial but no food use)
6. Wooden sculpture: 1 (same as above)
7. Wooden platter: 10 (exact match)
8. Wooden box: 3 (if used for offerings but not food handling, maybe 3 or 4)

Wait, but the anti-examples include a wooden altar. An altar is a structure for rituals but not food handling. The box is similar but maybe less directly connected. The examples all have the dual function where the object is directly involved in food handling (stirring, serving, grinding) plus a ritual. The box's practical use (storage) might not be considered "food-related" in the same way. Unless the box is used to present food in a ceremonial way, but that's like the platter. So maybe the box is too generic. So 3.

So final scores:

1. 2
2. 0
3. 1
4. 0
5. 1
6. 1
7. 10
8. 3
