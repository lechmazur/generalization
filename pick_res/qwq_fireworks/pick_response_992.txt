Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are Venus's polar vortex, Neptune's Great Dark Spot, and Jupiter's Great Red Spot. 

Hmm, all of these are large, persistent storm systems on gas giants or planets. The polar vortex on Venus is a atmospheric phenomenon at the pole, while the Great Dark Spot and Great Red Spot are massive storms on Neptune and Jupiter respectively. They are all long-lived, located on planets, and are part of the planet's climate system. 

Now the anti-examples are hurricane, typhoon, and cyclone. These are also storms but on Earth, and they form over oceans. The key difference here is that the examples are planetary-scale, long-lasting features, whereas hurricanes etc. are shorter-lived and Earth-specific. So the specific theme might be "long-lived, large-scale atmospheric vortexes or storms on gas giant planets or other planets, distinct from Earth's transient weather systems."

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this theme.

1. Hadley cell: These are Earth's atmospheric circulation cells. They're large-scale but not a storm or vortex. They're more about air movement patterns. So probably a low score, maybe 1 or 2? Since they're Earth-based and not a storm feature.

2. Fire whirl: These are small, short-lived whirls from fires. Definitely Earth-based and temporary. So 0 or 1.

3. Waterspout: A tornado over water. Again Earth, short-lived. Anti-example category. 0.

4. Dust devil: Similar to tornadoes, Earth-based, short-lived. 0 or 1.

5. Saturn's North Polar Hexagon: That's a hexagonal cloud pattern around Saturn's north pole. It's a long-lived, planetary feature. Definitely matches the theme. Probably a 10?

Wait, but the examples include polar vortex and the Great Spots. The hexagon is a similar planetary feature. So yes, 10.

6. Tornado: Earth-based, short-lived. Anti-example. 0.

7. Snow devil: Like a dust devil but in snow. Earth, short. 0 or 1.

8. Steam devil: Another Earth-based small vortex, maybe over hot surfaces. 0 or 1.

Wait, but let me check each again carefully. The theme is planetary-scale, persistent, not Earth's transient weather. 

Hadley cells are part of Earth's climate system, so they're large-scale but not a storm or vortex. Maybe a 2? Since they are structured but not storms. 

Fire whirls are more like a fire-induced vortex but temporary. 1.

Waterspout and tornado are definitely 0. 

Dust devil, snow devil, steam devil: all 0 or 1. Maybe 1 for dust devil since it's a vortex, but still Earth and short.

Saturn's Hexagon is a 10. 

Wait, the examples include polar vortex (which is a large-scale wind pattern, not a storm exactly). The hexagon is a stable atmospheric feature, so yes, maybe 10. 

So scoring:

1. Hadley cell: 2
2. Fire whirl: 1
3. Waterspout: 0
4. Dust devil: 1
5. Saturn's North Polar Hexagon: 10
6. Tornado: 0
7. Snow devil: 1
8. Steam devil: 1

Wait, but need to make sure the scores are spread out. Maybe adjust some. Let's see:

Hadley cell is a circulation cell, not a vortex or storm, so maybe 1. 

Fire whirl is a vortex but Earth, so 1. 

Dust devil is similar but maybe a bit more structured? Maybe 1. 

Saturn's Hexagon is definitely 10. 

Others are 0. 

Wait, the anti-examples are hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones. The candidates include tornado, waterspout, etc., which are similar to those anti-examples, so they should be 0. 

So:

1. Hadley cell: 1 or 2. Since it's a large-scale atmospheric feature but not a vortex or storm, maybe 2. 

2. Fire whirl: 1.

3. Waterspout: 0.

4. Dust devil: 1.

5. Saturn's: 10.

6. Tornado: 0.

7. Snow devil: 1.

8. Steam devil:1.

But need to use the full range. Maybe Hadley cell gets 3? Because it's a large-scale system, but not a vortex or storm. Hmm, maybe 2.

Alternatively, maybe the polar vortex example includes a vortex, so Hadley cell isn't a vortex. So 1.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "planetary-scale vortices or storms in the atmospheres of gas giants or other planets." So the key elements are: planetary-scale, vortex/storm, on another planet (not Earth). 

So for each candidate:

1. Hadley cell: Earth's atmospheric cell, not a vortex or storm. 0? Or 1.

2. Fire whirl: Earth, vortex but small, transient. 0.

3. Waterspout: Earth, tornado over water. 0.

4. Dust devil: Earth, small, transient. 0.

5. Saturn's Hexagon: planetary, persistent, Saturn. 10.

6. Tornado: Earth, 0.

7. Snow devil: same as dust devil, 0.

8. Steam devil: same, 0.

Wait, but the anti-examples are hurricanes etc. So the candidates like tornado, waterspout are in that category, so they get 0.

Hadley cell: maybe 1 because it's a large-scale atmospheric feature but not a storm. Since the examples are all storms/vortices. So not matching the theme. So 1?

Alternatively, maybe the polar vortex is considered a vortex, so Hadley cell isn't a vortex, so 0. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "long-lived, large atmospheric features on planets (excluding Earth)." Then Hadley cells are on Earth, so 0. But then the hexagon is 10. The others: fire whirl etc. 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all "Great" storms or polar vortices. Saturn's hexagon is similar. The others are Earth-based, so 0 except for the hexagon.

So perhaps the scores are:

1. 0 (Hadley cell on Earth, not a storm/vortex)

2. 0 (fire whirl)

3. 0 (waterspout)

4. 0 (dust devil)

5. 10 (Saturn's Hexagon)

6. 0 (tornado)

7. 0 (snow devil)

8. 0 (steam devil)

But that would give only 0 and 10, which is polarized. The user wants a granular scale. 

Wait, perhaps the polar vortex on Venus is a vortex, so maybe other vortices on other planets could get higher scores. For example, maybe the Hadley cell isn't a vortex, so 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the North Pole Hexagon is a vortex? I think it's a hexagonal cloud pattern, not a vortex, but it's a stable feature. So still 10.

Maybe the fire whirl is a vortex but Earth-based, so 1. 

Dust devil is a vortex but Earth, so 1. 

Hadley cell is not a vortex, so 0. 

Steam devil is a vortex but Earth, so 1. 

Snow devil same as dust devil, so 1.

Thus:

1. 0

2. 1

3. 0

4. 1

5. 10

6. 0

7. 1

8. 1

This way, there's some variation. 

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is 10, and others like dust devil etc. get 1, but Hadley cell 0.

This uses the full range a bit more. 

Alternatively, if I think that the Hadley cell is part of Earth's climate, but the examples are planetary features on other planets. So they get 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the polar vortex on Venus is a specific type of vortex, so other planetary vortices would get higher. But the anti-examples are Earth's hurricanes etc. So only Saturn's hexagon (if it's a vortex) gets 10. But I'm not sure if the hexagon is a vortex. 

Alternatively, maybe the North Polar Hexagon on Saturn is considered a vortex? I think it's a stable cloud pattern with a hexagonal shape, possibly related to atmospheric dynamics. Maybe it's considered a vortex-like feature, so definitely a 10.

The others, like Hadley cells are not vortices. 

Thus, the scores would be:

1. Hadley cell: 0

2. Fire whirl: 1

3. Waterspout: 0

4. Dust devil: 1

5. Saturn's: 10

6. Tornado: 0

7. Snow devil: 1

8. Steam devil:1

This way, there are 0,1, and 10. Maybe adjust some to have more in between. 

Alternatively, maybe the polar vortex is a vortex, so any vortex on a planet (not Earth) would get higher. But the candidates don't have such. The only one is Saturn's hexagon. 

Alternatively, maybe the Great Dark Spot and Red Spot are anticyclonic storms. So perhaps other large storms on planets like Jupiter's other spots? But the candidates don't have those. 

Alternatively, maybe "Great Red Spot" is a storm, so other storms on planets like maybe a hypothetical one on Uranus? But candidates don't have that. 

Thus, the only candidate that fits is Saturn's North Polar Hexagon, which is a planetary-scale feature. 

So the rest get 0 except for that. But the user wants the scores to be more nuanced. 

Wait, perhaps the Hadley cell is a large-scale atmospheric feature, but not a vortex or storm. Since the examples are all storms/vortices, maybe the theme is specifically storms or vortices, so Hadley cell is a 0. 

Fire whirl, dust devil, etc. are vortices but on Earth, so 1? 

Thus, the scores would be:

1. 0

2. 1

3. 0

4. 1

5. 10

6. 0

7. 1

8. 1

This way, the scores are 0,1,10. Maybe to get more spread, perhaps some others get 2?

Alternatively, maybe the polar vortex on Venus is a polar feature, so maybe other polar features on planets would score higher. For example, if there was a polar vortex on another planet, but the candidates don't have that. 

Alternatively, maybe the North Polar Hexagon is a polar feature, so that's why it's 10. 

In that case, maybe other polar features would score higher, but there are none here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "large, stable, planetary atmospheric features named with 'Great' or 'Polar'". But the anti-examples don't have that. 

Alternatively, the theme is "long-lived, large-scale storms or vortices in the atmospheres of gas giants or other planets, excluding Earth's transient weather systems". 

So, the key points: 

- Long-lived: the examples are persistent features. 

- Large-scale: cover significant area of the planet. 

- On another planet (not Earth). 

- Vortex/storm in atmosphere. 

So, the only candidate that fits all is Saturn's hexagon (assuming it's a storm or vortex). 

The others:

Hadley cell: Earth, not a storm or vortex. 0.

Fire whirl: Earth, small, transient. 0 or 1.

Dust devil: same, 1?

Wait, but maybe the anti-examples are hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones, which are Earth's storms. So the candidates like tornado, waterspout are in the same category as anti-examples, so they get 0. 

Fire whirl, dust devil, snow devil, steam devil are all Earth-based small vortices, so they are in the same vein as anti-examples but maybe a bit less. Maybe 1. 

So the scores would be:

1. Hadley cell: 0

2. Fire whirl: 1

3. Waterspout: 0

4. Dust devil: 1

5. Saturn's: 10

6. Tornado: 0

7. Snow devil: 1

8. Steam devil:1

This gives a spread from 0 to 10, with some 1s. 

Alternatively, maybe Hadley cell gets 2 because it's a large-scale atmospheric feature, even if not a storm. 

Alternatively, maybe the polar vortex on Venus is a vortex, so any vortex on a planet (even Earth's) but the anti-examples are Earth's storms. 

But the anti-examples are hurricanes, etc., so the theme excludes Earth's storms but allows other planetary vortices. 

So, if there's a vortex on another planet, it would score higher. The only such is Saturn's hexagon. 

But maybe the hexagon is not a vortex, so perhaps there's nothing else. 

Alternatively, maybe the North Polar Hexagon is considered a vortex. I need to recall: the hexagon is a stable cloud pattern around Saturn's north pole, maintained by atmospheric dynamics. It's a wave-like structure, perhaps a standing wave, so not exactly a vortex but a persistent feature. 

In that case, it might still be considered under the theme. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with the scores as:

1. 0

2. 1

3. 0

4. 1

5. 10

6. 0

7. 1

8. 1

But the user wants to use the full range. Maybe some of the others can get 2? 

Alternatively, perhaps the Hadley cell is a large-scale atmospheric circulation, which is a system, so maybe 2. 

Fire whirl is a vortex, so 2?

Wait, but the examples are all on other planets. So unless the candidate is on another planet, they can't get a high score. 

The only one on another planet is Saturn's hexagon. 

So the rest are Earth-based, so their max is 1. 

Therefore, the scores are as above. 

So the final scores would be:

<number>1</number><score>0</score>

<number>2</number><score>1</score>

<number>3</number><score>0</score>

<number>4</number><score>1</score>

<number>5</number><score>10</score>

<number>6</number><score>0</score>

<number>7</number><score>1</score>

<number>8</number><score>1</score>

But let me check again:

Hadley cell is Earth-based, so 0. 

Fire whirl is Earth-based vortex, so 1.

Waterspout is Earth, 0.

Dust devil, same as fire whirl? 1.

Saturn's: 10.

Tornado: 0.

Snow devil: 1.

Steam devil:1.

Yes.
