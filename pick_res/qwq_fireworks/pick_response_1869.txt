Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given: Nelson Mandela, John F. Kennedy, and Mahatma Gandhi. All three are historical figures known for their roles in political or social change, particularly in the context of leadership during significant movements. Mandela led the fight against apartheid, JFK was a U.S. president during the Cold War and civil rights era, and Gandhi led India's independence movement. They all share a commonality of being political leaders involved in major national or global issues through non-violent or political means, though JFK was a head of state.

Now, the anti-examples are Martin Luther King Jr., Confucius, and Albert Einstein. MLK is also a civil rights leader, which might seem similar, but perhaps the specific theme excludes him for some reasonâ€”maybe because he wasn't a head of state? Confucius is a philosopher, and Einstein a scientist. So the anti-examples include figures from philosophy and science, which are excluded from the specific theme. The key here is that the theme is more about political leaders who were heads of state or pivotal in national liberation, rather than activists, philosophers, or scientists.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Isaac Newton: A scientist, so likely a 0 or low score since the theme seems to exclude scientists.
2. Marie Curie: Also a scientist, so similar to Newton, probably a 0 or low.
3. Thomas Edison: Inventor, not a political leader, so maybe 0-2.
4. Plato: Philosopher, like Confucius, so excluded, maybe 0-2.
5. Socrates: Philosopher, same as Plato, so 0-2.
6. Charles Darwin: Scientist, so low score.
7. George Washington: Founding father and first U.S. president. This fits the political leader theme, similar to JFK. Maybe a 9 or 10? But wait, JFK was a president during a different era. Washington led the country's founding, so perhaps a strong match.
8. Benjamin Franklin: Also a founding father, but not a president during a major crisis like JFK or Mandela's roles. He was more of a statesman and inventor. Maybe a 6-7?

Wait, but let me think again. The examples are Mandela (leader of a liberation movement), JFK (president during critical events), Gandhi (leader of independence movement). So maybe the theme is leaders who were pivotal in their country's major historical struggles, possibly through political leadership or leading a movement. Franklin was a key figure in the founding, but perhaps not as directly a head of state during a major crisis. Washington was the first president, leading the country's establishment, so that's a strong match. Franklin might be a bit lower because he wasn't a head of state but was a key diplomat and thinker.

So adjusting the scores:

1. Isaac Newton: 0 (scientist)
2. Marie Curie: 0 (scientist)
3. Thomas Edison: 0 (inventor)
4. Plato: 0 (philosopher)
5. Socrates: 0 (philosopher)
6. Charles Darwin: 0 (scientist)
7. George Washington: 10 (founding father and president, pivotal leader)
8. Benjamin Franklin: Maybe 7? He was a Founding Father, diplomat, but not a head of state during a major crisis like Washington was. Or maybe 6?

Wait, but JFK was a president during his term, so Washington as the first president is a direct match. Franklin was more of a statesman and inventor. So maybe Franklin gets a 5? Or perhaps 6. Alternatively, since the anti-examples include MLK (who was an activist, not head of state), maybe Franklin's role as a statesman is closer but not exactly the same as JFK or Mandela. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is leaders who were heads of state or prominent in leading a nation's independence. So Washington and Franklin both contributed to founding the US, but Washington was the leader during the Revolutionary War and first president. Franklin was an important figure but not the head. So maybe Washington is a 10, Franklin a 7. Let's go with that.

Similarly, other candidates:

Plato and Socrates are philosophers, so 0. Newton, Curie, Edison, Darwin are scientists, 0. MLK is an activist but excluded, so the candidates like Franklin are in the middle.

Wait, the anti-examples include MLK, so maybe the theme excludes activists who aren't heads of state. Franklin wasn't a head of state but was a key political figure, so maybe a 6?

So final scores:

1. Isaac Newton: 0
2. Marie Curie: 0
3. Thomas Edison: 0
4. Plato: 0
5. Socrates: 0
6. Charles Darwin: 0
7. George Washington: 10
8. Benjamin Franklin: 7

Wait, but the user wants the scores to use the full range, so maybe adjust some of the lower ones to 1 or 2 instead of 0? Let me see the anti-examples. The anti-examples are MLK (activist), Confucius (philosopher), Einstein (scientist). The theme is leaders who were heads of state or leading a nation's movement. So the candidates not in that category get 0-2. Maybe give some of them 1 or 2 instead of all 0?

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "leaders who were heads of state or key figures in national independence movements". Then Washington is a 10, Franklin maybe a 7 (since he was a key figure but not head of state), others like scientists/philosophers get 0-2. But to spread out the scores, maybe:

Plato and Socrates: 1

Edison, Newton, Curie, Darwin: 1 or 2.

Franklin: 6-7

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be granular, so maybe:

1. Isaac Newton: 1 (scientist, but maybe a bit more than 0?)

2. Marie Curie: 1

3. Thomas Edison: 2 (inventor, maybe slightly closer to Franklin's role but not political)

4. Plato: 1

5. Socrates: 1

6. Charles Darwin: 1

7. George Washington: 10

8. Benjamin Franklin: 7 (since he was a Founding Father but not president during major crisis like Washington)

This way, the scores use a range from 1 to 10. Alternatively, maybe Edison gets a 2 because he's an inventor, which is different from scientists. Hmm, but the anti-examples include Einstein, so maybe all scientists are 1. Edison's an inventor, so maybe 2?

Alternatively, let's see:

Since the examples are all political leaders, and the anti-examples include non-political figures, the candidates outside of political leadership get 0-2. So:

1. Isaac Newton: 0 (scientist)
2. Marie Curie: 0 (scientist)
3. Thomas Edison: 0 (inventor)
4. Plato: 0 (philosopher)
5. Socrates: 0 (philosopher)
6. Charles Darwin: 0 (scientist)
7. George Washington: 10 (exact match)
8. Benjamin Franklin: 7 (key political figure but not head of state during major crisis)

Alternatively, maybe Franklin gets a 6? Or 8? Let me think again. Franklin was a diplomat, helped draft the Declaration of Independence, and was a key figure in the founding. He wasn't president during a major crisis like JFK, but his role was crucial. Maybe 8? Wait, but Mandela and Gandhi were leaders of movements, JFK as president. Franklin wasn't a head of state but was a key leader. Maybe 7 is fair.

I think this makes sense. So the final scores would be as above.
