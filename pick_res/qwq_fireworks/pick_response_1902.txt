Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided three examples (Bora Bora, Cook Islands, Fiji) and three anti-examples (Tahiti, Samoa, Tonga). The task is to determine a specific theme from the examples and then score new candidates based on how well they fit that theme, avoiding the broader or related themes that include the anti-examples.

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is. Let's look at the examples: Bora Bora, Cook Islands, Fiji. 

Bora Bora is a French Polynesian island, part of French Polynesia. The Cook Islands are a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand, also in the South Pacific. Fiji is an independent country in Melanesia. 

The anti-examples are Tahiti (which is part of French Polynesia, like Bora Bora), Samoa (independent and part of Polynesia), and Tonga (another Polynesian country). 

Hmm, so why are Tahiti, Samoa, and Tonga considered anti-examples? Maybe the specific theme excludes certain regions or has a particular political status? Let's see:

Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia (an overseas collectivity of France), Cook Islands are in free association with New Zealand, and Fiji is independent. Wait, but Samoa and Tonga are also independent. So maybe political status isn't the key.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is about specific island groups. Let's note:

- Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia, which is in Oceania, specifically Polynesia.
- Cook Islands are also in Polynesia.
- Fiji is in Melanesia. Wait, that's a different region. Hmm, maybe that complicates things.

Wait, maybe the theme is about islands that are either overseas territories or have a certain colonial history. But Fiji is independent. Alternatively, perhaps the key is that all examples are island groups that are destinations known for tourism, but that's too broad.

Alternatively, looking at the anti-examples: Tahiti is part of French Polynesia, so why is it excluded? Since Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia, but Tahiti is also part of the same region. Maybe the specific theme excludes the main islands and focuses on smaller, more remote ones? But Cook Islands is a country, not a smaller island. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is about island groups that are French overseas territories? But Fiji isn't French. Wait, Bora Bora is French, Cook Islands are associated with New Zealand, Fiji is independent. That doesn't fit. 

Another angle: looking at the examples, all three are island groups in the South Pacific. The anti-examples are also South Pacific islands. So that's not it. 

Wait, maybe the theme is about specific island chains that are part of a larger region but are not the main islands. For instance, Bora Bora is part of the Society Islands, which include Tahiti. But Tahiti is the main island. So maybe the theme is "islands that are part of a group but not the main island"? So Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia but not the capital (Tahiti is the main one). The Cook Islands are a country, but perhaps the main island is Rarotonga, so other islands there might count. Fiji is an independent country, so maybe the theme is about being a country in the Pacific but not the main islands? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "island groups that are French overseas territories, except the main ones like Tahiti". But then Cook Islands and Fiji don't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the key is that the examples are all island destinations known for resorts and tourism, but not the political entities. Alternatively, maybe it's about the islands being part of a country but not the capital. For example, Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia (capital Papeete in Tahiti), Cook Islands (capital Avarua in Rarotonga), Fiji's capital is Suva. So the examples are islands within those countries but not the capitals. The anti-examples are the main islands (Tahiti, Samoa's main islands, Tonga's main islands). So the theme is "non-capital islands of Pacific island nations/territories".

Testing this hypothesis:

- Bora Bora: not the capital of French Polynesia (Tahiti is)
- Cook Islands: the country itself, but maybe the example is referring to a specific island within it that's not the capital? Wait, Cook Islands as a country. Maybe the user meant a specific island there. Alternatively, perhaps the theme is countries that are island nations but not part of a larger territory. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all island groups that are part of French Polynesia, Cook Islands (a separate country), and Fiji. The anti-examples include Tahiti (part of French Polynesia), Samoa (a separate country), and Tonga (another country). Wait, that doesn't form a clear theme. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "island groups in Oceania that are not sovereign states". Let's see:

- Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia (overseas collectivity of France) → not sovereign.
- Cook Islands: self-governing in free association with NZ → has some sovereignty but not fully independent? Wait, actually, the Cook Islands are a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand, so they are considered a sovereign country. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the Cook Islands are a British Overseas Territory? No, they are in free association but not a territory. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "island groups that are part of French Polynesia, Cook Islands, or Fiji". But the anti-examples include other islands in those regions, like Tahiti (same as French Polynesia), so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "island groups that are French overseas collectivities, except Tahiti". But that would exclude Tahiti, but Cook Islands and Fiji don't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's about island groups that are popular tourist destinations but not the main islands. For example, Bora Bora is a tourist spot in French Polynesia, but Tahiti is also a tourist spot. Maybe the theme is "luxury resort islands"? Then the anti-examples might be more mainstream or not as luxurious. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the examples and anti-examples again:

Examples: Bora Bora (French Polynesia), Cook Islands (country), Fiji (country).

Anti-examples: Tahiti (French Polynesia), Samoa (country), Tonga (country).

Wait, the difference between the examples and anti-examples is that the examples include a sub-region (Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia, which is part of the anti-example Tahiti's region), and the other examples are countries. The anti-examples are countries or main islands. Maybe the theme is "island groups that are either sub-national regions or island nations, but excluding the main islands or primary sovereign entities". 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "island destinations that are part of a larger region but are not the main island". For instance:

- Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia but not the main island (Tahiti)
- Cook Islands is a country, but maybe the example refers to its islands (like Rarotonga is the main one, but other islands in the group)
- Fiji is a country, but maybe the example refers to its islands like Vanua Levu or Viti Levu? Wait, no, Fiji's main island is Viti Levu. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "island groups in the South Pacific that are part of French territories or former colonies, plus Fiji". But that seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, think of the examples as all being island countries or territories that are popular tourist destinations, but the anti-examples are also popular. So that might not help.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the examples are all island groups that are part of French Polynesia, the Cook Islands (which is a separate country), and Fiji. The anti-examples are other South Pacific islands but not part of those specific groupings. Wait, but the Cook Islands and Fiji are separate countries. So maybe the theme is "island nations or territories in the South Pacific that are either French, or Cook Islands, or Fiji". But the anti-examples are other countries like Samoa and Tonga, so they are excluded. 

So the specific theme would be "island nations or territories in the South Pacific that are either part of French Polynesia (like Bora Bora), the Cook Islands, or Fiji". Therefore, the anti-examples are other South Pacific islands not in these specific groups. 

Given that, let's look at the candidates:

1. New Caledonia: Part of French overseas territory. French Polynesia is another French territory, so maybe similar. But New Caledonia is a different territory. Since the examples include French Polynesia (Bora Bora), maybe New Caledonia would fit, but is it part of the specific theme? The anti-examples don't include New Caledonia, so maybe it's acceptable. So maybe score higher.

2. Vanuatu: Independent country in Melanesia. Not part of French Polynesia, Cook Islands, or Fiji. So it's another South Pacific island nation. Since the anti-examples include Samoa and Tonga (other nations), Vanuatu might also be an anti-example, but it's not listed. The theme includes Fiji (another independent country), so maybe Vanuatu is acceptable. Hmm.

Wait, the examples include Fiji as an independent country, so perhaps the theme allows for independent island nations. So Vanuatu would be similar to Fiji, so maybe acceptable. But need to see.

3. Palau: Independent country in Micronesia. Not in the same region as the examples (South Pacific vs Micronesia). So maybe lower score.

4. Maldives: Indian Ocean, not South Pacific. Definitely out of region.

5. Whitsunday Islands: Part of Australia (Queensland). So part of Australia, not an independent or French territory. But the examples include Fiji (a country), so maybe the theme includes Australian islands? Not sure. The Whitsundays are part of Australia, so perhaps a lower score.

6. Easter Island: Part of Chile, located in the Pacific. Not in the same region as the examples (east of Polynesia?), but it's a French Polynesian outlier? Wait, Easter Island is Chilean, part of Polynesia but politically part of Chile. Since the examples include French Polynesia, maybe it's somewhat related, but the anti-examples don't have it. Maybe a moderate score?

7. Solomon Islands: Independent country in Melanesia. Similar to Fiji (also Melanesia). Since Fiji is an example, Solomon Islands might fit. The anti-examples include Tonga (Polynesia), but not Solomon. So maybe higher score.

8. Hawaii: US state, part of the US. Not an independent country or French territory. So probably not fitting the theme, which includes Fiji (independent), Cook Islands (independent?), and French Polynesia (overseas). So Hawaii might be an anti-example because it's a US state, similar to how Tahiti is part of French Polynesia but maybe the examples include Bora Bora (a sub-region) but not the main island. Wait, Hawaii is a state, so maybe considered too integrated into a major country, hence lower score.

Now, scoring each candidate:

1. New Caledonia: Part of French overseas, similar to French Polynesia (Bora Bora is part of that). Since the examples include Bora Bora, which is French, New Caledonia would fit. So maybe 8 or 9. But since the anti-examples don't mention it, but it's another French territory. Since the theme might specifically be the examples given, maybe it's a good fit. Wait, but the anti-examples include Tahiti (French Polynesia's main island), so maybe New Caledonia is okay. Let's say 8.

Wait, but maybe the theme excludes French territories' main islands. New Caledonia's main island is Grande Terre, but the territory as a whole is a French collectivity. Since Bora Bora is part of French Polynesia but not the main island (Tahiti), maybe New Caledonia as a territory would be acceptable. So maybe 7 or 8.

2. Vanuatu: Independent, in Melanesia like Fiji. Since Fiji is an example, Vanuatu is similar. So maybe 8 or 9. But the anti-examples include Samoa and Tonga, which are Polynesian. Vanuatu is Melanesian, so maybe acceptable. So 8.

3. Palau: Micronesia. Not part of the same region as the examples (South Pacific/Melanesia). So lower. Maybe 3-4.

4. Maldives: Indian Ocean, far from South Pacific. Definitely out. 0 or 1.

5. Whitsunday Islands: Part of Australia. Not an independent nation or French territory. Since the examples include Fiji (independent), but Australia is a major country. So maybe 2-3.

6. Easter Island: Part of Chile, but in Polynesia. The examples include French Polynesia (Bora Bora) and Cook Islands (Polynesian). Easter Island is Chilean Polynesian. Since the anti-examples include Tahiti (French), but Easter is a different country's territory. Maybe 5 or 6.

7. Solomon Islands: Independent Melanesian nation like Fiji. So maybe 9 or 10. But Fiji is an example, so Solomon should be similar. Let's say 9.

8. Hawaii: US state, so part of a major country. The examples include Fiji (independent) and Cook Islands (independent?), so Hawaii as a state might not fit. Maybe 2.

Wait, but Cook Islands are in free association with NZ, but still a sovereign country. Hawaii is a state, so more integrated. So lower score. Maybe 2.

But let me recheck. The examples are Bora Bora (French), Cook Islands (sovereign but in free association), Fiji (sovereign). So the theme allows for sovereign nations and French territories. Hawaii is a US state, so not sovereign. Thus, it's more like a part of a major country, similar to how Tahiti is part of French Polynesia, which is part of France. Since Tahiti is an anti-example, Hawaii would also be an anti-example? But the anti-examples are Tahiti, Samoa, Tonga. So Hawaii isn't listed, but it's similar to Tahiti in being part of a larger country. So maybe Hawaii should be a 0 or 1? Or maybe 2?

Alternatively, maybe the anti-examples are other sovereign countries, so Hawaii isn't, so it's worse. Let me think again.

Wait, the anti-examples are Tahiti (part of French Polynesia, so similar to Bora Bora), Samoa (sovereign country), and Tonga (sovereign country). So the theme excludes the main islands (Tahiti) and other sovereign countries (Samoa, Tonga). So the examples are either non-main islands (Bora Bora) or sovereign nations (Cook Islands, Fiji). Wait, but Cook Islands is sovereign (in free association), so maybe the theme is "sovereign island nations or non-main islands of French territories". 

Thus, the criteria are:

- Sovereign island nations (Cook Islands, Fiji)
- Non-main islands of French Polynesia (Bora Bora)

So, the anti-examples are:

- Tahiti (main island of French Polynesia)
- Samoa (sovereign, but excluded for some reason? Wait, Samoa is a sovereign country, same as Cook Islands and Fiji. So why is it an anti-example?)

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the anti-examples are other sovereign island nations besides Cook Islands and Fiji? So the theme is "sovereign island nations in Polynesia (Cook Islands) and Melanesia (Fiji), plus non-main French Polynesian islands (Bora Bora)". The anti-examples include Samoa (Polynesian sovereign), Tonga (Polynesian sovereign), and Tahiti (main French island). So the theme excludes other Polynesian sovereign nations, only allowing Cook Islands and Fiji (but Fiji is Melanesian). 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "island groups that are either part of French Polynesia (excluding Tahiti) or sovereign nations in Melanesia (Fiji) and Polynesia (Cook Islands)". 

Thus, the candidates:

1. New Caledonia: French territory, but in Melanesia. The examples include Fiji (Melanesian sovereign) and French Polynesia (Bora Bora). New Caledonia is French but Melanesian. Maybe it's included as a French territory in Melanesia, so similar to Fiji? Not sure. Maybe 6 or 7.

2. Vanuatu: Melanesian sovereign, like Fiji. So should fit, so 10? But the anti-examples don't include it, so maybe 9.

3. Palau: Micronesia, not part of the regions mentioned. 0-2.

4. Maldives: Indian Ocean, 0.

5. Whitsundays: Part of Australia, not sovereign. 1.

6. Easter Island: Chilean Polynesian, not French. Since the theme includes French Polynesia's sub-islands, but Easter is Chilean, maybe 3.

7. Solomon Islands: Melanesian sovereign, like Fiji. So 10? But maybe 9 because Fiji is the example, so others in same region are similar.

8. Hawaii: US state, so not sovereign. 0 or 1.

But I need to ensure the scores are spread out and use the full range. Let me try to assign scores based on this reasoning:

1. New Caledonia: French in Melanesia. Since Fiji is a Melanesian sovereign, but New C is French, maybe 6.

2. Vanuatu: Melanesian sovereign. 9.

3. Palau: Micronesia, 2.

4. Maldives: 0.

5. Whitsundays: 1.

6. Easter: 3.

7. Solomon Islands: 9.

8. Hawaii: 1.

Wait, but maybe Vanuatu and Solomon both get 9. Let's see:

Alternatively, maybe the theme is more about the specific examples given, so New Caledonia isn't part of them, so lower. Maybe 5.

Alternatively, if the theme is sovereign island nations in Melanesia (Fiji) and Polynesia (Cook Islands) plus French Polynesian non-main islands, then:

- New Caledonia is French (but not Polynesian?), so maybe not.

Wait, New Caledonia is in Melanesia, French territory. Since Fiji is a sovereign Melanesian nation, New Caledonia is a French territory there. Maybe not included. So lower score, like 4.

Vanuatu as sovereign Melanesian, 9.

Palau: 2.

Maldives:0.

Whitsundays:1.

Easter:3.

Solomon:9.

Hawaii:1.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "island groups in the South Pacific that are either part of French Polynesia (except Tahiti), Cook Islands, or Fiji". So:

1. New Caledonia: Not French Polynesia, so no. Score 3.

2. Vanuatu: Not in the list, but near Fiji. Maybe 5?

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should think of it as the examples are all island destinations in the South Pacific that are either part of French Polynesia (Bora Bora), Cook Islands (country), or Fiji (country). The anti-examples are other South Pacific destinations (Tahiti, Samoa, Tonga) that are either the main islands or other countries. So the theme is "island destinations in the South Pacific that are part of French Polynesia (but not Tahiti), Cook Islands, or Fiji". 

Thus:

1. New Caledonia: French but not part of French Polynesia → no. Score 2.

2. Vanuatu: Independent, not part of the three regions → 3.

3. Palau: Micronesia → 0.

4. Maldives: Indian Ocean → 0.

5. Whitsundays: Australia → 1.

6. Easter: Chilean Polynesian, not French → 2.

7. Solomon Islands: Melanesia, but not Fiji → 4? Or since it's near Fiji, maybe 5?

8. Hawaii: US → 0.

Wait, but this is inconsistent. Alternatively, the examples include Fiji (Melanesia), Cook Islands (Polynesia), and Bora Bora (French Polynesia). The anti-examples are other countries in Polynesia (Samoa, Tonga) and Tahiti (main French Polynesian). So the theme is "islands in the South Pacific that are either part of French Polynesia (except Tahiti), the Cook Islands, or Fiji". Thus:

1. New Caledonia: Not French Polynesia → 0.

2. Vanuatu: Not Fiji, Cook, or French Polynesia → 1.

3. Palau: 0.

4. Maldives: 0.

5. Whitsundays: 0.

6. Easter: Not French Polynesia → 0.

7. Solomon Islands: Not Fiji, so 1.

8. Hawaii: 0.

But this gives too many zeros. The user wants a graded scale from 0-10.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "South Pacific island destinations that are either French Polynesian (non-Tahiti), Cook Islands, or Fiji". Thus:

- New Caledonia: French but not Polynesia → 2.

- Vanuatu: Near Fiji but not Fiji → 3.

- Palau: 0.

- Maldives:0.

- Whitsundays: part of Australia, so 1.

- Easter: Chilean, 2.

- Solomon Islands: near Fiji, but not Fiji → 4.

- Hawaii: 0.

Hmm, but this still low. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternative approach: the examples are all island groups that are known for being part of French Polynesia (Bora Bora), the Cook Islands (a country), and Fiji (a country). The anti-examples include Tahiti (main French Polynesian), Samoa (another country), and Tonga (another country). So the theme is "island groups that are either part of French Polynesia (excluding Tahiti) or are sovereign nations in the South Pacific (Cook Islands, Fiji)". 

Thus:

1. New Caledonia: French territory but not part of French Polynesia → 2.

2. Vanuatu: Sovereign South Pacific → 8 (since Cook and Fiji are sovereign, Vanuatu is similar).

3. Palau: Micronesia → 1.

4. Maldives: 0.

5. Whitsundays: part of Australia → 1.

6. Easter: Chilean → 2.

7. Solomon Islands: Sovereign South Pacific → 9 (like Fiji).

8. Hawaii: US → 0.

This uses a better spread. Let me adjust:

Vanuatu and Solomon would be high because they're sovereign in the region. New Caledonia is French but in wrong region. Easter is Chilean, so maybe 2.

So final scores:

1. New Caledonia → 3

2. Vanuatu → 8

3. Palau → 2

4. Maldives →0

5. Whitsundays →1

6. Easter →3

7. Solomon →9

8. Hawaii →0

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Maybe adjust some more:

Maybe Solomon is 10? But Fiji is an example, so maybe 9 is okay. 

Alternatively, if the theme allows any sovereign South Pacific nation except Samoa and Tonga, then Vanuatu and Solomon would be 10. But since the anti-examples are Samoa and Tonga, maybe others are okay. But the examples include Fiji and Cook, so other sovereign nations are acceptable. Hence:

Vanuatu and Solomon would be 10, but since the user wants to exclude the anti-examples (Samoa, Tonga, Tahiti), maybe others are okay. 

But the examples include Fiji and Cook, so any other sovereign South Pacific would be okay. Thus:

Vanuatu:10, Solomon:10. But the user wants to avoid polarization, so maybe 9 and 8.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused but will proceed with the best guess based on the theme being sovereign South Pacific nations (excluding Samoa and Tonga) and French Polynesian non-Tahiti islands.
