Okay, let me start by understanding the specific theme from the examples given. The examples all involve buildings constructed using materials sourced locally. The first example is a community center with bricks made from nearby riverbed clay. The second is a school using sand and gravel from a local pit. The third is a house with locally quarried stone and timber from nearby forests. So the common theme here is the use of locally sourced materials, specifically from very near the construction siteâ€”like the immediate vicinity or nearby natural resources.

Now, the anti-examples are the ones that don't fit the exact theme but might be part of a broader category. They include imported materials from distant locations. For instance, the cottage with imported tropical hardwoods, the library with timber from another continent, and the museum with marble from a distant mountain. These are clearly using non-local materials, so the key distinction is the proximity and source of the materials.

The task is to evaluate each candidate on a 0-10 scale based on how well they match the specific theme of using locally sourced materials, not just any local materials but from very nearby sources. The scores should be nuanced, not just 0 or 10. 

Let's go through each candidate one by one.

1. **Hospital with locally sourced materials but imported steel.**
   The main materials are local, but they added imported steel. Since steel isn't mentioned in the original examples, but the key is local sourcing. However, if most materials are local except for steel, maybe it's a partial match. The presence of imported material reduces the score. Maybe a 3? Because it's mostly local but with some imported elements.

2. **Office building using glass from a different state.**
   The state is a broader area, so if the original examples are about nearby sources (like same region or within a short distance), then a different state would be too far. But maybe if the state isn't too big? Hmm. The anti-examples mention another continent and distant mountain ranges, so a different state might be considered a broader theme. So maybe a 2? But maybe a 4? Not sure yet.

3. **Factory with aggregates from a quarry 50 miles away.**
   50 miles is a bit far, but maybe still considered local in some contexts? The original examples didn't specify exact distances, but "nearby" might imply closer, like within a few miles or same region. So 50 miles might be a bit too far. Maybe a 5 or 6? 

4. **Skyscraper with steel from across the country.**
   Across the country is definitely distant, so this is like the anti-examples. That's a 0 or 1. But maybe 1 if there's a tiny local component? Probably a 0 or 1. Since steel is the main material here, and it's from far away, so 1?

5. **Theater with bricks from clay within 15 miles.**
   15 miles is pretty close. The examples had "nearby" riverbed and local pit. 15 miles might be acceptable. This is a strong match. So maybe 8 or 9? The original examples didn't specify distance, but 15 is close, so maybe 9?

6. **Residential complex with bricks from another region.**
   Another region is more distant than local. The anti-examples include regions, so this would be a 2 or 3? Since "another region" is more than local. Maybe 3?

7. **Barn with wood from the farm's own property.**
   That's as local as possible. The materials are literally from the same property. Perfect match. So 10.

8. **Government building with local stone but imported granite facade.**
   The main material is local, but the facade uses imported granite. Similar to candidate 1. Since the facade is a significant part but not all materials. Maybe a 4? Since part is imported, so lower than 1's 3? Wait, the first one had local materials supplemented with imported steel. The government building uses local stone but imported granite for facade. Maybe 4? Or 3? Maybe similar to candidate 1's 3.

Wait, let me reassess each again carefully:

1. **Hospital: local materials except steel.** If the majority is local but a key component is imported, maybe 3. 

2. **Office building with glass from another state.** If the original theme is strict local (like within the same area or nearby), another state would be too far. So 2?

3. **50 miles quarry:** Maybe local in some contexts. If the original examples didn't specify distance, but "nearby" might be ambiguous. If 50 miles is considered a bit too far, maybe 5?

4. **Across country steel:** Definitely not local. 0 or 1. Maybe 1 because it's a building but materials are not local. But the theme requires materials to be local. So 0?

5. **15 miles clay:** Close, so 9 or 10? Since the examples had "nearby" which 15 miles is within that. Maybe 9 because it's specified as within 15, which is a clear local source.

6. **Another region bricks:** Region is broader, so 2?

7. **Farm's own property:** 10.

8. **Local stone but imported facade:** So main structure is local but facade is imported. Maybe 4? Since facade is part of the exterior but not the entire building. So lower than 5 but higher than 0. Maybe 4?

Wait, let me check the anti-examples again. The anti-examples include imported materials from distant places. The key is that the materials should be from the immediate vicinity. So for the government building, the main stone is local, but the facade is imported. Since facade is a part, but maybe the majority is still local. Maybe a 6? Hmm, maybe. If the main structure is local, but a significant part is imported, perhaps a 5? Or 4?

Alternatively, since the examples required all materials to be local, then having any imported material would lower the score. The first example had bricks from nearby, the school used local pit materials, the house used local stone and timber. So if any part is not local, it's a deduction. The hospital uses local materials but imported steel. So steel is structural, so maybe a bigger deduction. The government building's facade is granite from afar, which is part of the exterior. Maybe that's a 4? 

Let me try to assign scores again:

1. Hospital: Local materials + imported steel. Since steel is a key material, maybe 3.

2. Office: Glass from another state. State is more distant, so 2.

3. 50 miles quarry: 50 miles is a bit far, but maybe acceptable in some contexts. Maybe 5? Since it's still within the same country, but the original examples didn't specify. Alternatively, if "local" implies closer proximity, maybe 4?

4. Across country steel: 0.

5. 15 miles clay: 9.

6. Another region bricks: 2.

7. Farm property: 10.

8. Local stone + imported granite facade: 4.

Wait, for candidate 3, quarry 50 miles. The examples had "nearby pit" and "nearby riverbed". 50 miles is more than nearby, but maybe in some regions, 50 miles is considered local? Not sure. Maybe a 4?

Alternatively, maybe 5? Since it's still within the same state, perhaps?

Alternatively, if "local" is strictly immediate vicinity, then 50 miles is too far. So 3?

Hmm, this is tricky. Let's think: the examples didn't specify distance, but "nearby" implies proximity. 50 miles is about an hour's drive, maybe? Depending on location. But in the examples, the materials are from the same area (like riverbed nearby, local pit, nearby forests). So 50 miles might be a bit too far. So maybe 4?

Alternatively, maybe 5? Let's say 4.

So adjusting:

3. 4.

Then candidate 8: 4.

Candidate 2: 2.

Candidate 6: 2.

Candidate 4: 0.

Candidate 5: 9.

Candidate 7: 10.

Candidate 1: 3.

Now, check if all scores use the full range 0-10. The scores so far are 0,2,3,4,5 (if 3 is 4?), 9,10,4. Wait, for candidate 3, I thought 4. Let me see:

Wait, candidate 3's score was 4 (if I set it to 4), candidate 8 is 4. Candidate 2 is 2, 6 is 2, 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 4 is 0, 5 is 9, 7 is 10, 8 is 4. So the scores are 0,2,3,4,9,10, and 4 again. Missing some in between. Maybe candidate 3 can be 5?

Alternatively, perhaps the government building's imported facade is a more significant part. Maybe 3?

Wait, perhaps candidate 8: the facade is a part of the building's exterior, but the main structure uses local stone. So maybe it's a 5? Because the majority is local, but the facade is imported. Hmm.

Alternatively, since the facade is a key visible part, but the structural materials are local. Maybe 5?

Hmm, this is a bit subjective, but I need to assign scores as best as I can.

Let me try to finalize:

1. 3

2. 2

3. 4

4. 0

5. 9

6. 2

7. 10

8. 4

Wait, but that's missing some numbers. Let me check:

0 (4), 2 (2 and 6), 3 (1), 4 (3 and 8), 9 (5), 10 (7). So the scores from 0 to 10: 0, 2,3,4,9,10. Missing 1,5,6,7,8. Hmm, maybe I should adjust some.

Perhaps candidate 3 (50 miles quarry) is a 5? Because 50 is further than nearby but still within a reasonable distance for "local" in some cases. So 5.

Candidate 8: government building with imported facade. Maybe 5?

Candidate 2: office with glass from another state: maybe 3?

Wait, let's try again:

1. Hospital: 3 (local mostly, but steel imported)

2. Office (another state glass): 3 (since state is a larger area but maybe considered broader)

Wait, but the anti-examples have "another continent" and "distant mountain range". Another state might be a more general theme. Hmm.

Alternatively, another state is still within the country, but the examples didn't specify. Maybe 2?

3. Quarry 50 miles: 5.

4. Across country steel: 0.

5. 15 miles:9.

6. Another region:2.

7. 10.

8. Government building: maybe 5 (since facade is part but main structure is local).

So that gives:

1.3

2.2

3.5

4.0

5.9

6.2

7.10

8.5

Now the scores are 0,2,3,5,9,10,5. Still missing some numbers but better. Maybe candidate 8 is 5, candidate 3 is 5.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 8 is 4, candidate 3 is 5.

Alternatively, let me think of each candidate again:

Candidate 1: Hospital with local materials but imported steel. Since steel is a structural material, but the rest is local. So maybe a 4? Because it's mostly local except for a key component. Hmm, maybe 4.

Candidate 2: Office building using glass from another state. If another state is too far, then 1 or 2. Let's say 2.

Candidate 3: 50 miles quarry. Let's say 5.

Candidate4: 0.

Candidate5:9.

Candidate6: another region. 2.

Candidate7:10.

Candidate8: local stone but imported granite facade. So the facade is part of the exterior, but main materials are local. So maybe 6? Because the majority is still local, but a visible part is imported. Alternatively 5.

Hmm. Maybe I should think of the examples again. The examples required all materials to be from very nearby. So any imported material would lower the score. The more local, the higher.

So:

Candidate 1: most materials are local except steel. So maybe 7-8? Wait, no, the theme requires that the materials are from nearby. If they used local for most but imported steel, then it's a partial match. The examples didn't mention any exceptions. So maybe 3 or 4.

Candidate 5 is perfect (15 miles clay). So 9 or 10? Since the examples had "nearby" and 15 is within that, so 9? Or 10? The first example was "nearby riverbed" but didn't specify distance. If 15 is acceptable, maybe 10. But maybe 9 to leave 10 for the farm's own property.

Candidate7 is the barn with materials from the farm's own property. That's the closest possible, so 10.

Candidate8: local stone but imported granite facade. The facade is a part, so maybe 6? Because most is local but part is not. Alternatively, since the facade is a key feature, maybe it's a 5.

Alternatively, since the main structure is local, but the facade uses imported material. Maybe 6.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to assign the scores again with more precise thinking.

The key is that the specific theme is using materials from the immediate vicinity (local pit, nearby riverbed, nearby forests). So the closer the better. Any use of non-local materials reduces the score.

1. Hospital: local materials except imported steel. Steel is structural, so maybe 3.

2. Office with glass from another state: another state is too far, so 2.

3. Quarry 50 miles: 50 miles is further than "nearby", so maybe 4.

4. Steel from across country: 0.

5. 15 miles clay: very close, so 9.

6. Another region bricks: region is broader, so 2.

7. Farm's property: 10.

8. Local stone + imported facade: The main structure is local, but the facade uses imported granite. The facade is part of the building's exterior, but perhaps not the structural material. So maybe 6? Since the majority is local but a visible part is imported. Alternatively 5.

Alternatively, since the facade is a significant part, maybe 5.

Hmm. Let's go with 5 for candidate8.

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 2

3.4

4.0

5.9

6.2

7.10

8.5

That's 0,2,3,4,5,9,10. Missing some numbers, but it's okay as long as they are spread out. Maybe candidate3's 50 miles could be 5 instead of 4? Let me adjust:

3. Quarry 50 miles: 5.

Then candidate8 is 6.

Then scores would be:

3:5, 8:6.

That gives 0,2,3,5,6,9,10.

Still missing a few, but acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe candidate8 is 6.

Final decision:

1. 3

2. 2

3.5

4.0

5.9

6.2

7.10

8.6

Now the scores are 0,2,3,5,6,9,10. That's better.

Wait, candidate8: 6.

Yes, that's better. So:

Candidate8: Local stone (good), but imported granite for the facade. The facade is part of the exterior, so it's a significant component. Since the main structure is local, but the facade is imported, it's a moderate deduction. 6 seems reasonable.

Alright, I think this is the best I can do.
