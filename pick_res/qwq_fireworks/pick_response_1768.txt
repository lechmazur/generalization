Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the given examples. The examples are Garry Kasparov, Boris Gelfand, and Viswanathan Anand. All three are names of people, specifically chess players. Let me confirm their backgrounds. 

Garry Kasparov is a former World Chess Champion, Boris Gelfand is a Grandmaster who played in the World Chess Championship, and Viswanathan Anand is a former World Champion. So, the common theme here seems to be "World Chess Champions" or "Top-Level Chess Players/Grandmasters."

Now, looking at the anti-examples: a chess strategy book, a chess coach, and a chess commentator. These are all related to chess but not the specific individuals who are champions or top players. The anti-examples are objects or roles associated with chess but not the actual competitors at the highest level.

Next, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme. The key is to assign a score from 0 to 10 based on how closely they fit the exact theme (World Chess Champions/Top Grandmasters) without considering broader or related themes.

Let's go through each candidate one by one:

1. **a chess puzzle**: This is an exercise or problem in chess, not a person. Definitely not a World Champion. Score: 0 or maybe 1? But since it's an object, 0 seems right.

2. **a chess streamer**: A person who streams chess games online. Could be a player, but not necessarily a World Champion. It's a role, so not the exact theme. Maybe 2 or 3? Since it's a person but not specifically a top player.

3. **a chess tournament**: An event where chess is played. Not a person. Definitely 0. 

4. **Vladimir Kramnik**: He is a former World Chess Champion, so exactly fits the theme. 10.

5. **a chess endgame**: A phase of the game. Not a person. 0.

6. **a chess middlegame**: Another phase of the game. Also not a person. 0.

7. **a chess club**: An organization. Not a person. 0.

8. **a chess opening**: The starting phase of a game. Again, a concept, not a person. 0.

Wait a second, but maybe I need to check if any of these candidates could be people. For example, "chess streamer" could be a person, but unless they are a World Champion, they don't fit. Similarly, "chess club" is an organization. The only candidate that's a person and a World Champion is Vladimir Kramnik (4). The others are either phases, objects, or roles not tied to being a top player. 

Let me double-check each candidate again to ensure I haven't missed anything. 

1. Chess puzzle: definitely a problem, not a person. 0.

2. Chess streamer: person but role, not necessarily a GM or champion. Maybe 1? But since the examples are all specific champions, maybe even lower. Hmm, but the anti-examples include a coach and commentator, which are roles. So the theme is strictly the people who are champions. So streamer isn't that. So 0?

Wait, but the anti-examples are given as things that don't fit the exact theme but could fit a broader one. The anti-examples include roles (coach, commentator), so the theme must exclude roles. So a chess streamer is a role, so 0. 

Similarly, chess tournament is an event. So all except 4 are 0 except maybe some others? Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe I missed that Boris Gelfand is a Grandmaster but not a World Champion? Wait, Boris Gelfand was the challenger in the 2012 World Chess Championship against Anand but didn't win. Wait, actually, he did become World Champion in some capacity? Let me confirm:

Garry Kasparov: definitely a former World Champion.

Boris Gelfand: He was FIDE World Champion in 1996, but that's under the FIDE system when there was a split. However, he never won the classical World Championship. So maybe the theme is "top grandmasters" rather than strictly World Champions? Because Anand is a classical champion, Kasparov too. Hmm, but maybe the key is that all three are Grandmasters. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "people associated with chess championships" but not necessarily the champions themselves. Wait, but the anti-examples include "chess commentator" which is a role, so perhaps the theme is "chess players of high rank". 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "people who have held the World Chess Champion title". In that case, Boris Gelfand might not qualify. Wait, maybe I need to check:

Garry Kasparov: 1985-2000.

Viswanathan Anand: 2000-2002, 2007-2013, etc.

Boris Gelfand: He was FIDE World Champion in 1996, but that was during the time when there were two World Champions. So if the theme is classical World Champions, then Gelfand doesn't qualify. Wait, this might complicate things. 

Wait, maybe the key is that all three are grandmasters who have been top players, even if not all were champions. But the problem states the theme is specific, so maybe the examples are all grandmasters who have been World Champions or top contenders. Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "people with the surname ending with 'ov' or 'and' "? No, that's too silly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "former World Chess Champions". Let me check each:

Garry Kasparov: yes.

Viswanathan Anand: yes.

Boris Gelfand: No, he never won the classical World Championship. Wait, but in 2012, he was the challenger to Anand, who was the champion. So maybe the examples include challengers? But that's stretching. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "Grandmasters who have participated in World Chess Championship matches". Then Boris Gelfand did participate as a challenger. Anand was champion, Kasparov too. So maybe that's the theme. Then Vladimir Kramnik (candidate 4) is a former World Champion, so he fits. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all grandmasters from different countries? Kasparov (Russia), Gelfand (Israel), Anand (India). Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "people who have held the World Chess Championship title at some point". In that case, Boris Gelfand's 1996 title (FIDE) might count. But if the problem considers only the classical line, then he didn't. 

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The problem states that the three examples are part of the specific theme, and the anti-examples are not part of that exact theme. The anti-examples are objects or roles. So the theme must be about people who are chess players of high rank, possibly champions. 

Assuming that all three examples are indeed World Chess Champions (even if Gelfand's title was FIDE), then Vladimir Kramnik (4) is definitely a former World Champion (2006-2007 and 2008-2010), so he fits perfectly. 

The other candidates: 

1. Chess puzzle: 0.

2. Chess streamer: 0, as it's a role.

3. Tournament: 0.

5. Endgame: 0.

6. Middlegame: 0.

7. Club: 0.

8. Opening: 0.

Wait, but maybe "chess tournament" could be part of the theme? No, it's an event. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me consider another angle. The examples are all human names, so the theme must be people. The anti-examples are non-human (objects, roles). So the specific theme is "people associated with chess at a high level". But the anti-examples include roles (coach, commentator), which are people. So the exact theme must exclude those roles. 

Thus, the examples are all top players (champions or top contenders). So the theme is "top chess players who have competed at the highest level, such as World Champions or challengers". 

In that case, Vladimir Kramnik is a perfect 10. 

Now, what about other candidates? 

Looking at candidate 8: a chess opening. That's a phase, so 0. 

Candidate 2: a chess streamer. Could be a player, but unless they are a top player, it's not. Since the role is streaming, not necessarily their playing rank, it's a 0. 

Candidate 3: tournament is an event, 0.

Wait, what about candidate 4 is 10. The others are 0 except maybe someone else?

Wait, are there any other candidates that are people? Let me check again:

Candidates:

1. a chess puzzle (object)

2. a chess streamer (person, but role)

3. a chess tournament (event)

4. Vladimir Kramnik (person, top player)

5. a chess endgame (phase)

6. a chess middlegame (phase)

7. a chess club (organization)

8. a chess opening (phase)

So only candidate 4 is a person who fits the theme. The rest are not people except 2, but 2's role isn't the theme. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-express the theme again. The examples are three people who are top chess players, possibly World Champions. The anti-examples are roles or objects related to chess but not the players themselves. So the exact theme is "World Chess Champions" or "Top Grandmasters who have held World Championship titles or contested in them". 

Therefore, the only candidate that fits is 4. All others are either non-people or roles. 

Thus, the scores would be:

1. 0

2. 0

3. 0

4. 10

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

Wait, but the user said to use the full range of scores, not just 0 and 10. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. The user mentioned that the anti-examples can match a broader theme. So perhaps there are candidates that are closer but not exact. 

Wait, maybe the theme is "people associated with chess", but that's too broad. The examples are all top players. The anti-examples are roles (coach, commentator, book). So the theme must be "chess players of a certain caliber". 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "former World Chess Champions". Let me confirm each example:

- Garry Kasparov: yes.

- Viswanathan Anand: yes.

- Boris Gelfand: Did he ever hold the World Championship title? Let me check: 

Boris Gelfand was the FIDE World Champion in 1996, which was during the time when there were two World Championships (the classical and FIDE). So depending on the criteria, he might be considered a World Champion. However, he never won the classical line. If the theme requires the classical title, then he wouldn't qualify. But since he's listed as an example, maybe the theme includes FIDE champions as well. 

Assuming that, then the theme is "people who have held a World Chess Championship title (either classical or FIDE)". In that case, Boris Gelfand qualifies, so the theme includes those who have been World Champions. 

Now, looking at candidate 4: Vladimir Kramnik is a former classical World Champion, so 10. 

Candidate 8: a chess opening. Not a person. 0.

Wait, but what about candidate 2: a chess streamer? If the streamer is a top player, like Magnus Carlsen streams, but the candidate is "a chess streamer", which is a role. Unless the candidate is a specific person who is a streamer and a top player, but the candidate is the role, not a person. So still 0.

Wait, maybe there's another angle. The examples are all names of people, so the theme is "people who are chess players at the grandmaster level". The anti-examples are roles or objects. So candidates that are people but not grandmasters would get lower scores. But all the candidates except 4 are not people except 2, which is a role. 

Alternatively, maybe "chess player who has won a major tournament" or something. But without more info, I have to go with the initial thought. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "people with the last name ending in 'ov' or 'and'"? Gelfand (ends with 'and'), Kasparov (ends with 'ov'), Anand (ends with 'and'). But that's a stretch and probably not the intended theme. 

Alternatively, maybe they are all chess players who have played against each other in World Championships? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the theme could be "Grandmasters from different countries". But not sure. 

Given the strictest interpretation, the examples are top players, possibly World Champions. The only candidate fitting that is 4 (Vladimir Kramnik). The rest are either non-people or roles. 

But the user said to use the full range of scores, so maybe some candidates are closer but not exact. For instance, "chess tournament" (3) is an event where top players compete, but not a player. Maybe a 1? But the anti-examples include "chess strategy book" which is an object, so events might be 0. 

Alternatively, maybe "chess puzzle" (1) is a training tool for top players, but that's too indirect. 

Alternatively, maybe "chess opening" (8) is a component of the game that top players use, but still not the theme. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the anti-examples again. They include "a chess coach" which is a role related to teaching, so the theme excludes roles. 

Thus, the only candidate that's a person who is a top player is 4. All others are 0. But the user wants scores from 0-10, not just 0 and 10. Maybe I'm missing some nuances. 

Wait, maybe some candidates are people but not top players? Like, a chess streamer could be a Grandmaster who streams, but the candidate is the role, not a specific person. So unless the role inherently requires being a top player, but it's not. 

Alternatively, maybe "chess tournament" (3) is a place where such players compete, so maybe 1? But it's an event. 

Alternatively, the theme could be "things related to chess competitions". But the examples are people, so that's not it. 

Alternatively, the theme is "individuals who have competed in World Chess Championships". Then Boris Gelfand qualifies as a challenger. If so, then other candidates like a chess streamer doesn't, but maybe someone else? 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "people who have held the #1 world ranking in chess". Then Kasparov, Anand, and Gelfand (if he ever was #1). Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "former World Chess Champions" (regardless of classical vs FIDE). So Kasparov (yes), Anand (yes), Gelfand (FIDE champion, so yes). Then Vladimir Kramnik is a former champion, so 10. 

Other candidates: 

- a chess streamer: 0

- a chess tournament: 0

- chess puzzle: 0

- etc. 

But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe some candidates are partially related but not exact. For example, "chess tournament" (3) is an event where such champions play, so maybe 1. 

Or "chess opening" (8) is part of their play style, so maybe 1? 

Alternatively, "chess middlegame" (6) is a phase they play in, so 1. 

But according to the instructions, the scores should be based on how well they match the specific theme (the examples), not related aspects. Since the theme is people, only candidate 4 is a person who fits. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "chess professionals" which includes coaches and commentators, but the anti-examples exclude those roles. So the theme is "chess professionals who are players". Then a chess streamer could be a player, but unless specified, it's a role. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the user expects that some candidates are people but not top players, getting a low score. For example, "chess streamer" could be a player but not a World Champion, so maybe a 2. 

Alternatively, if the theme is "people associated with chess at a high level", then a coach or commentator might get a low score, but since they are anti-examples, the theme must exclude those roles. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "World Chess Champions" exactly, so only those who have held the title. Then Boris Gelfand (example) may not qualify (if only classical), but since he's listed as an example, we must assume he does. 

Thus, Kramnik is a 10. The rest are 0 except maybe someone else? 

Alternatively, maybe "Viswanathan Anand" is an example, so Indian players? But that's too specific. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "Grandmasters from different countries", but that's not clear. 

Given the strictest analysis, only candidate 4 is a direct match. The rest are 0. But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe I need to consider that some are closer. 

Wait, looking back, the anti-examples include "chess coach" and "commentator" which are roles related to chess but not players. The examples are all players. So the theme is "chess players at the highest level (Grandmasters or World Champions)". 

So candidates that are people who are chess players but not at that level would get lower scores. But among the candidates, only 4 is a top player. The rest are non-people or roles. 

Thus, all except 4 are 0. But since the user wants the full range, perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, candidate 2: "a chess streamer" could be a player, but the role itself isn't the player. Unless the streamer is a player, but the candidate is the role. So maybe 1? 

Alternatively, maybe "chess tournament" (3) is where they compete, so a 1. 

Alternatively, "chess puzzle" is used by them, so 1. 

But that's stretching. The user said the anti-examples are misleading but follow a broader theme. So the theme is specific to the examples. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with:

1. 0 (object)

2. 0 (role)

3. 0 (event)

4. 10 (fits exactly)

5. 0 (phase)

6. 0 (phase)

7. 0 (organization)

8. 0 (phase)

But the user wants the full range. Maybe I made a mistake and there are other candidates that are people. 

Wait, candidate 4 is a person. Are there any others? Let me check again:

Candidates:

1. a chess puzzle → object

2. a chess streamer → role

3. a chess tournament → event

4. Vladimir Kramnik → person

5. a chess endgame → phase

6. a chess middlegame → phase

7. a chess club → organization

8. a chess opening → phase

Thus, only 4 is a person who fits. The rest are 0. 

But the user specified to use the full range, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the theme is "chess players" in general, but the examples are top players. So a chess streamer (if they're a player) might be a 2. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "people involved in competitive chess", so a tournament organizer gets a low score. But tournament is an event. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "chess professionals" (excluding coaches and commentators), so a player would be high, but others like tournament director (but candidate is tournament event). 

Hmm. Since I have to assign scores using the full range, perhaps I should consider that some candidates are closer in other ways. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "people who have won major chess titles", so a tournament winner might get a score, but the candidate is the tournament itself. 

Alternatively, maybe "chess opening" is part of their expertise, so a 1? 

Alternatively, the problem might consider that the theme is "chess-related terms" but no, the examples are people. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "names associated with chess history" – but that's too broad. 

Alternatively, the theme could be "names of chess players who have held the number one ranking" – but I don't know their rankings. 

Alternatively, the theme could be "people who have played in the World Chess Championship" (as a participant). Boris Gelfand was a challenger, so if that's included, then maybe other candidates like a tournament director (but candidate 3 is the event). 

Alternatively, maybe "chess tournament" (3) is where these champions play, so a 1? 

Given the instructions to use the full range, I'll have to assign some scores between 0-10 even if it's a stretch. 

Re-evaluating with that in mind:

1. Chess puzzle: 0 (not a person, not related to being a champion)

2. Chess streamer: Maybe 1 (a role that could be performed by a top player, but the role itself isn't the player)

3. Chess tournament: 1 (events where champions compete, but not the people)

4. Vladimir Kramnik: 10

5. Chess endgame: 0 (phase of the game)

6. Chess middlegame: 0

7. Chess club: 1 (places where players gather, but not the players themselves)

8. Chess opening: 0 (phase)

Alternatively, maybe "chess club" (7) is where players meet, so 2. 

Alternatively, "chess streamer" (2) if they are a top player, but the candidate is the role, so maybe 2. 

Alternatively, "chess tournament" (3) could be a 2 because it's where champions compete. 

But this is speculative. Since the user wants nuanced scores, I'll assign:

1. 0

2. 1 (role, but could involve a player)

3. 1 (event where they compete)

4. 10

5. 0

6. 0

7. 1 (organization related to chess)

8. 0

Alternatively, maybe "chess opening" (8) is part of their expertise, so 1? 

Alternatively, "chess middlegame" (6) is a phase they play, so 1. 

But phases are concepts, so maybe 0. 

Alternatively, I'll give some low scores to the non-people entries that are directly related to chess, but not the theme:

Chess puzzle (1): 0

Chess streamer (2): 1

Chess tournament (3): 1

Chess endgame (5): 0

Chess middlegame (6): 0

Chess club (7): 1

Chess opening (8): 0

So scores would be:

1. 0

2. 1

3. 1

4. 10

5. 0

6. 0

7. 1

8. 0

But maybe tournament is a 2 because it's a major event. 

Alternatively, maybe "chess streamer" could be a 2 if they are a player, but the role itself isn't the player. 

Alternatively, I'm overcomplicating and should just give 0 except 4. But the user wants the full range. 

Alternatively, the theme might be "chess players" in general, so "chess streamer" (if a player) would be a 2, but since it's a role, maybe 1. 

I think I'll proceed with the above scores, even if they are low but using the full range.
