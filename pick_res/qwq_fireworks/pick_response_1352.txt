Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples (Romanesco broccoli, lightning protection systems on tall buildings, blood vessel networks in lungs) share, while the anti-examples (river deltas, snowflakes, mountain ranges) don't. 

Looking at the examples: Romanesco broccoli has a fractal structure, right? Its cones are made of smaller cones repeating the pattern. Lightning protection systems on tall buildings probably use a branching structure to conduct lightning to the ground efficiently. Blood vessel networks in lungs are also branching, fractal-like, ensuring efficient gas exchange. So maybe the theme is something like "fractal or branching structures that serve a functional purpose in distributing resources or managing energy efficiently."

Now the anti-examples: River deltas are branching, but maybe they're considered a broader category. Snowflakes have fractal patterns but might be more about crystallization. Mountain ranges are natural formations but not fractal in the same way. The key is that the specific theme is more about functional, biological or engineered systems with a branching/fractal structure for efficiency, not just any natural fractal or branching pattern.

Now the candidates:

1. Tree-like radio antennas: These are designed to receive signals across frequencies, using fractal-like branching. This seems to fit the specific theme (functional, engineered, fractal structure). Maybe a high score, like 8 or 9?

2. Spider webs: They have a radial structure but not exactly fractal. The design is optimized for catching prey, so functional. But is the structure strictly fractal? Maybe a 6 or 7.

3. Nautilus shells: Their spiral is logarithmic, which is a type of fractal? Or more of a simple spiral. Since the examples include Romanesco (fractal) and biological systems, maybe this is close but not exactly the same. Maybe a 5?

4. Spiral seashells: Similar to nautilus, but perhaps more clearly a spiral. Maybe same as above, 5?

5. Coral reefs: They have branching structures, but they're colonies. The anti-example includes river deltas which are branching but natural. Maybe it's too broad, so lower, like 4?

6. Leaf veins: Definitely a branching network for transporting nutrients, similar to blood vessels. This should be a strong match, maybe 9.

7. Pine trees: They have a conical shape with branches, but is it fractal? The branching is more hierarchical but maybe not strictly self-similar. Maybe 7?

8. Cloud formations: These can have fractal patterns, but they're not functional systems like the examples. So more like an anti-example, maybe 2 or 3.

Wait, but the anti-examples include snowflakes which are crystalline fractals. The theme is about functional systems (biological or engineered) with fractal/branching for efficiency. Clouds are natural but not functional in the same way. So cloud formations would be a 1 or 2.

Let me adjust:

1. Tree-like antennas: 8 (engineered fractal for function)
2. Spider webs: 6 (functional but not strictly fractal)
3. Nautilus: 5 (spiral but not branching)
4. Spiral shells: same as nautilus, 5
5. Coral: 4 (branching but collective, maybe too broad)
6. Leaf veins: 9 (excellent match)
7. Pine trees: 7 (branching but not as efficient system)
8. Clouds: 2 (fractal but not functional system)
