Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the given examples. The examples provided are:

- A gardener's flower arrangement code
- A sailor's love spoon with carved symbols
- A fan language system in Victorian society

Hmm, so each of these involves a form of communication or symbolism that's embedded within a cultural or occupational context. The flower arrangement code uses flowers to convey messages, the love spoons use carvings to symbolize feelings, and the fan language system uses gestures or items (like a fan's movements) to communicate secretly or within a specific social group. 

The anti-examples are:

- A microdot
- An invisible ink pen
- A coded message

These are more about covert communication methods. Microdots and invisible ink are physical means to hide messages, while a coded message is a direct substitution of words. The key difference here is that the examples are systems or methods that are part of a cultural practice or occupational tradition, using symbols inherent to their context, whereas the anti-examples are tools or methods for secret communication without that cultural/embedded aspect.

So the specific theme seems to be "systems of symbolic communication that are tied to a particular cultural practice, occupation, or historical context, using non-verbal or object-based symbols as part of their tradition."

Now, evaluating each candidate against this theme:

1. **A dead drop location**: Dead drops are about hiding physical items, not symbolic communication. It's a method of secret exchange, so more like the anti-examples (covert communication tools). But maybe it's part of a system? Not sure. Maybe a 3?

2. **A code book**: This is a tool for translating codes, more like the anti-examples (coded messages). It's a general code tool, not tied to a specific cultural practice. Probably low, like 2?

3. **A radio transmitter**: This is a communication device, not a symbolic system. It's a method of sending messages, not using symbols inherent to a culture. 1?

4. **A cipher wheel**: Similar to code book, a tool for encoding/decoding. Again, more about the method rather than cultural symbolism. Maybe 2?

5. **A treasure map**: A map is a direct representation, not symbolic in the same way. Unless the symbols on the map are part of a cultural system, but generally, treasure maps use standard symbols. Maybe 4?

6. **A decoder ring**: Like cipher wheel and code book, a tool for decoding messages. So similar to anti-examples, low score. Maybe 1?

7. **A carrier pigeon**: A method of message delivery, not a symbolic system. So 0?

8. **A quilt pattern used on the Underground Railroad**: This fits the theme! Quilt patterns were used symbolically as part of a historical/cultural context (Underground Railroad) to communicate. This is exactly like the examples given. So 10?

Wait, but the anti-examples are about being more general. Let me recheck. The quilt pattern is tied to a specific historical context (Underground Railroad) using quilt symbols, so yes, that's a perfect match. So 10.

Wait, the user said not to output the theme, just the scores. Let me go through each again carefully.

1. Dead drop location: It's a method for secret communication, not a symbolic system tied to a cultural practice. So low, maybe 2?

Wait, the examples are all symbolic systems within their own contexts. Dead drop is more about the method of exchange rather than a symbolic code. So 1 or 2.

2. Code book: Definitely a tool for codes, not tied to a cultural system. 1.

3. Radio transmitter: The device itself isn't symbolic, just a tool. 0?

4. Cipher wheel: Tool for encoding, so similar to anti-examples. 1.

5. Treasure map: If the symbols on the map are part of a specific system (like a pirate code?), but generally, treasure maps use standard symbols. Maybe 3? But maybe 4 if considering the map's use in a specific context like pirate tradition.

6. Decoder ring: Same as cipher wheel, 1.

7. Carrier pigeon: Just a method, 0.

8. Quilt pattern: 10.

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Let me adjust:

1. Dead drop: Maybe 3. It's part of a communication system but not symbolic in the same way as the examples. The examples use symbols inherent to their practice (flowers, spoons, fans), while dead drop is a location method. So maybe 3.

2. Code book: 2.

3. Radio: 1.

4. Cipher wheel: 2.

5. Treasure map: 3 (if the map's symbols are part of a tradition, like pirate lore, but not sure. Maybe 2?)

6. Decoder ring: 1.

7. Carrier pigeon: 0.

8. Quilt: 10.

Alternatively, maybe the treasure map isn't symbolic but literal. So lower. Maybe 2.

But I need to ensure the scores are nuanced. Let me think again.

The key is that the examples are symbolic systems tied to their cultural/occupational context. So:

- Quilt patterns (8): 10.

- Dead drop (1): 2 (since it's part of espionage, but not a symbolic system itself).

- Code book (2): 1 (tool for codes).

- Radio (3): 0 (device, no symbolism).

- Cipher (4): 1.

- Treasure map (5): 2 (if the map's symbols are part of a system, like pirate symbols, but that's a stretch. Maybe 1? Hmm.

- Decoder ring (6): 1.

- Carrier pigeon (7): 0.

Alternatively, maybe the treasure map is a 3? Because maybe the symbols on the map (like X marks the spot) are part of a symbolic system, but that's very basic and not tied to a cultural practice beyond general treasure hunting. So maybe 2.

I think I'll go with:

1. 3

2. 2

3. 1

4. 2

5. 2

6. 1

7. 0

8. 10

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be as per the examples. Let me check each candidate again:

1. Dead drop location: It's a method for exchanging items secretly. Not a symbolic system. So maybe 1.

2. Code book: A tool for codes. 1.

3. Radio transmitter: The device itself isn't symbolic. 0.

4. Cipher wheel: Tool for codes. 1.

5. Treasure map: If the map uses symbols (like a specific code for landmarks), but it's more literal. Maybe 2.

6. Decoder ring: 1.

7. Carrier pigeon: 0.

8. Quilt pattern: 10.

Alternatively, maybe the dead drop is part of a larger system (like spies using specific locations as symbols), but that's stretching. So maybe 2.

I think I'll adjust:

1. 2

2. 1

3. 0

4. 1

5. 2

6. 1

7. 0

8. 10

But need to ensure all scores are spread out. Maybe the treasure map is 3 if considering the map's symbols as a system. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the carrier pigeon is a method of transmission, not symbolic, so 0. Dead drop is a method of exchange, so 1.

Final scores:

1. Dead drop: 2

2. Code book: 1

3. Radio: 0

4. Cipher:1

5. Treasure map: 3 (if symbols are part of the map's design in a tradition)

6. Decoder ring:1

7. Carrier pigeon:0

8. Quilt:10

This uses 0,1,2,3,10. Maybe that's okay. Let me see:

Alternatively, maybe the carrier pigeon is part of a system (like homing pigeons used in wars with coded messages), but the pigeon itself is the method, not the symbolic system. So still 0.

Alright, proceeding with these scores.
