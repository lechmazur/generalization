Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given: Abacus, Slide rule, and Napier's bones. All three are historical calculating tools. They are all physical devices used for mathematical computations before electronic calculators. The key here is that they are analog or mechanical aids for arithmetic, designed to assist in calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Now, the anti-examples are Logarithm table, Trigonometry table, and Adding machine. The first two are tables of numbers used for computations, which are more about reference than physical computation devices. The Adding machine is a bit trickier because it is a mechanical device, but maybe it's considered part of a broader category like early office calculators, which might be more general than the specific theme of the examples. The examples are all manual, non-electric, and perhaps more "old-school" pre-20th-century tools.

So the specific theme is likely "manual, non-electronic calculating devices used for arithmetic operations." Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this theme, while excluding broader categories that might include the anti-examples.

Looking at the candidates:

1. **Statistical software**: This is electronic and software-based, so it's definitely outside the manual/non-electronic theme. But maybe it's related to computation. However, since the examples are physical tools, this would be a 0 or low score.

2. **Mechanical calculator**: This is a mechanical device for calculations. It's similar to the examples but might be more advanced. Slide rules and abaci are simpler, while mechanical calculators can perform more complex operations. But since they are mechanical and non-electronic, maybe a high score like 8 or 9? Wait, but the anti-example includes Adding machine, which might be a type of mechanical calculator. Hmm, need to be careful here. The Adding machine is an anti-example, so maybe mechanical calculators in general are too close to that? Or perhaps the Adding machine is a subset. The original examples are more about manual computation aids without being programmable. So mechanical calculators like the ones from the 19th/20th century (like the Curta) might fit better. Maybe a 7 or 8?

3. **Smartphone**: Definitely electronic and modern. Not manual, so 0 or low. Unless considering apps that mimic old tools, but the device itself isn't the theme. Probably 0-2.

4. **Quantum computer**: Way too advanced and electronic, unrelated. 0.

5. **Computer**: General-purpose electronic device. Not manual. 0.

6. **Spreadsheet software**: Again, electronic software. 0-2.

7. **Graphing paper**: Like graph paper or grid paper. It's a tool for plotting graphs or doing math visually, but not a calculating device. It aids in visualization rather than computation. Maybe a 3? Because it's a tool for math but not directly for computation like the examples.

8. **Cash register**: Mechanical cash registers (older ones) might have been mechanical, but many are electronic now. The original examples are purely computation tools, while cash registers are for business transactions. However, early mechanical cash registers did have adding mechanisms. But since the anti-example includes Adding machine, which might be similar, maybe cash registers are in the broader category. So maybe a 4 or 5? But if the Adding machine is an anti-example, perhaps cash register is too close to that, so lower. Hmm.

Wait, let me re-examine the anti-examples. The Adding machine is an anti-example, so the specific theme excludes devices that are more specialized for business or adding only? Or perhaps the Adding machine is considered part of a broader category like "mechanical calculators for business" whereas the examples are general computation tools. The abacus and slide rule are more general-purpose, while the adding machine is specialized. So maybe mechanical calculator (candidate 2) is more general and fits the theme, but cash register is more specialized, hence lower.

So scoring:

1. Statistical software: 0 (electronic, software)
2. Mechanical calculator: 8 (mechanical, general computation, similar to examples but maybe more advanced than abacus/slide rule)
3. Smartphone: 0 (electronic)
4. Quantum computer: 0
5. Computer: 0
6. Spreadsheet software: 0
7. Graphing paper: 3 (tool for math but not computational)
8. Cash register: 4 (mechanical but specialized, closer to anti-example adding machine)

Wait, but the slide rule and abacus are also general-purpose, so maybe mechanical calculator (2) is a strong match. The Adding machine is an anti-example, so cash register might be similar. Let me think again.

Abacus, Slide rule, Napier's Bones are all handheld or small devices for arithmetic. The anti-examples are tables (log, trigonometric) which are references, and adding machine which is a specific tool for business adding.

So mechanical calculator (2) is a device that can perform various arithmetic operations mechanically, like an abacus but more advanced. So maybe 9? But perhaps the original examples are pre-calculator era. The slide rule is from the 17th century, abacus even older. Mechanical calculators became prominent in the 19th-20th century. So maybe they are part of the same theme. So 9?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "non-electronic analog computation devices". Then mechanical calculators would fit, so 9.

Cash register, even if mechanical, is a specialized device for business, so maybe 3 or 4.

Graphing paper is just paper, so maybe 2?

Wait, let's go step by step:

For each candidate:

1. Statistical software: 0 (electronic, software, not physical)

2. Mechanical calculator: 9 (mechanical, computational, fits the theme of manual computation devices)

3. Smartphone: 0 (electronic, not manual)

4. Quantum computer: 0 (electronic, advanced)

5. Computer: 0 (electronic general purpose)

6. Spreadsheet software: 0 (same as 1)

7. Graphing paper: Maybe 2? Because it's a tool for math but not computational like the examples. The examples are tools that help compute, whereas graph paper is for plotting or organizing calculations, not performing them.

8. Cash register: 3 or 4. If a mechanical cash register is a type of adding machine, which is an anti-example, then it would be lower. But if cash registers are considered separate but still mechanical, maybe 4? Since adding machine is an anti-example, cash register might be similar, so lower than mechanical calculator but higher than graph paper. Maybe 4.

Wait, but the anti-examples include Adding machine, so cash register (if it's similar to adding machine) would be an anti-example. But cash register is a candidate here, so it should get a lower score. Since the user said anti-examples are not to be included. So cash register would be similar to adding machine (anti-example), so maybe 1 or 2? Hmm, but cash register might have more functions. Maybe 3?

Alternatively, perhaps cash registers are a type of adding machine, so they would be 0. But the anti-example is adding machine, so cash register might be a 1?

Alternatively, maybe cash registers are a form of mechanical calculator but specialized, so maybe 5?

This is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again.

The key is that the anti-examples are things that follow a broader theme but not the specific one. The specific theme is manual computation devices. Adding machine is an anti-example, so even though it's a mechanical device for computation, it's too specialized (for adding in business) so it's excluded. So cash register, which is similar in purpose to adding machine (business use), would also be excluded, hence lower score.

Mechanical calculator (2) is a general-purpose device, so higher score.

Graphing paper is a tool for math but not computational, so low.

So:

1. 0

2. 9

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 2

8. 2 or 3. Since cash register is a business tool like adding machine (anti-example), maybe 2.

Alternatively, graphing paper is 3, cash register 2.

Hmm. Maybe:

7. Graphing paper: 3 (it's a tool for math, but not computational like the examples)

8. Cash register: 2 (similar to anti-example, so lower)

Alternatively, since cash register might have mechanical components for addition, maybe 4?

Alternatively, maybe the cash register's mechanical parts are part of the theme, but its primary function is business, so it's in the broader category. Hence, 3.

I think I'll go with:

1. 0

2. 9

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 3

8. 3

Wait but need to make sure the scores are spread out. Let me check again.

Wait, the user said to use the full range from 0 to 10. So I should have some variation. Let me see:

Mechanical calculator is 9, that's high. Then maybe:

Graphing paper: 2 (since it's a tool but not computational)

Cash register: 3 (a bit more related than graph paper but still specialized)

Wait, but maybe cash register is closer to adding machine (anti-example), so 2, and graphing paper is 1?

Alternatively, maybe mechanical calculator is 8 instead of 9. Let me see:

The examples are all pre-mechanical calculator? Or are mechanical calculators part of the same category? Slide rule and abacus are analog, mechanical calculator is a step up but still mechanical. So 9 is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "tools that physically represent numbers for manipulation", so abacus beads, slide rule scales, Napier's bones rods. Mechanical calculators use gears and levers, so maybe they are a bit different. So perhaps 7?

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think of the exact examples:

Abacus: beads on rods, manually moved.

Slide rule: sliding scales for multiplication/division.

Napier's bones: rods with multiplication tables for manual calculation.

All are physical manipulation of components to perform arithmetic.

Mechanical calculator would use gears and wheels to compute, so it's a different mechanism but still a mechanical device for computation. So maybe it's a 8 or 9.

Cash register: if mechanical, it has mechanisms for adding totals, so similar to adding machine (anti-example). Since adding machine is excluded, cash register would be 2 or 3.

Graphing paper: just paper, so maybe 1 or 2.

So maybe:

2. Mechanical calculator: 8 (since it's a step beyond the examples but still mechanical computation)

Then:

1. 0

2. 8

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 2

8. 2

But need to spread the scores. Maybe:

Graphing paper: 3 (since it's used in math context)

Cash register: 2 (closer to anti-example)

Mechanical calculator: 9

Alternatively, I'll go with:

<number>1</number><score>0</score>

<number>2</number><score>9</score>

<number>3</number><score>0</score>

<number>4</number><score>0</score>

<number>5</number><score>0</score>

<number>6</number><score>0</score>

<number>7</number><score>3</score>

<number>8</number><score>2</score>

This uses 0,2,3,9 which covers more of the range. Alternatively, maybe cash register is 4, but I'll proceed with this.
