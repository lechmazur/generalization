Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given: Heat sealer, Hot glue gun, and Plastic welding gun. All three of these tools use heat to apply or melt a material to seal or join items, particularly plastics. The key elements here are the application of heat and the use of a malleable substance (like glue or plastic) to bond materials.

Now, looking at the anti-examples: Welding torch, Stapler, Rivet gun. These don't fit the exact theme. A welding torch uses heat but is for metal, not plastic. A stapler and rivet gun use mechanical fasteners without heat. So the theme isn't just "bonding tools" but specifically those that use heat to melt or activate a bonding agent, likely for plastics.

Next, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Pressure-sensitive adhesive**: This is like tape or stickers that stick without heat. Doesn't use heat, so probably a low score. Maybe 2 or 3.

2. **Super glue**: Chemical adhesive, no heat involved. But it's a strong glue. Since the examples use heat, this is a no. Maybe 1 or 2.

3. **Epoxy resin**: Again, a chemical adhesive, cured sometimes with heat but often at room temperature. If it's heat-cured, maybe higher, but generally not relying on heat application like the examples. Maybe 3.

4. **Soldering iron**: Uses heat to melt solder for joining metals. The examples are for plastics, but this is similar in using heat to melt a bonding material. However, the anti-example includes welding torch (metal), so maybe this is too close to the broader theme. Hmm, tricky. Maybe 7? Since it uses heat but on metal, but the mechanism is similar.

5. **Wood glue**: Usually applied without heat, though sometimes heat can help. But primary use is room temp. So maybe 4.

6. **Nail gun**: Mechanical, no heat. Anti-example has rivet gun and stapler, so definitely low. 0 or 1.

7. **Mechanical fastener**: General term, includes nails, screws. No heat. So 0.

8. **Seamless tape**: Like duct tape, pressure-sensitive. No heat. Maybe 1 or 2.

Wait, need to ensure the scores are spread out. Let me reassess:

- The examples all involve heat application to melt a bonding agent (glue, plastic). So the key is heat + bonding via melting.

Soldering iron (4) does use heat to melt solder (metal), so maybe it's a closer match than epoxy or super glue. Maybe 7.

Pressure-sensitive (1) and seamless tape (8) are both 0-2.

Wood glue (5): If sometimes uses heat, but not primarily. Maybe 3.

Epoxy (3) might be 2 or 3. Super glue (2) is 1.

Nail gun (6) is 0, mechanical fastener (7) 0.

So adjusting:

1. Pressure-sensitive: 1

2. Super glue: 1

3. Epoxy: 2

4. Soldering iron: 7

5. Wood glue: 3

6. Nail gun: 0

7. Mechanical fastener: 0

8. Seamless tape: 1

Wait, but need to make sure the scores are nuanced and use the full range. Maybe Soldering iron is 6 instead of 7? Since it's on metal, but method is similar. Let's see:

Alternatively, Heat sealer, hot glue gun, plastic welding gun all use heat to melt the material being joined (plastic or glue). Soldering iron melts solder (a different material) to join metals. So it's similar in using heat to melt a bonding agent, but the application is different. Maybe 6 or 7.

Epoxy could be 3 if sometimes heat is used, but generally not. Maybe 3.

Wood glue: 2.

Pressure-sensitive: 1

Seamless tape: 1

Nail gun and mechanical: 0

Super glue: 1

So final scores:

1. 1

2. 1

3. 3

4. 6

5. 2

6. 0

7. 0

8. 1

But need to check if I missed anything. Let me list again:

1. Pressure-sensitive adhesive: No heat. 1.

2. Super glue: Chemical, no heat. 1.

3. Epoxy: Sometimes heat can cure, but not the primary method. Maybe 2 or 3. Let's say 2.

4. Soldering iron: Uses heat to melt solder. Matches the heat aspect but for metal. Maybe 6.

5. Wood glue: Usually no heat. 2.

6. Nail gun: 0.

7. Mechanical: 0.

8. Seamless tape: 1.

Hmm, perhaps 4 gets 7 because it's closer in method even if material differs. The anti-example is welding torch (for metal), but the theme's examples are for plastic. So maybe soldering iron is a better match than epoxy, but not as good as the examples. So 6 or 7.

Alternatively, maybe 5 for soldering iron.

This is a bit subjective, but I'll go with:

1. 1

2. 1

3. 2

4. 6

5. 2

6. 0

7. 0

8. 1
