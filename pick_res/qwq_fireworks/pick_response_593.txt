Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples (gyroscope, hoverboard, self-balancing robot) share, while the anti-examples (unicycle, tightrope, skateboard) don't. 

Looking at the examples: a gyroscope uses angular momentum to maintain orientation, hoverboards (like the self-balancing scooters) use sensors and motors to stay upright, and self-balancing robots, like the Segway or some robotic platforms, also rely on similar technology. The common thread here seems to be **active stabilization through technology or mechanisms that counteract forces to maintain balance without external support**. They don't just rely on the user's balance but have internal systems to stay balanced.

Now the anti-examples: a unicycle requires the rider to balance it, a tightrope walker uses their own balance, and a skateboard also depends on the rider's skill. These don't have built-in mechanisms for self-balancing; they rely on the user. So the key difference is whether the object itself has a system to maintain balance autonomously.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. **Helicopter**: Helicopters use gyroscopic effects and control systems to stay stable in the air. They have active stabilization mechanisms. This seems like a strong match. But wait, a helicopter's primary function is flight, not just balancing. However, the stabilization systems are crucial. Maybe a 7 or 8?

2. **Bicycle**: Bicycles rely on the rider's balance and the gyroscopic effect of the wheels, but they don't have active self-balancing systems like a Segway. So it's more like the anti-examples. Maybe a 3 or 4?

3. **Spinning top**: A spinning top uses gyroscopic force to stay upright. That's similar to a gyroscope. This should be a high score, maybe 9 or 10? But wait, the examples are all man-made devices with intentional balancing mechanisms. A spinning top is a toy but still uses the same principle. Maybe 8?

4. **Seesaw**: A seesaw balances due to a pivot point and equal weights, but it doesn't have an active system. It's passive. So probably a low score, like 2?

5. **Pogo stick**: It uses spring and requires the user to bounce and balance. No active stabilization. So similar to the anti-examples. Maybe 1 or 2?

6. **Segway**: Definitely a self-balancing robot. The original examples include a Segway-like robot. This is a 10.

7. **Drone**: Drones use sensors and motors to maintain position and balance in the air. They have active stabilization. Similar to hoverboards and gyroscopes. Probably a 9?

8. **Balance beam**: A gymnastics balance beam is just a beam; the performer uses their own balance. No active system. So 0 or 1. Maybe 1 because it's about balance but not self-stabilizing.

Wait, let me check again. The examples are all objects that can maintain balance autonomously. The anti-examples require human input. So:

- Helicopter (active stabilization) → 8
- Bicycle (passive gyroscopic effect, needs rider) → 3
- Spinning top (gyroscopic, but not a device with active systems beyond spinning) → Maybe 7? Because it's a gyroscope-like effect but not a mechanical system with sensors.
- Seesaw (passive) → 1
- Pogo stick (user-dependent) → 2
- Segway (10)
- Drone (active stabilization) → 9
- Balance beam (0)

Hmm, maybe adjust the spinning top to 7, helicopter 8, drone 9. That uses the scale more. Let me structure the scores accordingly.

<number>1</number><score>8</score>
<number>2</number><score>3</score>
<number>3</number><score>7</score>
<number>4</number><score>1</score>
<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>10</score>
<number>7</number><score>9</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
