Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the given examples: lens, prism, rainbow. Let me think about what these have in common.

A lens bends light to focus it, a prism splits white light into colors, and a rainbow is formed when sunlight is refracted and dispersed by water droplets. So they all involve the dispersion or bending of light into its component colors. The common theme here seems to be the interaction of light with materials or natural phenomena that result in the separation or manipulation of light's spectrum.

Now the anti-examples are telescope, microscope, and sound wave. Telescopes and microscopes use lenses or mirrors to magnify images, which is related to light but not specifically about splitting light into colors. Sound waves are unrelated since they're about sound, not light. So the specific theme is more about light dispersion or spectral effects rather than general optics or waves.

Now evaluating each candidate:

1. **Pendulum**: A pendulum is about periodic motion, like in clocks. Doesn't relate to light dispersion. So probably a 0 or 1. But maybe 1 if considering gravity's role, but no, the theme is light.

2. **Aurora borealis**: Northern lights are caused by charged particles interacting with the atmosphere, emitting light. The colors are due to different gases, but it's a natural light phenomenon. However, is it about dispersion like a prism? Maybe a 3? Not exactly splitting white light but producing colors through other means.

3. **Solar panel**: Converts sunlight into electricity. Involves light but not dispersion. So maybe 1 or 2. Not about separating colors.

4. **Gravity**: A fundamental force. Doesn't directly relate to light dispersion. 0.

5. **Electric circuit**: Deals with electricity flow, not light. 0.

6. **Magnet**: Magnetic fields, unrelated to light's spectrum. 0.

7. **Black hole**: Relates to gravity and space, not light dispersion. Unless considering light bending around it (gravitational lensing), but that's a stretch. Maybe a 2? But the original theme is more about color dispersion. So probably 1 or 0.

8. **Diffraction grating**: This splits light into spectra, similar to a prism. So this should be a 10. Wait, but the examples include prism and rainbow, so diffraction grating is a direct match. But let me check the anti-examples. The anti-examples include telescope and microscope, which are optical but not about dispersion. So diffraction grating is a perfect fit. So 10?

Wait the problem says anti-examples do not match the specific theme but fit a broader one. The diffraction grating is definitely in the specific theme. So why is the user's example including prism and lens, which are also optical but part of the specific theme. So yes, diffraction grating should be a 10. But the user's instructions say to not output the theme, just the scores. Wait but let me check the candidates again.

Wait the user's candidates include diffraction grating as 8. So 8 would be a 10. Let me recheck each:

1. Pendulum: 0
2. Aurora: Maybe 3, since it produces colors but not via dispersion.
3. Solar panel: 1
4. Gravity: 0
5. Electric: 0
6. Magnet: 0
7. Black hole: Maybe 1 if considering gravitational lensing bends light but not dispersing colors. But lensing can cause multiple images but not rainbow effect. So 1?
8. Diffraction grating: 10

Wait but the user's examples are lens (which focuses light), prism (disperses), rainbow (dispersed light). So diffraction grating is exactly like prism, so 10. 

But let me see if any of the others might have a better score. Aurora might get a higher score. Aurora's colors are from different gases emitting light at certain wavelengths, not dispersion. So maybe 2? 

So final scores:

1. 0
2. 2
3. 1
4. 0
5. 0
6. 0
7. 1
8. 10

Wait but the user wants scores from 0-10, nuanced. Let me see again:

Aurora borealis: The colors are due to ionization, not dispersion of white light. So maybe 1. 

Solar panel: 1 because it's about light but not dispersion. 

Black hole: 1 because gravitational lensing bends light but not dispersing into spectrum. 

Pendulum: 0. 

Magnet, gravity, electric circuit: 0. 

So maybe:

1. 0

2. 1

3. 1

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 1

8. 10

But perhaps aurora can get a 3? Because it does produce a spectrum of colors, even if not via dispersion. The rainbow is a natural dispersion, so aurora's colors are different but still colored light phenomena. Hmm, maybe 3. 

Alternatively, the theme is specifically about dispersion of white light into spectrum. So aurora's colors are not from white light being split, so lower. Maybe 2?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "phenomena involving light's spectrum", then aurora would be a 5? But the examples are all about splitting white light. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The examples are lens (which can focus but also can disperse if not achromatic), prism (definitely splits light), and rainbow (natural prism effect). So the key is splitting white light into colors. 

Aurora's colors are emitted by different gases at specific wavelengths, so it's not splitting white light but emitting specific colors. So it's not part of the theme. So maybe 1.

Diffraction grating is exactly the same as prism, so 10.

Black hole's gravitational lensing bends light paths but doesn't split into colors, so 0 or 1. Maybe 1 because it's related to light's path, but not the spectrum. 

Solar panel: 0 or 1. Since it uses light energy but not spectrum splitting. 

Pendulum: 0. 

Magnet, gravity, electric: 0. 

So the scores would be:

1. 0

2. 1

3. 1

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 1

8.10

Wait but the user wants to use the full range, so maybe some in between. Let me see if any candidate can get higher.

What about magnet? No. Electric circuit? No. 

Aurora: maybe 2. 

Black hole: 1. 

Solar panel: 1.

Pendulum: 0. 

So the scores:

1.0

2.2

3.1

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.1

8.10

Alternatively, maybe aurora's colors are more related, so 3. 

Alternatively, maybe diffraction grating is 10, and others are 0-2 except aurora maybe 3. 

Alternatively, the aurora is a natural phenomenon with colors, but not due to dispersion, so perhaps 2. 

I think that's the way to go. So final scores as per the format.
