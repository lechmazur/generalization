Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided examples and anti-examples to define a specific theme. The examples are all about simulating historical tools or methods used by ancient civilizations for navigation or agriculture based on celestial observations. The anti-examples are modern tech that uses current data or general sky displays without the historical method replication.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. A program simulating star/planet movements for education. Hmm, the examples are about specific historical tools (astrolabe, Maya methods, Polynesian star patterns). This candidate is general education, not tied to a specific ancient method. So maybe a 3? It's similar in simulation but lacks the cultural/historical method aspect.

2. VR recreating ancient Egyptian priests' night sky for astrology. This directly references a specific ancient culture's use (Egyptian priests) and their astrological purposes. That's very much in line with the examples, so probably a high score like 8 or 9. Wait, the examples are about navigation and agriculture. But the theme is about replicating methods used by ancient civilizations for their specific purposes. Since astrology is a form of celestial use by a culture, this fits well. Maybe 9?

3. Smartphone app with real-time satellite imagery. The anti-examples include modern navigation using satellites. This is real-time and satellite-based, so it's an anti-example. Definitely a 0 or 1. Since the anti-examples are 0, this would be 0.

4. Modern GPS in cars. Directly an anti-example (modern ships using satellites). So 0.

5. Digital tool mapping constellations worldwide. The examples involve specific cultural methods. Mapping constellations is general and not tied to a historical navigation/agriculture method. Maybe a 2? It's related to stars but not the specific application.

6. Program calculating planet positions for research. The examples are about mimicking historical methods, not scientific research. So this is more modern astronomy. Maybe a 1 or 2. Since it's calculation without cultural context, 2?

7. VR exploring the solar system. This is a general educational tool, not tied to a historical navigation method. Maybe 1? But the examples use simulations. Wait, the first example is an astrolabe simulation. But this is broader. So maybe 3? Hmm, but the theme requires replicating ancient methods. Exploring the solar system isn't about replicating a specific historical tool or method. So maybe 2?

8. Digital tool tracking moon phases for planning. The Maya example used celestial observations for agriculture. This is tracking moon phases, which could be for planning, similar to the Maya's agricultural cycles. But is it tied to a specific ancient culture's method? The candidate doesn't mention a culture, just general planning. So maybe a 4? It's closer but lacks the cultural specificity.

Wait, let me recheck. The theme requires the replication of methods used by specific ancient civilizations. The examples all name a culture (Greek, Maya, Polynesian) and their specific application (navigation, agriculture cycles, wayfinding). 

Candidate 2 mentions ancient Egyptian priests and their astrological purposes, which fits the cultural specificity. So that's a strong 9. 

Candidate 8 is about moon phases for planning but not tied to a specific culture's method. So maybe 3 or 4. 

Candidate 5 is mapping constellations, which is a general tool, not tied to a culture's method. 2.

Candidate 1 is a general simulation program, so 3.

Candidate 6's planet positions for research: 1.

Candidate 7's solar system exploration: 1 or 2. Since it's VR but not a historical tool, maybe 2.

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 9

3. 0

4. 0

5. 2

6. 1

7. 2

8. 4

Wait, but let me check again. The user said anti-examples are virtual planetariums (like candidate 1?), but the first example is an astrolabe simulator. So candidate 1 is a general simulation, not tied to a specific ancient method. So maybe lower than 3? Maybe 2? Hmm, the first example is an app that simulates the astrolabe. So if a candidate is simulating a specific historical tool (like the astrolabe), that's a 10. But candidate 1 is a general program for star movement. So not specific to a tool used by a culture. So perhaps 3 is okay.

Candidate 8's moon phase tracking: The Maya example is about agricultural cycles based on celestial observations. Tracking moon phases for planning could be similar, but unless it's tied to a specific culture's method, it's less. So 4 is okay. Maybe 3?

Alternatively, if the Maya used moon phases, but the candidate isn't specifying a culture, so it's broader. So 3.

I think my initial scores are okay. Let me proceed with that.
