Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the given examples: truncated cube, truncated icosahedron, truncated octahedron. These are all truncated Archimedean solids. Wait, actually, truncation in polyhedrons usually refers to cutting off the corners to a certain depth. The key here is that the examples are all truncated regular polyhedrons (cube, icosahedron, octahedron) resulting in Archimedean solids with regular faces. 

Now, the anti-examples are things like truncated dodecahedron with unequal edge lengths, truncated tetrahedron with irregular hexagons, and another truncated dodecahedron with irregular faces. These are variations where the truncation isn't done in a way that preserves regular faces. So the specific theme must be Archimedean truncated solids where all faces are regular polygons. The anti-examples break that by having irregular faces or unequal edges.

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Cuboctahedron: This is an Archimedean solid but it's not a truncation of a Platonic solid in the same way. It's a rectified cube or octahedron, so maybe a 0 or low score because it's not a truncation but a rectification.

2. Rhombicuboctahedron: This is an expanded cube or octahedron, another Archimedean solid but again not a simple truncation. So maybe lower score.

3. Augmented truncated cube: The term "augmented" suggests adding a part, so it's modified beyond the standard truncation. Probably lower score, maybe 2 or 3.

4. Great rhombicosidodecahedron: That's a truncated icosidodecahedron? Wait, no, the great rhombicosidodecahedron is a truncated form but more extensive, maybe a great truncation. It's an Archimedean solid but perhaps not a simple truncation of a single Platonic solid. So maybe a 5 or 6?

5. Truncated tetrahedron: Wait, the examples included truncated cube, icosahedron, octahedron. Truncated tetrahedron is also a standard Archimedean truncated Platonic solid. But wait, the anti-example includes a truncated tetrahedron with irregular hexagons, which is not regular. So the standard truncated tetrahedron (with regular faces) should be a perfect match. So maybe 10?

Wait, but the user's examples didn't include truncated tetrahedron. Wait the examples are truncated cube, truncated icosahedron, truncated octahedron. The truncated tetrahedron is another Platonic solid's truncation, so maybe it's part of the theme. So perhaps 10?

But the anti-examples include a truncated tetrahedron with irregular hexagons, so the regular one would be a good example. So 10?

6. Partially truncated icosahedron: The examples are fully truncated versions. "Partially" suggests it's not fully truncated, so edges might not be regular. So maybe 2 or 3.

7. Snub cube: That's a different Archimedean solid, not a truncation. So low score, maybe 0 or 1.

8. Great truncated cuboctahedron: This is a non-convex Archimedean? Or maybe a great rhombicuboctahedron? Wait, the great truncated cuboctahedron is a uniform star polyhedron, which might have intersecting faces. Since the examples are convex Archimedean, this might not fit, so low score like 2.

Wait, let me check each candidate again carefully:

1. Cuboctahedron: Formed by truncating a cube or octahedron to the midpoints, but it's a rectification, not a truncation. So not part of the theme. So 0 or 1.

2. Rhombicuboctahedron: Truncated to a higher degree, but actually it's an expansion. Not a simple truncation. Maybe 2.

3. Augmented truncated cube: "Augmented" implies adding pyramids or something, so it's modified beyond truncation. 2.

4. Great rhombicosidodecahedron: Also known as the truncated icosidodecahedron. Wait, actually, the great rhombicosidodecahedron is a convex Archimedean solid, which is a truncation of the icosidodecahedron. Hmm, but maybe it's considered a truncation of the dodecahedron or icosahedron. Wait, actually, the standard truncation of a dodecahedron is the truncated dodecahedron, but the great rhombicosidodecahedron is a more extensive truncation (rectified then truncated?), so maybe it's part of the broader theme but not the specific. Since the anti-examples included a truncated dodecahedron with unequal edges, but the great one might have regular faces. Wait, the great rhombicosidodecahedron has all regular faces (squares, hexagons, decagons?), so maybe it's a 10? Wait no, the original examples are truncations of the cube, icosahedron, octahedron. The great rhombicosidodecahedron is a truncation of the dodecahedron or icosahedron? Wait, actually, the great rhombicosidodecahedron is formed by truncating the icosidodecahedron. Hmm, perhaps it's part of a different category. Since the examples are truncations of the original Platonic solids (cube, octa, ico), but the great rhombicosidodecahedron is a truncation of a different Archimedean, so maybe it's a 5?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is specifically the Archimedean solids that are truncations of the Platonic solids (cube, octa, tetra, dodeca, ico). The examples include cube, octa, ico truncations. So truncated tetrahedron (candidate 5) would be included. The truncated dodecahedron would be part of the theme, but the anti-example is a truncated dodecahedron with irregular faces. So the regular truncated dodecahedron would be part of the theme, but it's not in the examples. But the question says the examples are three examples of the theme, so the theme includes all truncations of the five Platonic solids (except maybe the tetrahedron's truncation? Wait, truncated tetrahedron exists. So the theme is "truncated Platonic solids resulting in Archimedean solids with all regular faces". So candidate 5 (truncated tetrahedron) is a 10. The truncated dodecahedron (if regular) would also be a 10, but since it's not listed as an example but an anti-example when modified, so the candidate with the regular one is acceptable.

Now, the great rhombicosidodecahedron (candidate 4) is a truncated icosidodecahedron, which is an Archimedean solid but not a truncation of a Platonic solid. So it would be part of a broader category, so score lower. Maybe 5 or 6.

Candidate 4: great rhombicosidodecahedron: maybe 6?

Candidate 5: truncated tetrahedron: 10.

Candidate 6: partially truncated icosahedron: since it's not fully truncated, faces might not be regular. So score low, like 2.

Candidate 7: snub cube: Not a truncation. 0.

Candidate 8: great truncated cuboctahedron: This is a non-convex uniform polyhedron (a great rhombicuboctahedron?), so not part of the theme. 1 or 2.

Wait, need to confirm:

Great truncated cuboctahedron is also called the truncated cuboctahedron but great? Wait, maybe it's a star polyhedron. The standard truncated cuboctahedron (which is convex) is the great rhombicuboctahedron. Wait, the great truncated cuboctahedron is a non-convex one, so it has intersecting faces and might not have regular faces? Or does it? Hmm, perhaps it's a different category. Since the theme requires regular faces and convexity, this would be a 0 or 1.

Now, let me assign scores:

1. Cuboctahedron: 0 (not a truncation but rectification)

2. Rhombicuboctahedron: 3 (it's an expansion, not a simple truncation)

3. Augmented truncated cube: 2 (modified beyond truncation)

4. Great rhombicosidodecahedron: 6 (a more complex truncation but maybe part of a broader category)

5. Truncated tetrahedron: 10 (exactly fits the theme)

6. Partially truncated icosahedron: 1 (incomplete truncation leads to irregular faces)

7. Snub cube: 0 (not a truncation)

8. Great truncated cuboctahedron: 1 (non-convex and not a standard truncation)

Wait, but the great rhombicosidodecahedron is actually an Archimedean solid which is a truncation of the icosidodecahedron, but perhaps considered a truncation in a different way. Alternatively, maybe it's a truncation of the dodecahedron or icosahedron beyond the standard truncation. Since the theme is truncations of the original Platonic solids, the great rhombicosidodecahedron might not qualify, so maybe a 4?

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The examples are the three truncations of cube, octa, icosahedron. The theme is "truncated Platonic solids (resulting in Archimedean solids with regular faces)". So the truncated tetrahedron (candidate 5) is a fourth example, so it should get 10. The truncated dodecahedron would also be a 10 if regular, but the anti-example has it with irregular faces. So candidate 5 is a perfect 10.

The great rhombicosidodecahedron is a truncated icosidodecahedron (which is an Archimedean itself), so it's a truncation of another Archimedean, not a Platonic. Hence, not part of the specific theme, so maybe a 5? Or lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is just the set of those three given examples. But that seems too narrow. The problem states "specific theme, rule, category, or criterion". The examples are three different truncations of the cube, octa, icosahedron. The anti-examples are variations of the dodecahedron and tetrahedron truncations but with irregularities. So the theme is "truncated regular (Platonic) solids with all faces regular (i.e., Archimedean truncated solids)". So any truncated Platonic solid that is an Archimedean solid would qualify. Thus:

- Truncated tetrahedron (candidate 5): yes, so 10.

- Truncated dodecahedron (if it were a candidate, it would be 10, but not listed here except in anti-examples with irregular faces).

Now, the other candidates:

Rhombicuboctahedron (candidate 2) is an expansion of a cube/octa, so not a truncation. So 0.

Cuboctahedron (1) is a rectification, so 0.

Augmented truncated cube (3): modified, so low.

Great rhombicosidodecahedron (4): is that a truncation of a Platonic? No. So maybe 4.

Partially truncated icosahedron (6): not full truncation, so edges irregular? 1.

Snub cube (7): no, 0.

Great truncated cuboctahedron (8): non-convex, so 0 or 1.

Wait, perhaps I should rank them more precisely. Let me list all again:

1. Cuboctahedron: 0 (rectification, not truncation)
2. Rhombicuboctahedron: 2 (expansion, not truncation)
3. Augmented truncated cube: 2 (modified, so not pure truncation)
4. Great rhombicosidodecahedron: 5 (it's an Archimedean but not a truncation of a Platonic, so broader category)
5. Truncated tetrahedron: 10 (exact match)
6. Partially truncated icosahedron: 1 (incomplete, irregular faces)
7. Snub cube: 0 (not a truncation)
8. Great truncated cuboctahedron: 1 (non-convex and not standard truncation)

Alternatively, maybe the great rhombicosidodecahedron is considered part of the truncations but in a different way. Let me confirm:

The great rhombicosidodecahedron is also called the truncated icosidodecahedron. Wait, actually, the truncated icosidodecahedron is the same as the great rhombicosidodecahedron. It's formed by truncating the icosidodecahedron, which is an Archimedean solid. But the icosidodecahedron itself is a combination of icosahedron and dodecahedron. So this truncation isn't directly from a Platonic solid. Therefore, it doesn't fit the specific theme, so maybe a 3?

Hmm, perhaps I should lower it to 3. Alternatively, maybe the user considers all Archimedean truncations as part of the theme, but the anti-examples have irregularities. Since the great rhombicosidodecahedron is regular, maybe it's a 7? But the original examples are truncations of the original Platonic solids, so maybe it's a step further, hence a 5.

Alternatively, since the examples include the truncated octahedron (which is a truncation of an octahedron, a Platonic solid), the great rhombicosidodecahedron is a truncation of a different Archimedean, so it's a broader category. So 4.

I think I'll go with the following scores, ensuring a range from 0 to 10:

1. 0
2. 2
3. 2
4. 5
5. 10
6. 1
7. 0
8. 1

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be as nuanced as possible, using the full range. Maybe I can adjust a bit more.

For candidate 4 (Great rhombicosidodecahedron): since it's an Archimedean but not a truncation of a Platonic, maybe 4.

Candidate 2 (rhombicuboctahedron): perhaps 3.

Candidate 3 (augmented truncated cube): 3.

Candidate 8: 2?

Let me try again:

1. 0
2. 3
3. 3
4. 4
5. 10
6. 1
7. 0
8. 2

That spreads the scores better. Alternatively, for candidate 4: 5.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 4 is a 6 because it's a more complex truncation but still regular, but not meeting the exact theme's examples.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think of the theme as "truncated regular (Platonic) solids resulting in Archimedean solids with all faces regular". The examples are three of those (cube, octa, ico). The truncated tetrahedron (candidate5) is another, so 10. The truncated dodecahedron would also be 10, but the anti-examples include it with irregular faces, so the regular one is acceptable but not in the examples. The other candidates:

Great rhombicosidodecahedron is a truncation but not of a Platonic, so it's a broader category. So maybe a 4.

Rhombicuboctahedron is a truncation but of a different type (rectified then truncated?), so maybe 3.

Augmented truncated cube: modified, so 2.

Partially truncated icosahedron: 1.

Snub cube:0

Great truncated cuboctahedron: non-convex, so 1.

So final scores:

1.0, 2.3,3.2,4.4,5.10,6.1,7.0,8.1

Wait, but I need to make sure to use numbers 0-10, with some variation. Let me finalize:

1. 0

2. 3

3. 2

4. 5

5. 10

6. 1

7. 0

8. 1

This way, there's a spread from 0 to 10, with some in between. The great rhombicosidodecahedron gets 5 as a middle score since it's an Archimedean but not exactly the truncation of a Platonic. The rhombicuboctahedron gets 3, and augmented is 2.
