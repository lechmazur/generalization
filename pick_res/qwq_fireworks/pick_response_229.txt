Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user gave three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to score the candidates based on matching the specific theme from the examples, not the broader ones related to the anti-examples.

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples: washi paper for calligraphy, amatl bark paper codex, and papyrus scroll. All of these are writing materials made from plant-based fibers, right? They are all traditional, non-durable (compared to stone or clay), and used for writing or records in a specific cultural context. The anti-examples are stone inscriptions, clay tablets, and parchment manuscripts. Wait, parchment is animal skin, so maybe the theme is plant-based writing materials used for traditional writing/records, excluding animal-based (like parchment) or non-organic (stone, clay)? 

So the specific theme might be: traditional plant-based paper or similar materials used for writing, records, or art in a cultural context. The anti-examples use different materials (stone, clay, animal parchment) which are also writing surfaces but not plant-based papers. 

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Digital document: Definitely not physical, so 0? But maybe the theme is about writing mediums, so digital is too different. 0.

2. Metal printing plate: Metal is not plant-based, so anti-example's material. 0 or 1? Maybe 1 because it's a printing tool but not the writing material itself?

3. Woven silk tapestry: Silk is from insects (silkworms), so animal-based, similar to parchment. So anti-example's category. 0 or maybe 1 if considering it's a textile but not exactly writing. Hmm, maybe 2?

Wait, the examples are all papers used for writing. The anti-examples include parchment (animal), stone, clay. So the key is plant-based paper for writing. 

So the candidates need to be plant-based materials used for writing or similar. Let's reassess:

1. Digital: Not physical, so 0.

2. Metal plate: Metal, not plant, so 0.

3. Silk tapestry: Silk is animal-based (silkworms), so like parchment, so 0. But maybe the tapestry isn't for writing? So maybe 1?

Wait, the examples are all about the material used for writing/records. The tapestry is for depicting images, not writing, so even if material is silk, it's not in the same use. So 0?

4. Email: Digital again, so 0.

5. Cave painting: That's on stone/cave walls, which is like the stone inscription (anti-example). So 0.

6. Wooden printing block: Wood is plant-based, but the block is the tool, not the writing material itself. The examples are the writing surface. So maybe 1? Because wood is plant-based but the block isn't the paper.

7. Hemp rope for knot records: Hemp is plant-based, and it's used for records (like Inca quipus). The material is plant, and used for records. So this might be a 7 or 8? Because it's similar to the examples in function (records) and plant material. But the examples are paper (flat, written on), while hemp rope is a different form (knots). So maybe 6?

8. Photographic film: Plastic-based, synthetic, so not plant. 0 or 1. But maybe film is a modern writing/record material, but not plant-based. So 0.

Wait, let me check again:

The examples are all plant-based materials (washi, bark paper, papyrus) used for writing. The anti-examples are non-plant (stone, clay, parchment). So the key is plant-based writing material used for written records or art.

So candidate 7: hemp rope used for knot records. Hemp is plant-based, and it's used for records, so this is similar to the examples. The difference is the method (knots vs writing on paper), but the material and purpose align. So maybe a 7 or 8?

Candidate 6: wooden block. The block is the tool, not the writing surface. The examples are the surface (paper), so maybe a 2?

Candidate 3: silk tapestry. Silk is animal-based, so excluded. 0.

Hmm. Let me try to assign scores:

1. Digital: 0

2. Metal plate: 0

3. Silk tapestry: 0

4. Email: 0

5. Cave painting: 0 (stone surface)

6. Wooden block: Maybe 2 (plant-based, but tool, not the paper)

7. Hemp rope: 7 (plant-based, records, but different form)

8. Film: 0

Wait, but maybe the examples are all flat, sheet-like materials for writing. Hemp rope is a different form. So maybe 5?

Alternatively, if the theme is "plant-based materials used for recording information", then hemp is good. But the examples are papers, so maybe the exact theme is "plant-based paper or similar fibrous sheets used for writing/records". Then hemp rope is not a sheet, so lower. So maybe 4?

Alternatively, the anti-examples include parchment (animal skin), so plant vs animal. So hemp is plant, so better. But the function is different. Hmm.

Let me try to think of the examples again:

Washi (paper), amatl bark paper (paper), papyrus (paper). All are papers made from plants. The anti-examples are other materials (stone, clay, parchment). So the specific theme is "traditional plant-based paper materials used for writing/records". So the key points are: paper-like (sheet form?), plant-based, used for writing/records.

So:

Candidate 7: hemp rope is not paper, but plant-based and for records. So maybe 5? Because it's plant-based and records but not paper.

Candidate 6: wooden block is plant (wood) but the block is the tool, not the writing surface. So maybe 1?

Candidate 3: silk is animal, so 0.

Candidate 5: cave is stone, so 0.

So:

1. 0

2. 0

3. 0

4.0

5.0

6.1

7.5

8.0

Wait, but maybe the hemp rope is a better fit than 5. Let me see. The examples are all writing on paper. The anti-examples include other writing surfaces. So the exact theme is "plant-based paper used for writing". So the anti-examples are non-paper (stone, clay) or non-plant (parchment). So the candidates must be plant-based papers. 

Hemp rope is not a paper, so it's not. So maybe 3?

Wait, but maybe the theme is broader: "plant-based materials used for written/recorded information, in a traditional context". Then the examples are papers, the anti-examples are other materials. Then hemp rope (plant-based, traditional record) would be a good candidate. But the anti-examples include parchment (animal), so plant-based is key. So maybe hemp is a 7? Because it's plant-based and used for records, but not paper. 

Alternatively, the exact theme is "traditional plant-based paper for writing". Then only the examples are papers. So the anti-examples are other writing surfaces (stone, clay, parchment). So the candidates must be plant-based papers. 

Looking at the candidates:

1. Digital: no.

2. Metal plate: no.

3. Silk tapestry: silk is animal, so no.

4. Email: no.

5. Cave painting: stone, no.

6. Wooden block: wood is plant, but the block is the tool, not the paper.

7. Hemp rope: hemp is plant, but the material is rope, not paper.

8. Film: synthetic.

So the only possible candidates are 6 and 7, but they don't fit exactly. 

Wooden block is made from plant (wood), but it's a tool, not the writing surface. So maybe a 2?

Hemp rope is plant-based, used for records, but not paper. Maybe a 4?

So then:

6. 2

7.4

The rest 0.

Alternatively, if the theme is "plant-based materials used for written/recorded information", then 7 would be higher. But the anti-examples include parchment (animal) and stone/clay, so maybe the theme is plant-based, but not necessarily paper. Then:

Hemp rope (plant-based, record) would be 7.

Wooden block: plant-based, but tool. Maybe 3.

But I'm not sure. The examples are all papers, so maybe the theme is specifically paper made from plants. So the key is "paper made from plant fibers".

Then the candidates:

Hemp rope is not paper, so 0 or 1.

Wooden block is not paper. So 0.

Then all candidates except maybe none get above 0 except maybe none. That can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "traditional materials for written records made from organic materials (plant or animal)", but the anti-examples exclude stone/clay. But the anti-examples include parchment (animal), so the theme must exclude animal. So plant-based organic materials for writing.

Thus, hemp rope (plant-based, used for records) would be a 7 or 8.

Wooden block is plant-based, but it's a tool, not the writing surface. So maybe 1.

So final scores:

1.0

2.0

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.1

7.7

8.0

But let me check the original examples again. The examples are all papers used for writing. The anti-examples are other materials (stone, clay, parchment). So the specific theme is "plant-based paper used for writing". Therefore, only plant-based papers qualify. 

Candidates:

7. Hemp rope is not paper, so 0.

6. Wooden block is not paper, so 0.

Therefore, all candidates get 0 except maybe none. But that can't be, because the user expects a range. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the theme is "traditional writing materials made from natural fibers (plant-based)". The anti-examples are non-fiber materials (stone, clay) or animal (parchment). So the key is natural fibers. Then:

Hemp rope is made from hemp fibers, so it's natural fiber. So maybe it's a 7? Because it's a fiber material used for records. The examples are papers (also fibers), so the theme is natural fiber materials for writing/records. So that's possible.

In that case:

Hemp rope (7), wooden block (wood is a fiber? Maybe 3?), but block is a tool.

Alternatively, the theme is "plant-based materials used for writing/records in a traditional context". 

Hemp rope for knot records would be a good fit (like the examples use plant-based for writing, this uses plant-based for records via knots). So maybe 8?

Wait, but the examples are all sheets, while hemp is rope. So maybe a 6?

Alternatively, if the theme is "plant-based materials used for written or recorded information", then:

Hemp is 8 (plant, records), wood block is 2 (tool), digital 0, etc.

I think I need to go with that. So:

1. Digital: 0

2. Metal:0

3. Silk (animal):0

4. Email:0

5. Cave (stone):0

6. Wooden block (plant tool): maybe 2

7. Hemp rope (plant, records):7

8. Film:0

So the scores would be:

1:0

2:0

3:0

4:0

5:0

6:2

7:7

8:0

But maybe the wooden block is 1, because it's plant-based but not the writing surface. 

Alternatively, maybe the wooden block is a tool for making paper (like a printing block), but the examples are the paper itself. So the block isn't the writing material, so 0 or 1.

Hemp rope is a better fit. So final scores:

1.0

2.0

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.1

7.7

8.0

So the output would be:

<number>2</number><score>0</score>

<number>3</number><score>0</score>

<number>4</number><score>0</score>
