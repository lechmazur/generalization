Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are the sexagesimal numeral system, cuneiform script, and the lunar calendar system. The anti-examples are the Gregorian, Julian, and Egyptian calendars. 

Hmm, so the examples all have something in common. Let's break them down. The sexagesimal system is base-60, which is a numeral system. Cuneiform is a writing script used by ancient civilizations like the Sumerians, Babylonians. The lunar calendar is a calendar system based on the moon's cycles. 

The anti-examples are all solar or solar-based calendars (Gregorian, Julian) or the Egyptian calendar, which is also solar with some lunar adjustments. So the key difference here might be that the examples include a lunar calendar, whereas the anti-examples are solar. But the other examples are numeral systems and scripts. So maybe the theme isn't solely about calendars but something else that connects these three.

Wait, perhaps the theme is related to ancient Mesopotamian or Babylonian contributions? Let's see: Cuneiform was indeed used in Mesopotamia. The sexagesimal system is from Babylonians. The lunar calendar might also be part of their system. The anti-examples (Gregorian, Julian, Egyptian) are from different cultures (Roman/Egyptian). So maybe the specific theme is "systems developed by ancient Mesopotamian/Babylonian civilizations"?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "systems based on non-decimal bases" (since base-60 is non-decimal), but the lunar calendar isn't a base system. Hmm, that might not fit. Cuneiform is a script, so maybe the theme is "writing systems and numeral systems from ancient Mesopotamia, along with their lunar calendar"?

Alternatively, perhaps the common theme is that they are all systems that are not based on the decimal system or are non-Western traditional systems. But the anti-examples include the Egyptian calendar, which is also ancient but not Mesopotamian. Wait, but the Egyptian calendar is solar, so maybe the key is that the examples include a lunar calendar, a base-60 system, and a specific script (cuneiform). 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "systems that use base-60, a specific script (cuneiform), or lunar-based calendars". But the anti-examples include other calendars but not the script or numeral system. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "elements of Babylonian/Mesopotamian civilization". Let me think:

- Sexagesimal system: Babylonian.
- Cuneiform: Used by Babylonians and Sumerians.
- Lunar calendar: The Babylonians did use a lunar calendar, so that fits.

Anti-examples are other calendars (Gregorian, Julian, Egyptian), which are not Mesopotamian. So the theme is likely "elements originating from ancient Mesopotamian/Babylonian civilizations".

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Chinese lunar calendar: China is not Mesopotamian, so maybe lower score, but lunar calendars exist elsewhere. But since the example includes a lunar calendar, maybe lunar calendars in general? Wait no, the anti-examples include solar calendars. Wait, the specific theme might be that the three examples are all from Mesopotamia, so the anti-examples are other calendars (Egyptian, etc.), which are not Mesopotamian. So the Chinese lunar calendar would not be from Mesopotamia, so it's an anti-example but not listed. Wait the anti-examples are Gregorian, Julian, Egyptian, so Chinese lunar isn't an anti-example but a possible candidate. So need to see if it's from Mesopotamia. Since it's Chinese, no, so score lower.

2. Aztec calendar: Aztec is Mesoamerican, not Mesopotamian. But maybe their calendar has some lunar aspects? The Aztec calendar had both solar and ritual calendars. Not Mesopotamian, so score lower.

3. Vigesimal (base-20): Used by Mayans, maybe others. Not Mesopotamian. But the example has a base-60 system, so maybe numeral systems from ancient non-decimal cultures? But the specific theme is Mesopotamian, so this would be a no. Unless the theme is "non-decimal numeral systems", but then the anti-examples are calendars, not numeral systems. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "systems that originated in Mesopotamia". Let me check each example:

- Sexagesimal: Yes, Babylonian (Mesopotamian).
- Cuneiform: Yes, Sumerian/Babylonian (Mesopotamian).
- Lunar calendar: The Babylonians did use a lunar calendar, so yes.

So the theme is systems from ancient Mesopotamia. The anti-examples are other calendars (Gregorian, Julian, Egyptian), which are not Mesopotamian. So the candidates need to be systems from Mesopotamia.

Now evaluating each candidate:

1. Chinese lunar calendar: China is separate, so no. But lunar calendars exist elsewhere. Score low, maybe 2?

2. Aztec calendar: Not Mesopotamian. Their calendar is different. Maybe 1?

3. Vigesimal (base-20): Used by Mayans, maybe other cultures. Not Mesopotamian. So 0?

4. Decimal (base-10): Common in many cultures, including modern. Not Mesopotamian. 0.

5. Hieroglyphic script: Egyptian, so not Mesopotamian. 0 or 1?

6. Zodiac with 12 signs: The zodiac as we know it comes from Babylonian astronomy, so maybe this is a good candidate. Babylonians divided the zodiac into 12 signs. So this would be a 10?

Wait, but the zodiac's division into 12 signs is part of Babylonian contributions. So that's a strong match.

7. Mayan calendar: Not Mesopotamian. So low, like 1?

8. Alphabet: The alphabet as we know it (Phoenician, Greek, etc.) not from Mesopotamia. Cuneiform is a logographic script, not an alphabet. So 0 or 1.

Wait, but maybe some aspects? Let me think again.

Wait the examples include cuneiform (script), sexagesimal (numeral system), lunar calendar (calendar). The anti-examples are other calendars (Gregorian, etc.), so the theme is three different types of systems (script, numeral, calendar) from Mesopotamia. So the candidates should be systems in those categories (script, numeral, calendar) from Mesopotamia, or similar ones?

Wait, perhaps the theme is "systems that were used by ancient Mesopotamian civilizations (like Sumer, Babylon)". So each of the examples is a system from there. The anti-examples are other systems (calendars from other regions). So the candidates need to be either:

- A numeral system from Mesopotamia (already have sexagesimal as example; another one would be base-60, but others like base-20 or 10 are not from there. So vigesimal is not, decimal is not. So 3 and 4 are 0.

- A writing system from Mesopotamia: cuneiform is the example. Others like hieroglyphs (Egyptian) or Mayan glyphs are not, so 5 (hieroglyphic) is 0. Alphabet (8) is not.

- A lunar calendar from Mesopotamia: the example is the lunar calendar (Babylonian). The Chinese lunar is another culture's version, so lower score. Aztec calendar (2) is different. Mayan (7) also not. So Chinese lunar calendar (1) might be a 3? Because it's a lunar calendar but not Mesopotamian. But the example is a lunar calendar (from Mesopotamia), so the anti-examples are solar calendars. So lunar calendars in general are acceptable, but only if they are from Mesopotamia? Or is the theme "lunar calendars" regardless of origin? Wait the anti-examples include Egyptian calendar, which is solar. So maybe the theme includes lunar calendars as a category, but the other two examples are numeral system and script. So perhaps the theme is "systems that are either non-decimal numeral systems (like base-60), cuneiform script, or lunar calendars". But the anti-examples are other calendars (Gregorian etc.), which are solar. So maybe the theme is "systems that are either non-decimal, a specific ancient script, or lunar-based". But that seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the three examples are all features of Babylonian/Mesopotamian culture. So the theme is "elements of Babylonian/Mesopotamian civilization". Therefore, the candidates should be elements from that culture.

So:

1. Chinese lunar calendar: Not from Mesopotamia. So low score, maybe 1 or 2.

2. Aztec calendar: No, so 0 or 1.

3. Vigesimal (Mayan base-20): Not Mesopotamian, so 0.

4. Decimal: Not, 0.

5. Hieroglyphic: Egyptian, so 0.

6. Zodiac with 12 signs: Babylonian, so 10.

7. Mayan calendar: No, 0 or 1.

8. Alphabet: Not, 0.

Wait but the zodiac division into 12 signs is indeed from Babylonian astronomy. So that's a strong match. So 6 would be a 10.

The Mayan calendar (7) is their own, so no. The Chinese lunar calendar (1) is a lunar calendar but not from Mesopotamia. Since the example includes a lunar calendar (presumably Babylonian's), then another lunar calendar from another culture would be an anti-example? Wait the anti-examples are Gregorian etc., but Chinese is a lunar calendar. The problem states that the anti-examples are not examples of the specific theme, but could be part of a broader theme. The Chinese lunar calendar is a lunar calendar, so maybe it's part of a broader theme (any lunar calendar), but the specific theme is only the Mesopotamian ones. So the Chinese would be a weaker match, maybe 3.

Similarly, the zodiac (6) is a strong 10.

The Mayan calendar (7) is not, so maybe 1.

The alphabet (8) is not from Mesopotamia, so 0.

Wait, but the alphabet as a concept isn't from there. Cuneiform is a different script.

The Aztec calendar (2) is their own, so 0 or 1.

Vigesimal (3) is Mayan, so 0.

Decimal (4) is common, so 0.

Hieroglyphic (5) is Egyptian, so 0.

So let's assign scores:

1. Chinese lunar calendar: Since it's a lunar calendar, but not Mesopotamian, maybe a 3 (because lunar calendars are part of the theme's category but from another culture).

2. Aztec calendar: 1 (calendar but not lunar in the same way? Or just non-Mesopotamian, so 1).

3. Vigesimal: 0 (numeral system from another culture).

4. Decimal: 0.

5. Hieroglyphic: 0.

6. Zodiac 12 signs: 10.

7. Mayan calendar: 1 (calendar but not Mesopotamian).

8. Alphabet: 0 (script but not cuneiform).

Wait, but maybe the zodiac is a 10, and the others as above. Let me check again.

Alternatively, the zodiac division into 12 is part of Babylonian contributions, so 10. The others:

The Chinese lunar calendar is a lunar calendar, which is part of the theme's calendar aspect but from a different culture. Since the specific theme is the Babylonian ones, this would be an anti-example but not listed. The anti-examples are Gregorian etc., so Chinese is not an anti-example but a candidate. Since it's a lunar calendar but not Babylonian, it's a partial match. Maybe 3.

The Aztec calendar has a solar and ritual calendar, but not lunar-based like the Babylonian. So maybe 1.

The Mayan calendar is a different system, so 1.

The Vigesimal is a numeral system but not from Mesopotamia, so 0.

Decimal is 0.

Hieroglyphs are 0.

Alphabet is 0.

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 1

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 10

7. 1

8. 0

Wait but maybe the zodiac is part of the Babylonian's contributions, so that's a 10. The Mayan calendar (7) is not, so 1. The Aztec (2) also 1. The Chinese lunar (1) 3. The rest 0 except zodiac.
