Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the initial examples (Merlin's Cave, Gollum's Arch, King Kong's Rock) share, while the anti-examples (Mount Doom, Excalibur Peak, Thor's Hammer) don't. 

Looking at the examples, each has a proper noun (a name from mythology, literature, or pop culture) followed by a geographical feature or structure: "Cave," "Arch," "Rock." The key seems to be that these are landmarks or natural features named after a character or entity associated with them in some story or myth. 

Now, the anti-examples also follow a similar structure but might deviate in a specific way. For instance, Mount Doom is from Lord of the Rings but is a mountain tied to a plot element (the destruction of the ring) rather than a specific character's personal association. Excalibur Peak uses Excalibur, which is an object (a sword) rather than a character's name. Thor's Hammer refers to Mjölnir, again an object, not a location tied to Thor himself. So the anti-examples either use objects or places tied to events rather than characters' direct associations.

So the specific theme is likely: [Character/Entity's Name] + [Geographical Feature/Structure], where the feature is directly associated with the character in their story/myth as a place they inhabit, guard, or are famously linked to, not just a place named after them for another reason or tied to an object.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. **Prometheus' Rock**: Prometheus is a mythological figure. A rock associated with him? In mythology, Prometheus is known for stealing fire and being punished by Zeus, tied to a rock. That fits exactly the theme—character's name + place they're famously linked to. So this should be a strong candidate. Maybe 8 or 9?

Wait, but the examples all use "Cave," "Arch," "Rock" as the features. Rock is directly used here, which matches. Prometheus' association with a rock (as in his punishment) is a direct link. So maybe a 10? Hmm, but let me check others first.

2. **Hercules' Pillars**: Hercules is a character, and his pillars are the Pillars of Hercules, which are real geographical features (Gibraltar and Ceuta). These are landmarks named after him, so this seems to fit perfectly. The pillars are directly associated with Hercules in mythology. So this could be a 10 as well. But wait, the original examples are specific to each character's own feature (Merlin's Cave, Gollum's Arch, King Kong's Rock). The Pillars of Hercules are a real historical name, so maybe that's part of the broader theme? Wait, but the anti-examples include Excalibur Peak, which uses an object (Excalibur) instead of a character's direct location. So if Hercules' Pillars are a recognized landmark tied to him, that's good. Maybe 10?

3. **Poseidon's Trident**: Trident is an object, not a geographical feature. The anti-examples include Thor's Hammer (object), so this should be a 0. Since Poseidon's trident is his weapon, not a place. So 0.

4. **Neptune's Throne**: Neptune is the Roman equivalent of Poseidon. Throne is a structure, but a throne isn't a geographical feature. Unless it's a place called Neptune's Throne, but the term "throne" is more of a man-made structure or symbolic. The examples use natural features (cave, arch, rock). So maybe low score, like 2? Since it's a structure but not a natural feature.

5. **Medusa's Head**: Medusa's head is the object that Perseus carried, so again an object, not a geographical feature. The head is part of her myth, but the head itself isn't a place. So 0.

6. **Hobbit's Hill**: The Hobbit's Hill might refer to the Shire, like Bag End. But "Hobbit" is a race, not a specific character. The examples use specific characters (Merlin, Gollum, King Kong). Using a general term like "Hobbit" instead of a specific name (e.g., Bilbo's Hill) might lower the score. Maybe 3 or 4? Since it's a geographical feature but uses a group name instead of a character's name.

7. **Odysseus' Cave**: Odysseus is a character. A cave associated with him? In the Odyssey, there's the cave of Polyphemus the Cyclops, which Odysseus entered. But is there a specific "Odysseus' Cave" directly tied to him? Maybe not as direct as Merlin's Cave. Alternatively, if there's a place named after him, but perhaps it's less direct. Maybe a 7? Since it's a character and a cave, but maybe not as iconic as the examples. Alternatively, if it's a real named place in mythology, maybe higher. Hmm.

8. **Zeus's Boulder**: Zeus is a character. The boulder might refer to the one Atlas holds, but Atlas is a different figure. Alternatively, maybe the thunderbolt is his symbol. A boulder isn't directly tied to Zeus's myth as a location. Unless it's referring to the mountain where he resides? But "Boulder" isn't a standard feature. Maybe 3? Since it's a geographical feature but not a well-known association.

Wait, let me recheck each candidate with the criteria:

Specific theme: [Specific Character] + [Natural Feature] tied to the character in their story.

Examples all have the character's name (Merlin, Gollum, King Kong) followed by a natural feature (cave, arch, rock) that's specifically linked to them. 

Anti-examples: Mount Doom is a place tied to an event (destruction of the ring), not a character's personal association. Excalibur Peak uses an object (Excalibur) not a character. Thor's Hammer is an object again.

So for the candidates:

1. **Prometheus' Rock**: Yes, Prometheus was chained to a rock. So this fits perfectly. 10?

But wait, in the examples, the features are named after the character, like Merlin's Cave. So if "Prometheus' Rock" is a specific place in mythology where he was punished, then yes. So 10.

2. **Hercules' Pillars**: The Pillars of Hercules are real and named after him. They are geographical features (mountains) at the Strait of Gibraltar. So this fits. 10?

3. **Poseidon's Trident**: Object, so 0.

4. **Neptune's Throne**: Throne is a structure, not a natural feature. 0 or 1? Maybe 1 because throne could be a place, but not natural. Maybe 2.

5. **Medusa's Head**: Object, 0.

6. **Hobbit's Hill**: Not a specific character, so maybe 3? Since "Hobbit" is a race, not a name. But if it's referring to the Shire's hill, but the name uses a group, so lower score.

7. **Odysseus' Cave**: There's the cave of the Cyclops (Polyphemus), which is part of Odysseus's journey, but the cave isn't named after Odysseus. So maybe not as direct. So maybe 5? Since it's a character and a cave, but the association isn't as direct as Merlin's Cave. Alternatively, if there's a place called Odysseus' Cave in some myth, but I'm not sure. Maybe 5 or 6.

8. **Zeus's Boulder**: Zeus is associated with lightning, not a boulder. Unless the boulder is part of a myth. Maybe Atlas's boulder? But that's Atlas. So probably 2.

Wait, let me adjust again. 

1. Prometheus' Rock: 10.

2. Hercules' Pillars: 10? But maybe the original examples use singular features (Cave, Arch, Rock). Hercules' Pillars are plural, but still a geographical feature. So maybe 10.

Wait, but the examples are singular: Merlin's Cave (singular), Gollum's Arch (singular), King Kong's Rock (singular). Hercules' Pillars are plural, but the structure is still a pair of pillars as a landmark. So maybe it's acceptable. So 10.

Alternatively, maybe the anti-examples include Excalibur Peak, which is singular but uses an object. So Hercules' Pillars is okay. So 10.

But maybe the anti-examples have Mount Doom, which is a mountain, so a different structure but still a geographical feature. So Hercules' Pillars should be okay. So 10.

3. Poseidon's Trident: 0.

4. Neptune's Throne: 1 or 2. Since throne is a structure, not natural. Maybe 2.

5. Medusa's Head: 0.

6. Hobbit's Hill: 3. Because it's a group name, not a specific character. Maybe 3.

7. Odysseus' Cave: Maybe 5 or 6. Since Odysseus is a character, and a cave is a natural feature, but the cave isn't named after him. Unless there's a specific cave in the story named after him. In the Odyssey, the Cyclops' cave is just called the cave of Polyphemus, not Odysseus's. So maybe it's a stretch. So maybe 4.

8. Zeus's Boulder: Zeus isn't directly linked to a boulder in his myths. His main symbols are the thunderbolt and the eagle. So maybe 1 or 2. Let's say 2.

But let me check again. 

Wait, for candidate 7: If "Odysseus' Cave" is referring to a place where he stayed or a significant cave in his journey, even if it's not named after him, but the structure is a cave, then maybe it's a 6. Alternatively, since the examples have the feature named after the character, like Merlin's Cave (the cave is Merlin's), so if Odysseus' Cave is a place that belongs to or is associated with him specifically, like a place he lived or a significant spot. In the story, his home is Ithaca, but maybe there's a cave there. Alternatively, the cave of the nymphs? Not sure. Maybe it's ambiguous, so 5.

Similarly, Zeus's Boulder: Maybe the rock where he was born? Not sure. But probably not a standard association. So 2.

So final scores:

1. 10

2. 10

3. 0

4. 2

5. 0

6. 3

7. 5

8. 2

Wait, but the user said to use the full range from 0-10, so maybe I should spread them more. Let me see if any are in the middle.

Alternatively, maybe Hercules' Pillars are a well-known landmark, so 10 is okay. Prometheus' Rock is a direct association, so 10.

Hobbit's Hill: Maybe 4 instead of 3.

Odysseus' Cave: Maybe 6? If the user thinks that even if not named after him, but associated with his journey, but the examples are named after the character. So if it's named after him, then it's better. Since I don't know if there's a place called Odysseus' Cave, perhaps 3?

Alternatively, since the question is based on the examples given, which are all named after the character, so if the candidate is structured as [Character]'s [Feature], even if the association isn't as direct, it's still better than using a group name.

Wait, "Hobbit's Hill" uses a group, so it's worse than "Odysseus' Cave" which uses a specific character. So maybe:

6. 3

7. 6

8. 1 (since Zeus's Boulder is weaker than Neptune's Throne? Or maybe both are low.)

Alternatively, let's see:

Perhaps:

1. Prometheus' Rock: 10

2. Hercules' Pillars: 10

3. 0

4. Neptune's Throne: 2

5. 0

6. Hobbit's Hill: 3

7. Odysseus' Cave: 7 (since it's a character and a cave, even if not as iconic as Merlin's, but better than others)

Wait, maybe Odysseus' Cave is better. Since Odysseus is a major character, and a cave is a natural feature, even if the cave isn't specifically named after him, but the structure is a cave linked to him in the story. For example, the cave of the Cyclops is part of his journey, but the name isn't "Odysseus' Cave". However, the user's examples might prioritize the structure of [Character]'s [Feature], regardless of whether the feature is actually named after them in the story, but just following that pattern. Wait, but the examples are actual named places: Merlin's Cave is a real place in Arthurian legend? Or is it fictional?

Actually, Merlin's Cave is a fictional place in the stories, like in the tales of Merlin. Similarly, Gollum's Arch might be a fictional place from Lord of the Rings (though I'm not sure; Gollum's lair is the caves near Mordor, but maybe "Arch" is a specific structure). King Kong's Rock would be the summit of Skull Island where he stands. So the key is that in their respective stories, the feature is directly tied to the character's name. So for Odysseus' Cave, if there's no such named place in the Odyssey, then it's less direct. So maybe 5.

Alternatively, if we assume that the structure just needs to be a natural feature associated with the character, even if not explicitly named, then maybe higher. But since the examples are named after the character, the name itself is important. So "Odysseus' Cave" would have to be a place in the story actually named that. Since I don't recall such a place, perhaps it's a 4 or 5.

Hmm. To make sure I'm not overcomplicating:

The examples are all [Character]'s [Feature], where the feature is a natural/geographical one tied to the character's story. The anti-examples use objects or non-character-related features (Mount Doom is tied to the ring, not a character's personal association).

Thus:

1. Prometheus' Rock: Direct association (his punishment), so 10.

2. Hercules' Pillars: Well-known geographical feature named after him, so 10.

3. Poseidon's Trident: Object, 0.

4. Neptune's Throne: Structure not natural, 1.

5. Medusa's Head: Object, 0.

6. Hobbit's Hill: Group name, so lower. 3.

7. Odysseus' Cave: Character + cave. If the cave is part of his story but not specifically named after him, but the structure fits the pattern, maybe 6? Or since it's named after him, even if fictional, like the examples are, then 8? Wait, but the examples are from specific works (Merlin from Arthurian, Gollum from LotR, King Kong from the movie). So Odysseus' Cave could be considered as a made-up place in his myth, so 8? Hmm, but maybe the user expects that the name must be from an existing reference. Since I'm not sure, perhaps 7.

8. Zeus's Boulder: Zeus isn't linked to a boulder in his myths, so 2.

Wait, but if the question allows for hypothetical constructs as long as the structure is [Character]'s [Feature], then maybe 4? Since it's a character and a natural feature, even if not canon. But the anti-examples include Excalibur Peak (object), so using a natural feature but with a weak association might get a low score. Maybe 3?

Alternatively, let's finalize:

1. 10

2. 10

3. 0

4. 2

5. 0

6. 3

7. 6

8. 2

But the user wants a full range, so maybe adjust some to spread the scores more. Let me see:

If I give some middle numbers:

7. Odysseus' Cave: Maybe 6 or 7.

8. Zeus's Boulder: 1 or 2.

Alternatively, maybe Neptune's Throne is 1, Zeus's Boulder is 1.

But I'll proceed with the initial assessment.
