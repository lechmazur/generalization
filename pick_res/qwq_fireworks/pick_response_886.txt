Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the given examples. The examples are The Satanic Verses, The Grapes of Wrath, and Doctor Zhivago. 

The Satanic Verses was banned in several Muslim-majority countries, probably due to religious reasons. The Grapes of Wrath was banned in parts of the US during the Great Depression, likely because of its portrayal of social and economic issues, maybe seen as too critical of the government or capitalist systems. Doctor Zhivago was banned in the Soviet Union, which I think is because of its critique of communism and the Soviet regime.

So the common theme here seems to be books that were banned due to their content challenging the political, religious, or social norms of the governing authority in specific regions or countries. The bans were imposed by those authorities, not just any group. The key points are: specific countries/countries with certain majorities, government or authoritative bans, and the content being offensive or critical to that authority's ideology.

Now the anti-examples are 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and Brave New World. These are classic dystopian novels that are often banned for their themes of censorship and totalitarianism. But the problem states that these are not exact matches of the specific theme but are part of a broader theme. So the specific theme must be more narrow. The anti-examples are banned for their content about censorship and oppressive regimes in a general sense, but the original examples are banned by specific regimes (Soviet Union, Muslim-majority countries, etc.) for content that directly challenges those regimes or their ideologies. 

So the difference is that the anti-examples are about books that talk about censorship and authoritarianism in a fictional setting, whereas the original examples are books that were actually banned by real-world authorities for reasons related to their own governance or religious beliefs. The key is that the ban is due to the book's direct relevance to the banning authority's context, not just the theme of censorship in general.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger: Banned for explicit content and themes, like profanity, sexual references, and mental health issues. It's often challenged in schools, but not by a government or a specific authority due to political/religious reasons. So this might not fit the specific theme as the bans here are more about moral content rather than challenging a regime or religion.

2. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Banned for racial slurs and offensive language towards Black people. The bans here are more about racial sensitivity and are often school or community-based, not a government enforcing it because it challenges their ideology. So similar to the first, not matching the specific theme.

3. Animal Farm by George Orwell: Banned in the Soviet Union and communist countries. This directly fits the theme because it's a critique of Stalinism and communism, so the ban was by the Soviet Union (a specific authority) due to the content opposing their ideology. This should be a strong match, maybe 10? Wait, but the anti-examples include Orwell's 1984. However, the problem says the anti-examples don't fit the specific theme but could fit a broader one. Since Animal Farm was actually banned by the Soviet Union, just like Doctor Zhivago was banned there too, this should be a good example. So maybe a 10?

Wait, but the user says that the anti-examples are not exact matches. The original examples include Doctor Zhivago banned in the Soviet Union, so Animal Farm is exactly like that. Therefore, this is a direct match, so 10.

4. Ulysses by James Joyce: Banned for obscenity and sexual content. The US and some other countries had bans initially due to perceived indecency. This is more about moral or prurient content rather than challenging a political or religious authority. So this might be a 3 or 4?

5. To Kill a Mockingbird: Banned for racial themes, use of the N-word, and discussions of rape. Again, these are more about racial content and moral issues, not necessarily a government banning it because it challenges their political system. So maybe a 2 or 3.

6. Lady Chatterley's Lover: Banned for sexual content and obscenity, especially in the UK and other places. Similar to Ulysses, it's about explicit content rather than political critique. So maybe 2-4.

7. Lolita: Banned for its sexual content, particularly involving a minor. Again, moral objections, so low score, maybe 1-3.

8. The Color Purple: Banned for explicit content, sexual themes, and portrayal of violence against women. Again, similar to others, so maybe 2-4.

Wait, but let me check each candidate again:

Looking back at the examples:

- The Satanic Verses: Religious reasons (Muslim-majority countries)
- The Grapes of Wrath: Banned during the Depression, possibly for criticizing capitalism or the government's handling of the crisis (but maybe more about social unrest and labor issues)
- Doctor Zhivago: Soviet Union banned it for its critique of communism and portrayal of the revolution's aftermath.

So the key elements are:

1. The bans are imposed by the government or a dominant authority (like religious authorities in Muslim countries)
2. The reason for the ban is directly related to the content challenging the authority's ideology, political system, religion, or governance.

So for each candidate:

1. Catcher in the Rye: Banned in schools for explicit content, not by a government for ideological reasons. So 0-2.

2. Huck Finn: Banned in schools and communities for racism, not government bans for ideology. 0-2.

3. Animal Farm: Banned in the Soviet Union (government) for opposing communism. Direct match. 10.

4. Ulysses: Banned for obscenity by authorities (like the US post office), but not because it challenges a political system. More about morality. So maybe 3-5? Wait, in the US, the ban was more about obscenity, so not the same as the examples. So maybe 2.

5. To Kill a Mockingbird: Banned in schools for racial content, but not by the government as an authority challenging their own system (since the government at the time was enforcing segregation, so maybe the ban was more about maintaining that, but is that considered challenging the system? Hmm. If the book is seen as critical of segregation, then maybe the Southern states banned it. So could be a bit more. Maybe 4?

Wait, To Kill a Mockingbird was banned in some places for its racial themes, which did challenge the prevailing norms in the South. But was it a government ban? Probably more at the school district level, not federal or state government. So maybe 3?

6. Lady Chatterley's Lover: The UK banned it for obscenity. The reason was sexual content, not challenging the government's ideology. So 2.

7. Lolita: Similarly, banned for sexual content. 1.

8. The Color Purple: Banned for explicit content and themes of sexism, but again, not challenging a political regime. 3.

Wait, but let me think again. The original examples include The Grapes of Wrath, which was banned during the Great Depression in parts of the US. That was due to its portrayal of labor rights and the plight of migrant workers, which some authorities might have seen as communist propaganda or a challenge to the existing economic system. So in that case, the ban was by local authorities (maybe school boards or states) against a book that was critical of the government's handling of the Depression.

So if a book is banned by authorities (even local) because it challenges the existing social/political/economic system or ideology, that's a match.

So To Kill a Mockingbird was banned in some Southern states because it criticized racism and segregation, which were part of the social structure. So if the local authorities banned it to uphold segregation, then that might be a match. Similarly, The Color Purple deals with racial and gender issues, so maybe banned in places where those issues are sensitive.

Similarly, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was banned in some places for its racial language, which was seen as promoting anti-racist views (since Huck helps a Black man escape), so authorities in the South might have banned it to maintain segregation. So maybe these have higher scores.

Wait, so maybe I need to reassess.

For example:

3. Animal Farm is a clear 10.

4. Ulysses: banned for obscenity, not political, so 2.

5. To Kill a Mockingbird: if banned by authorities (like school boards) in the South for challenging segregation, then maybe a 7?

Wait, but the original examples include The Grapes of Wrath, which was banned in parts of the US. The reason there was due to its socialist themes and criticism of capitalism, so similar to challenging the existing system. So To Kill a Mockingbird's challenge to racism could be seen as challenging the social system. So maybe a 7?

Similarly, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was banned in the South for its anti-slavery themes (though it's a complex book, but the ban was because of the racial content and the portrayal of a Black character in a more human light). So maybe a 6?

Wait, but the user's examples include The Grapes of Wrath, which was banned during the Depression in the US. So if a book is banned in the US for challenging the existing social/economic order, then To Kill a Mockingbird and Huckleberry Finn might fit.

But then, how does this compare to the other examples? The Satanic Verses was banned in Muslim-majority countries for religious reasons, Doctor Zhivago in the Soviet Union for political reasons. The Grapes of Wrath in the US for political/social reasons.

So the key is that the ban is by an authority (government, religious authorities) because the book challenges their ideology or system.

So for each candidate:

1. Catcher in the Rye: Banned for explicit content (not ideology). 1.

2. Huck Finn: Banned in the South (local authorities) for challenging racial hierarchy. 7?

3. Animal Farm: 10.

4. Ulysses: Banned for obscenity. 2.

5. To Kill a Mockingbird: Banned for challenging racial segregation. 8? Because it's a direct challenge to the existing social order enforced by authorities.

6. Lady Chatterley's Lover: Obscenity. 2.

7. Lolita: Obscenity. 1.

8. The Color Purple: Banned for racial/gender issues, which challenge societal norms. Maybe 6?

Hmm, this is getting more nuanced. Let me go through each again:

1. Catcher in the Rye: Mostly challenged in schools for language and themes like rebellion, but not by a government to protect their ideology. So low score, maybe 1-3.

2. Huck Finn: Banned in places because it was seen as undermining racial hierarchy. So if the banning authorities (like schools in the South) did it to maintain segregation, then it's similar to The Grapes of Wrath. So maybe 7-8?

3. Animal Farm: 10.

4. Ulysses: 2.

5. To Kill a Mockingbird: When it was first published, some places banned it because it dealt with race, and in the 60s, it was challenged for the same. So if the authorities (like Southern states) banned it to uphold segregation, then 8 or 9? But maybe not as direct as Doctor Zhivago or Animal Farm.

6. Lady Chatterley's Lover: 2.

7. Lolita: 1.

8. The Color Purple: Banned for its portrayal of Black women's experiences, which challenges societal norms. Maybe 5?

Alternatively, maybe the user's examples are more about books banned by governments (national level) rather than local authorities. The Grapes of Wrath was banned in parts of the US (maybe local or state level), Doctor Zhivago in the Soviet Union (national), Satanic Verses in multiple countries (national governments). So if the candidate's bans are at the national level, that's better.

Looking at the candidates:

- Animal Farm was banned in the Soviet Union (national), so 10.

- The Color Purple might have been banned in some countries, but not sure. In the US, it was challenged in some school districts, but not at the national level. So maybe lower.

- To Kill a Mockingbird had some state-level bans, like in Alabama, so maybe 7.

- Huck Finn was banned in some states, so 6?

Hmm, this is tricky. I need to assign scores between 0-10 based on how close they are to the examples.

Let me try to assign scores:

1. The Catcher in the Rye: 2 (banned for content, not ideology)
2. Huck Finn: 6 (banned in some states for racial content challenging segregation)
3. Animal Farm: 10 (direct match)
4. Ulysses: 3 (banned for obscenity, not ideology)
5. To Kill a Mockingbird: 7 (banned in some states for racial themes challenging segregation)
6. Lady Chatterley's Lover: 2 (obscenity)
7. Lolita: 1 (obscenity)
8. The Color Purple: 4 (banned for racial/gender content, but maybe more local than national)

Wait, but The Color Purple was banned in some places for its content, but not sure if it was government-imposed. If it's school boards, then maybe 3-4.

Alternatively, maybe The Color Purple was challenged more recently for explicit content, so lower.

Alternatively, To Kill a Mockingbird could be a 8 because it's a classic example of a banned book for racial themes, similar to The Grapes of Wrath's social themes.

I think I need to make a decision here. Let's try to go with:

1. 2
2. 6
3. 10
4. 3
5. 7
6. 2
7. 1
8. 4

But let me check the original examples again. The Grapes of Wrath was banned in parts of the US during the Depression. That's a federal/state level? Probably state/local, but still, it's a match. So To Kill a Mockingbird is similar in that it was banned in some states for challenging racial norms, so maybe 8.

Similarly, Huck Finn might be 7.

So adjusting:

1. 2
2. 7
3. 10
4. 3
5. 8
6. 2
7. 1
8. 5

Alternatively, The Color Purple could be 5 because it's dealing with race and gender, but maybe not as directly as To Kill a Mockingbird.

Alternatively, maybe The Catcher in the Rye is 3 because it was banned in some schools for its critique of societal norms, but not exactly the same as the examples. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe To Kill a Mockingbird is a 9? Because it's a strong example of a book banned for challenging racial segregation, which was a core part of the US's social structure at the time. That's similar to The Grapes of Wrath's challenge to economic systems. So 9?

But the user's examples include The Grapes of Wrath as a direct match, so To Kill a Mockingbird would be similar. So 9?

Hmm, perhaps:

1. Catcher in the Rye: 3 (some bans for content, but not ideology)
2. Huck Finn: 7 (banned for racial content challenging authority)
3. Animal Farm:10
4. Ulysses: 3 (obscenity)
5. To Kill a Mockingbird:9 (banned for racial themes, challenging segregation)
6. Lady Chatterley's Lover:2 (obscenity)
7. Lolita:1
8. The Color Purple:5 (racial/gender themes, maybe not as direct as To Kill)

But I think this is getting too high. The user's anti-examples include 1984, which is a book banned in some countries, but the user says it's an anti-example. So 1984 is a book that's about censorship, but the theme here is books banned by authorities for challenging their own ideology. 1984 would be banned by a government that's like the one in the book, but in reality, it was banned in some places (like China, maybe?), but the user says it's an anti-example. So maybe the key is that the book's content directly relates to the banning authority's system. For example, Doctor Zhivago was banned in the Soviet Union because it criticized the USSR. Similarly, Animal Farm was banned in the USSR for criticizing communism. The Grapes of Wrath was banned in the US for its socialist themes challenging capitalism. Satanic Verses in Muslim countries for religious reasons. So the book must be banned in the country whose ideology it's criticizing.

Therefore, To Kill a Mockingbird was banned in the US South for challenging racial segregation, which was part of the US's social system at the time. So that fits. Similarly, Huck Finn was banned in the South for similar reasons. So those are good matches.

So maybe:

1. Catcher in the Rye: 3 (banned in schools for content, not system challenge)
2. Huck Finn: 8 (banned in the South for challenging segregation)
3. Animal Farm:10
4. Ulysses: 2 (obscenity)
5. To Kill a Mockingbird:9 (banned in the South for challenging segregation)
6. Lady Chatterley's Lover:2 (obscenity)
7. Lolita:1 (obscenity)
8. The Color Purple:6 (banned for racial/gender themes in some places, but maybe not as direct as To Kill)

Alternatively, maybe The Color Purple was banned in some African countries? Not sure. If it's mainly US school bans, then lower.

Alternatively, let's finalize:

1. 3
2. 7
3. 10
4. 2
5. 8
6. 2
7. 1
8. 5

This seems reasonable. Let me check each again:

- Animal Farm is clearly 10.

- To Kill a Mockingbird gets 8 because it's a strong example of a book banned in the US for challenging racial policies.

- Huck Finn is 7, similar but maybe slightly less direct?

- The Color Purple gets 5 because it's dealing with race and gender but maybe not as directly as To Kill.

- Ulysses and Lady Chatterley's Lover are 2 because they're about obscenity, not ideology.

- Lolita is 1.

- Catcher in the Rye is 3 because it's banned for content but not challenging the system.

This uses the full range from 1 to 10, with some variation. I think this works.
