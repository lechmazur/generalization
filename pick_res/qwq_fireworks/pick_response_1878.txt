Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are Ingapirca, Kuelap, and Pukara de Quitor. Let me recall what I know about these sites.

Ingapirca is in Ecuador, associated with the Cañari and later the Inca. It's a ruin that includes both Cañari and Inca structures, so maybe it's a pre-Columbian site with some Inca influence? Kuelap is in Peru, part of the Chachapoya culture, a fortress-like structure high in the Andes. Pukara de Quitor is in Chile, a pre-Columbian fort in the Atacama Desert, constructed by the Quitus people, later used by the Incas.

Looking for commonalities: All three are pre-Columbian, located in the Andean region (Ecuador, Peru, Chile). They seem to be defensive or fortress-like structures, possibly associated with specific indigenous groups before the Inca expansion. Maybe they are examples of pre-Inca or indigenous defensive sites that were later incorporated into the Inca Empire?

Now the anti-examples: Tiwanaku is a major ancient city in Bolivia, a significant pre-Inca civilization. Ollantaytambo is a Inca archaeological site in Peru, which is an Inca fortress and town. Chan Chan is the capital of the Chimú Empire in Peru, a large adobe city. These are important sites but perhaps more central to their respective cultures (Tiwanaku, Chimú, Inca) rather than being peripheral defensive structures taken over by others. So the specific theme might exclude major urban centers or core cultural capitals, focusing instead on defensive or peripheral sites that were built by local groups before being taken over by the Inca.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. Ciudad Perdida (Teyuna): This is an ancient city in Colombia, associated with the Tairona people. It's a pre-Columbian site, but it's a city rather than a fortress. However, it's in the Andes and might have defensive aspects. Not sure if it's more like the examples or anti-examples. Maybe a 5 or 6?

2. Teotihuacan: In Mexico, a major Mesoamerican city, not Andean. The examples are all Andean. So this is outside the geographical region, so probably a 0 or 1.

3. El Tajín: Also in Mexico, a Classic-era city, part of the Huastec culture. Again, Mesoamerican, so not Andean. So likely a 0 or 1.

4. Machu Picchu: Inca site in Peru. The anti-examples include Ollantaytambo which is Inca, but maybe the theme excludes major Inca sites? Since the examples include Pukara de Quitor which was later Inca, but the anti-examples include Ollantaytambo which is Inca core. So maybe Machu Picchu is a major Inca site, so 0? Or maybe it's a fortress? Wait, Machu Picchu is an Inca citadel, but not sure if it's considered a defensive site in the same way. Hmm, maybe a 2?

5. Chichen Itza: Again, in Mexico, Maya site. Mesoamerican, so not Andean. Definitely 0.

6. Sacsayhuamán: Inca site near Cusco, known for its massive stone walls. It's a fortress, part of the Inca Empire. Since Ollantaytambo is an anti-example (Inca), then Sacsayhuamán might be similar, so maybe a 0 or 1.

7. Caral: In Peru, the oldest center of civilization in the Americas (Supe Valley). Pre-Columbian, Andean, but it's a city, not a fortress. So maybe a 2 or 3?

8. Copán: In Honduras, Maya site, so Mesoamerican. Definitely 0.

Wait, need to be careful. The key is that the examples are all Andean defensive sites built by local groups before Inca, but the anti-examples are major cities (Tiwanaku, Chan Chan) or Inca core sites (Ollantaytambo). So the specific theme is Andean pre-Inca defensive sites that were later Inca, not major urban centers. 

Ciudad Perdida: Tairona, Colombia, defensive? Not sure. It's a city but in the mountains. Maybe a 4?

Teotihuacan: Not Andean, 0.

El Tajín: Mesoamerican, 0.

Machu Picchu: Inca, so maybe 0 or if it's a fortress, but since Ollantaytambo is an anti-example (Inca), then Machu Picchu would also be an anti-example. 0.

Chichen Itza: 0.

Sacsayhuamán: Inca fortress, so like Ollantaytambo which is an anti-example. So 0.

Caral: Not defensive, major city, so 0 or 1.

Copán: 0.

Wait, maybe Caral is too early and not defensive. So Caral 1.

Ciudad Perdida: Maybe 4? Since it's in the Andes, but not sure if defensive enough. Maybe 3?

Hmm, need to adjust. Let me think again:

Ingapirca (Ecuador, Cañari-Inca), Kuelap (Peru, Chachapoya fortress), Pukara de Quitor (Chile, Quitus-Inca). All are Andean, defensive structures, built by local groups before Inca, then incorporated. So the theme is: Andean pre-Inca defensive sites (fortresses or pueblos) that were later Inca.

Anti-examples: Tiwanaku (pre-Inca but major city, not defensive?), Ollantaytambo (Inca core fortress?), Chan Chan (Chimú capital, not Inca).

So candidates:

1. Ciudad Perdida: Tairona, Colombia, a city but in the mountains. Maybe defensive, but not a fortress? The Tairona were before Spanish, but not sure if they were incorporated into Inca. If the Tairona weren't Inca, then maybe it doesn't fit. The examples were taken over by Inca. So if Ciudad Perdida was not Inca, then it doesn't fit. I think the Tairona were not conquered by the Inca, so this might not qualify. So maybe 2.

2. Teotihuacan: Not Andean, 0.

3. El Tajín: Mesoamerican, 0.

4. Machu Picchu: Inca, so anti-example, 0.

5. Chichen Itza: 0.

6. Sacsayhuamán: Inca, 0.

7. Caral: Pre-Inca, but not defensive, major city, so 0.

8. Copán: 0.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with Caral. It's in Peru, but it's much older (around 2600 BCE), way before Inca. So not related. So 0.

Ciudad Perdida: Maybe 3 because it's in the Andes, but not Inca. Hmm, so maybe even less. Wait, the examples were all sites that were later Inca. So if the candidate wasn't Inca, it's worse. So Ciudad Perdida was Tairona, not Inca, so maybe 1.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me recheck each candidate:

1. Ciudad Perdida: Tairona, pre-Columbian, but not Inca. So doesn't fit the 'later Inca' part. So maybe 1.

2. Teotihuacan: 0.

3. El Tajín: 0.

4. Machu Picchu: 0.

5. Chichen Itza: 0.

6. Sacsayhuamán: 0.

7. Caral: 0.

8. Copán: 0.

Wait, but maybe some have partial fits. For example, Sacsayhuamán is a fortress but Inca, so similar to Ollantaytambo which is an anti-example, so 0.

Alternatively, maybe Sacsayhuamán is a fortress but Inca, so it's an anti-example. So 0.

Caral is too early and not defensive, so 0.

Ciudad Perdida is Andean, but not Inca, so maybe a 2?

Alternatively, if the theme doesn't require Inca incorporation, but just defensive Andean sites, but the examples were all incorporated by Inca. The anti-examples include Tiwanaku which is pre-Inca but major city. So the theme requires defensive structures built by local groups before Inca, then taken over by Inca. So:

Ciudad Perdida: Not taken by Inca? Then it's excluded. So 1.

Sacsayhuamán: Inca, so excluded. 0.

So the only possible candidates with some points would be...

Wait, maybe El Tajín has some defensive features? No, it's a ceremonial center.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try again:

The three examples are all in the Andes, defensive sites (pueblos, fortresses) built by local Andean cultures before the Inca, then incorporated into the Inca Empire. The anti-examples are either major cities (Tiwanaku, Chan Chan) or Inca core sites (Ollantaytambo), which are not peripheral defensive structures taken over from others.

So the theme is: Andean pre-Inca defensive sites (fortresses, pueblos) that were later conquered and used by the Inca.

Now, the candidates:

1. Ciudad Perdida (Teyuna): Tairona, Colombia. It's a pre-Columbian site, but the Tairona were not conquered by the Inca. The Inca expansion reached as far north as modern-day Ecuador, but maybe not Colombia. So if they weren't Inca, then it doesn't fit. So 1 or 2.

2. Teotihuacan: Mesoamerican, not Andean. 0.

3. El Tajín: Mesoamerican. 0.

4. Machu Picchu: Inca, so anti-example. 0.

5. Chichen Itza: Mesoamerican. 0.

6. Sacsayhuamán: Inca fortress, so anti-example. 0.

7. Caral: Pre-Inca, but in Peru, not defensive. 0.

8. Copán: Maya, Mesoamerican. 0.

Wait, maybe Caral is in Peru, but it's a city, not defensive. So 0.

Another thought: Pukara de Quitor is in Chile, which is part of the Andes. So the region is Andes. So any sites outside that region (like Colombia's Tairona) might still be considered Andean? Colombia is part of the Andes. So Ciudad Perdida is in the Andes but not Inca. So maybe it's a 2.

Alternatively, if the theme requires Inca incorporation, then any site not conquered by the Inca would score lower. So maybe 2 for being Andean defensive but not Inca.

Alternatively, if the theme doesn't require Inca but just defensive Andean sites, but the anti-examples include non-defensive ones. But the anti-examples include Tiwanaku (a city) which is Andean but not defensive. So the theme is defensive AND pre-Inca AND Andean, then later Inca. So the key points are: Andean, defensive, pre-Inca, then Inca.

So only sites that meet all four would get higher scores.

Ciudad Perdida: Andean, defensive? Maybe, but not Inca. So 2.

Sacsayhuamán: Inca, so 0.

Machu Picchu: Inca, 0.

Caral: not defensive, so 0.

So the highest would be 2 for Ciudad Perdida. The rest are 0 except maybe others.

Wait, what about Copán? No, it's Maya. So 0.

Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me think again.

Wait, Pukara de Quitor was used by the Incas, so the key is that the site was built before Inca and then incorporated. So the criteria are:

- Located in the Andes,

- Built by a pre-Inca Andean culture,

- Functionally defensive (fortress, puebla),

- Later incorporated into the Inca Empire.

Thus, the candidates must meet all these.

Now, check each candidate:

1. Ciudad Perdida (Teyuna): Tairona (pre-Inca, Andean). Was it incorporated into Inca? The Tairona were in northern Colombia, and the Inca expansion reached as far as modern-day Ecuador, but maybe not Colombia. So if they weren't conquered, then no. So 1 or 2.

2. Teotihuacan: Not Andean. 0.

3. El Tajín: Mesoamerican. 0.

4. Machu Picchu: Inca-built, so no. 0.

5. Chichen Itza: Mesoamerican. 0.

6. Sacsayhuamán: Inca, so 0.

7. Caral: Pre-Inca, Andean (Peru), but not defensive. 0.

8. Copán: Maya. 0.

Hmm, so only Ciudad Perdida might get 1 or 2, others 0. But maybe Sacsayhuamán is a fortress but Inca, so it's an anti-example, so 0. 

Alternatively, maybe some others have partial points? Let's see:

Caral is in Peru (Andean), but it's a city, not defensive, so 0.

El Tajín is ceremonial, so no.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a site. Let me think of Sacsayhuamán again. It is a fortress, but built by the Inca, so it's like Ollantaytambo, which is an anti-example. So 0.

So the scores would be:

1. Ciudad Perdida: 2

2. Teotihuacan: 0

3. El Tajín: 0

4. Machu Picchu: 0

5. Chichen Itza: 0

6. Sacsayhuamán: 0

7. Caral: 0

8. Copán: 0

Wait, but maybe I'm being too strict. Let me consider if any others might qualify. 

Wait, Kuelap is Chachapoya, which were conquered by the Inca. Ingapirca was Cañari-Inca, so built by Cañari then Inca. Pukara de Quitor was Quitus then Inca. So the key is the site was built by a local Andean group before Inca, then taken over.

Ciudad Perdida: If not taken by Inca, then no. But maybe the Tairona were in contact? Not sure. If unsure, maybe a 1.

Alternatively, if I consider that the examples don't require Inca incorporation, but that's not likely since the anti-examples include Inca sites. So I think the Inca part is necessary.

So the only possible non-zero is Ciudad Perdida with 2. But maybe the user expects some variation. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with Caral? No, it's way too old and not defensive.

Alternatively, perhaps Copán is in Honduras but part of Mesoamerica, so no.

Hmm, perhaps the user expects some of the candidates to score higher. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, Sacsayhuamán is a fortress but Inca, so it's like Ollantaytambo, which is an anti-example. So 0.

Machu Picchu is Inca, so 0.

Caral is not defensive, so 0.

El Tajín: Not Andean, so 0.

Teotihuacan same.

Chichen Itza same.

Copán same.

So only Ciudad Perdida gets 1 or 2. Let me go with 2.

So the scores would be:

1. 2

2. 0

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

But maybe I'm missing something else. Let me check each candidate again:

Looking at Copán: It's a Maya site in Honduras, so Mesoamerican, so 0.

El Tajín is in Mexico, so 0.

Caral is in Peru, but not defensive, so 0.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the user expects some of the candidates to have higher scores. Let me think again about the theme.

Alternative angle: The examples are all pre-Columbian sites in the Andes that are fortresses or defensive structures. The anti-examples are major cities or non-defensive structures (Tiwanaku, Chan Chan) or Inca core sites (Ollantaytambo).

So the theme is Andean defensive pre-Columbian sites, regardless of Inca incorporation. But the anti-examples include Inca sites, so maybe the theme excludes Inca sites. So the specific theme is pre-Inca Andean defensive sites.

Thus, the criteria are:

- Andean,

- Pre-Inca,

- Defensive.

In that case, the Inca incorporation part isn't required, but the anti-examples include Inca sites which would be excluded.

So revisiting:

1. Ciudad Perdida: Andean, pre-Inca, defensive? Maybe. So 6?

2. Teotihuacan: Mesoamerican, so 0.

3. El Tajín: Mesoamerican, 0.

4. Machu Picchu: Inca, so 0.

5. Chichen Itza: Mesoamerican, 0.

6. Sacsayhuamán: Inca, 0.

7. Caral: Andean, pre-Inca, but not defensive. So 3.

8. Copán: Mesoamerican, 0.

Now that's different. If the theme is just Andean defensive pre-Columbian sites (regardless of Inca), then:

Ciudad Perdida: Tairona, defensive? Maybe a city but in the mountains, so maybe defensive. 6?

Caral: Not defensive, so 3.

Sacsayhuamán is Inca, so 0.

Machu Picchu Inca, 0.

So:

1. 6

2.0

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.3

8.0

But this contradicts the anti-examples. The anti-examples include Tiwanaku (pre-Inca Andean but a city, so non-defensive). So the theme requires defensive. So Tiwanaku is an anti-example because it's a city, not defensive. So the theme is defensive AND Andean AND pre-Columbian (excluding Inca sites).

Thus:

Ciudad Perdida: defensive? Maybe a 6.

Caral: not defensive, so 1 or 2.

Sacsayhuamán: Inca, so 0.

Machu Picchu: Inca, 0.

So this way, scores are better distributed.

But I need to confirm if Ciudad Perdida is considered a fortress. Ciudad Perdida is the Tairona site, and while it's a city, it's built on a ridge and has defensive features. Maybe a 7?

Caral: no defensive structures, so 1.

Then:

1. 7

2.0

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.1

8.0

Alternatively, maybe Caral is 0 because not defensive at all.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to find some info:

Ciudad Perdida (Teyuna) is a series of terraces and plazas on a mountainside, and it's believed to have been a major center of the Tairona culture. It's in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, and its location is strategic, possibly defensive. So maybe it's defensive enough for a 6 or 7.

Caral is a city with monumental architecture but not defensive, so 0 or 1.

Sacsayhuamán is Inca, so 0.

Machu Picchu is Inca, 0.

So maybe:

1. 7

2.0

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.1

8.0

Alternatively, if Caral is considered to have some defensive aspects? Probably not.

Alternatively, maybe Copán is Mesoamerican, so 0.

Another candidate: El Tajín has ball courts and pyramids, but not defensive. So 0.

So the highest would be Ciudad Perdida at 7, Caral at 1, others 0.

But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe there are others I missed.

Wait, what about Copán? It's a Maya city, so Mesoamerican, so 0.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Teotihuacan has defensive aspects? No, it's a city.

Alternatively, maybe Machu Picchu is a fortress but Inca, so it's excluded. So 0.

Hmm. Given the examples are all in the Andes and defensive, the only candidates that fit are Ciudad Perdida and possibly Caral (if defensive) but Caral isn't. So maybe:

1. 7 (Ciudad Perdida)

2.0

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.1

8.0

But the user said to use the full range, so maybe some others have low scores.

Alternatively, perhaps El Tajín has some defensive features? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe Sacsayhuamán is a fortress but Inca, so 0.

Hmm. I think this is as close as I can get. So I'll proceed with that.
