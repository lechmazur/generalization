Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given: The Good Friday Agreement, The Treaty of Versailles, and The Dayton Agreement. Then, I have to consider the anti-examples (Treaty of Trianon, Treaty of Sèvres, Treaty of Lausanne) which don't fit the exact theme but are related in a broader sense. The task is to score each candidate on how well they fit the specific theme, not the broader ones.

Starting with the examples. The Good Friday Agreement is about resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland, a peace agreement between different political groups. The Treaty of Versailles ended WWI and redrew European borders, but it's also known for its role in post-war peace, though controversial. The Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian War, so it's another peace treaty ending a conflict. So maybe the theme is "peace agreements that ended significant conflicts, particularly involving multiple parties and leading to political settlements"?

Now the anti-examples: Treaty of Trianon (redrew Hungary's borders after WWI), Treaty of Sèvres (post-WWI division of Ottoman Empire, later replaced by Lausanne), and Treaty of Lausanne (finalized Turkey's borders). These are all treaties that redrew borders after WWI, but perhaps they are more about territorial settlements without the same level of multi-party peace process? Maybe the specific theme is more about peace processes involving internal conflicts rather than post-war territorial treaties? Or perhaps the key is that the examples are peace agreements that are more about ending civil conflicts or ethnic tensions, rather than international wars?

Looking at the examples again: Good Friday Agreement (Northern Ireland's Troubles, a civil conflict), Dayton Agreement (Bosnian War, a civil war with international involvement), Treaty of Versailles (ended a major international war, WWI). Hmm, maybe the commonality isn't just peace treaties but ones that are part of a negotiated settlement involving multiple factions, possibly ending a civil war or internal conflict rather than an international one? The Treaty of Versailles ended an international war between nations, so maybe that's a different category. Wait, but it's included as an example. So perhaps the theme is broader: major peace treaties that resolved significant conflicts, whether international or civil, through negotiated agreements?

But then why are the anti-examples excluded? The anti-examples are all post-WWI treaties. Trianon, Sèvres, Lausanne. Maybe the key is that the examples include agreements that were more about internal conflicts (Northern Ireland, Bosnia) and Versailles, which is a major international treaty, but perhaps the anti-examples are part of the same group (post-WWI treaties) but not considered part of the specific theme. Alternatively, maybe the specific theme is "peace agreements that were signed in the 20th century to resolve conflicts in Europe involving multiple parties, leading to long-term political structures"? The Treaty of Versailles is 1919, Dayton is 1995, Good Friday 1998. The anti-examples are also post-WWI (Trianon 1920, Sèvres 1920, Lausanne 1923). So maybe the specific theme isn't time-based. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are agreements that led to power-sharing or political settlements in divided societies, whereas the anti-examples are more about territorial division without the same internal political framework. For instance, the Good Friday Agreement established a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, Dayton created a framework for Bosnia's governance, and Versailles imposed terms on Germany. But Trianon similarly imposed terms on Hungary, so that might not be the distinction. 

Alternatively, the examples might be agreements that were the result of prolonged negotiations involving multiple stakeholders (including non-state actors) to end a civil conflict, whereas the anti-examples are treaties imposed by victorious nations on defeated ones, without the same level of negotiation with the conflicting parties. The Treaty of Versailles was imposed on Germany by the Allies, so maybe that's part of the theme, but the anti-examples are similar? Hmm, that might not fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps the specific theme is agreements that ended ethnic or sectarian conflicts through power-sharing or partition, such as Northern Ireland (Catholics vs. Protestants), Bosnia (Serbs, Croats, Bosniaks), and maybe Versailles? Wait, Versailles ended a world war, not an ethnic conflict. Maybe Versailles is an outlier here. Alternatively, maybe the theme is agreements that were significant in shaping modern geopolitical boundaries, but that might be too broad. 

Wait, the anti-examples are all post-WWI treaties, so maybe the specific theme is not about post-WWI treaties, but the examples include Versailles which is post-WWI. So perhaps the theme is not time-based. Let me think again. 

Looking at the three examples: Good Friday (1998), Dayton (1995), Versailles (1919). The anti-examples are all post-WWI treaties (Trianon, Sèvres, Lausanne). So maybe the specific theme is agreements that ended major conflicts in Europe, but not all post-WWI treaties. Or perhaps the key is that the examples are peace agreements that were followed by some form of international oversight or monitoring, like the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia (Dayton), or the power-sharing mechanisms in Northern Ireland. The Treaty of Versailles led to the League of Nations, but maybe that's part of it. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples are agreements that were signed in the 20th century to end wars that involved the United States, but that's not the case. The Good Friday Agreement involved the UK and Ireland, Dayton had US involvement, Versailles had many countries. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is agreements that are considered landmark peace agreements in their regions, with lasting impact. The anti-examples are also landmark treaties but perhaps more controversial or not as successful in the long term? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the examples are agreements that ended civil wars or internal conflicts, while the anti-examples are treaties that ended international wars. The Treaty of Versailles ended WWI (international), but maybe it's included because it's a major peace treaty. That doesn't fit. 

Wait, maybe the specific theme is agreements that were signed after a significant conflict and established a new political framework, but not necessarily all post-war treaties. The Treaty of Versailles did impose terms on Germany, leading to its political restructuring. The Dayton Agreement established a constitution for Bosnia. The Good Friday Agreement created a power-sharing government. The anti-examples like Trianon redrew borders but perhaps didn't establish a new political framework for the involved parties. 

Alternatively, the anti-examples are treaties that were superseded or replaced (like Sèvres by Lausanne), but that might not be the key. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that involved multiple parties sitting at the table, negotiating a settlement, whereas the anti-examples were imposed on the defeated party without their full participation. For instance, the Treaty of Versailles was imposed on Germany, but perhaps the process involved more negotiation than the anti-examples? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the specific theme is agreements that ended wars in the Balkans, but that can't be since Versailles is not in the Balkans. 

Hmm. Maybe the key is that the examples are peace agreements that are considered successful or have had long-term effects, whereas the anti-examples are treaties that led to further conflict or were not as effective. The Treaty of Versailles is often criticized for contributing to WWII, but it's still an example here. The Treaty of Lausanne is considered more successful in stabilizing Turkey. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples are agreements that were multilateral and involved international mediation, whereas the anti-examples are bilateral? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that ended conflicts in regions with complex ethnic or sectarian divides, leading to power-sharing or partition, whereas the anti-examples are more about territorial division without such internal governance structures. 

For example, the Good Friday Agreement dealt with sectarian divisions between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland, leading to a power-sharing government. The Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian War, which was an ethnic conflict between Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks, and established a complex governing structure. The Treaty of Versailles ended WWI, which was an international conflict between nations, but perhaps the key here is that it's a major peace treaty, not necessarily about internal divisions. 

Wait, but if that's the case, why are the anti-examples excluded? The Treaty of Trianon ended the war with Hungary, but it was part of the post-WWI treaties that redrew borders. The Treaty of Lausanne ended the Greco-Turkish War and established Turkey's borders. So maybe the specific theme is not about internal vs. international conflicts, but something else. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that were signed in the 20th century (except maybe the Treaty of Versailles is 1919, which is early 20th), and the anti-examples are also in that period. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are agreements that were the result of intensive diplomatic efforts, perhaps with a specific mediator. The Dayton Agreement was brokered by the US, Good Friday by the British and Irish governments, and Versailles by the Allied powers. The anti-examples might have been more of a straightforward imposition. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that led to the creation of new states or entities. The Dayton Agreement established the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the Good Friday Agreement kept Northern Ireland within the UK but with a power-sharing government. The Treaty of Versailles led to the creation of new states in Europe. The anti-examples like Trianon reduced Hungary's territory, but didn't create new states as much as redrew borders. 

Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the specific theme is agreements that were signed after a conflict to establish a lasting peace, often with international guarantees, while the anti-examples are treaties that were more punitive or led to subsequent conflicts. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples are agreements that are considered 'peace processes' involving multiple factions within a country, while the anti-examples are treaties between countries. 

Wait, the Treaty of Versailles was between countries, but it ended an international war, so maybe that's not it. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that have a name that's not just a treaty but includes a location (like Dayton Agreement, Good Friday Agreement) whereas the anti-examples are just treaties named after locations. But that's a superficial distinction. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that involved non-state actors as signatories, like political parties or rebel groups, while the anti-examples were between states. For example, the Good Friday Agreement involved Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionists, while the Dayton Agreement involved the Bosnian government, Bosnian Serbs, and Croats. The Treaty of Versailles was between states. The anti-examples like Trianon were between states (Hungary and Allies). 

Ah! This might be it. The specific theme could be "peace agreements that involve internal factions or non-state actors as signatories, ending an internal conflict, rather than being treaties between sovereign states following an international war." 

In that case, the Treaty of Versailles is an outlier here because it was between states, but maybe the user included it as an example despite that, so perhaps my assumption is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are agreements that ended civil wars or ethnic conflicts within a country, while the anti-examples are treaties between countries after a world war. 

Wait, the Treaty of Versailles ended WWI, an international war between countries. The Dayton Agreement ended the Bosnian War, an internal conflict with international involvement. The Good Friday Agreement ended the Troubles in Northern Ireland, an internal conflict. 

So perhaps the theme is agreements that ended civil wars or internal conflicts (even if with international mediation), whereas the anti-examples are treaties that ended international wars (WWI). 

If that's the case, then the scoring would be based on whether the candidate agreements ended internal conflicts vs. international ones. 

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Treaty of Paris (1783): Ended the American Revolutionary War between the US and Britain. That's an international conflict, so would be an anti-example. So score low.

2. Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine: Post-WWI treaty with Bulgaria. Part of the same group as the anti-examples (post-WWI, international), so low.

3. Treaty of Riga (1921): Ended the Polish-Soviet War. That's an international conflict between Poland and the USSR. So anti-example, low.

4. Congress of Vienna (1815): A conference that reorganized Europe after Napoleon. Not a treaty ending a civil war, so not matching. Low.

5. Camp David Accords (1978): Between Egypt and Israel, ending their conflict over Sinai. International conflict, but perhaps seen as a peace agreement between two states. So maybe mid-range? But since the examples include Versailles (international), maybe this is acceptable. Hmm.

6. Treaty of San Francisco (1951): Ended WWII with Japan. International, so anti-example. Low.

7. Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (1918): Between Germany and Russia, ending part of WWI. International, so anti-example. Low.

8. Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919): Post-WWI treaty with Austria. Like the anti-examples, so low.

Wait, but the Treaty of Versailles is an example but it's international. So maybe the key isn't internal vs. international. Then perhaps another angle. 

Alternative approach: The examples are all agreements that are considered significant in resolving long-standing or complex conflicts through negotiation, with lasting impact. The anti-examples are also significant but perhaps seen as more punitive or leading to further conflict. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that involved the United States as a mediator or signatory. The Dayton Agreement was brokered by the US, Good Friday involved UK/Ireland, and Versailles had US involvement. The anti-examples (Trianon, Sèvres, Lausanne) were European treaties without US involvement? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the examples are all agreements that are still in effect today, while the anti-examples were replaced or became obsolete. The Treaty of Sèvres was replaced by Lausanne, but that's still in effect. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to think of another angle. 

Looking at the anti-examples: Trianon, Sèvres, Lausanne. All are post-WWI treaties except Lausanne (post-WWI but also ended the Greco-Turkish War). The examples include Versailles (post-WWI), so maybe the theme isn't about post-WWI. 

Wait, the Treaty of Lausanne is an anti-example but it's also a major peace treaty. Maybe the key is that the examples are agreements that were signed to end civil or ethnic conflicts within a country's borders, while the anti-examples are about redrawing international borders after a world war. 

So, for instance, the Good Friday Agreement dealt with internal conflict in Northern Ireland, Dayton with Bosnia's internal factions, and Versailles... Hmm, Versailles was about ending an international war, so maybe it's an exception. Alternatively, maybe the theme is agreements that have a constitutional or governance aspect. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that are considered to have established a new political order, while the anti-examples are more about territorial adjustments. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is agreements that were the result of prolonged negotiations involving multiple parties, including non-state actors, to resolve a conflict, whereas the anti-examples were imposed by the victors without such negotiations. 

For example, the Treaty of Versailles was imposed on Germany, but the process involved some negotiation. Not sure. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that are named after locations where the negotiations took place (Dayton, Good Friday in Belfast, Versailles), but that's superficial. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that have a lasting impact on the region's stability, whereas the anti-examples led to further instability. 

The Treaty of Versailles is often criticized for contributing to WWII, but it's still considered a major peace agreement. 

This is challenging. Maybe I should proceed with the best hypothesis I have and apply it. 

Assuming the theme is agreements that ended civil wars or internal conflicts through negotiated settlements involving multiple factions, leading to a power-sharing or federal structure, then:

- The Treaty of Paris (1783): Ends American Revolution (international), so low score.
- Treaty of Neuilly: Post-WWI, international, low.
- Treaty of Riga: International between Poland and USSR, low.
- Congress of Vienna: Not a treaty ending a civil war, low.
- Camp David Accords: Between Egypt and Israel (international), but it's a peace treaty between two states. Since Versailles is an example which is international, maybe this counts. Maybe mid-range (like 5 or 6).
- Treaty of San Francisco: Ends WWII with Japan (international), low.
- Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: International treaty, low.
- Treaty of Saint-Germain: Post-WWI, low.

But the problem is that Versailles is an example, which is an international treaty. So maybe the key is not internal vs. international. 

Alternative angle: The examples are all agreements that are considered to be "peace agreements" rather than "treaties of surrender". The anti-examples might be seen as more punitive. 

The Treaty of Versailles is punitive, but it's an example here, so that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that established new political frameworks or entities, whereas the anti-examples just redrew borders. 

Dayton created a new government structure for Bosnia. Good Friday created a power-sharing government. Versailles imposed terms on Germany but didn't create a new entity. Hmm, so maybe not. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that have a name that's not just the location (like Good Friday Agreement) whereas the anti-examples are just location-based. Not sure. 

Another approach: Let's see the anti-examples. Trianon, Sèvres, Lausanne are all treaties that were part of the post-WWI settlement, specifically dealing with the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires. The examples include Versailles (post-WWI) but also more modern agreements. 

Perhaps the specific theme is agreements that are multilateral and involve multiple parties, including non-state actors, to resolve a conflict, whereas the anti-examples are bilateral treaties between states. 

The Treaty of Versailles was a multilateral treaty with many signatories. The Dayton Agreement involved multiple parties (Bosnian government, Bosnian Serbs, Croats, and international actors). The Good Friday Agreement involved various political groups in Northern Ireland. 

The anti-examples like Trianon were between Hungary and the Allies (multiple states, so multilateral?), but maybe they didn't involve the internal factions of the defeated country. 

Alternatively, the key is that the examples are agreements that led to lasting peace, while the anti-examples are treaties that led to further conflict. 

Treaty of Versailles is seen as leading to WWII, but it's an example here. 

Hmm. This is really tough. Maybe I should try to assign scores based on how much they resemble the examples in terms of being peace agreements ending conflicts, even if international, versus the anti-examples which are post-WWI treaties. 

The examples include Versailles (post-WWI), so the anti-examples must differ in another way. The anti-examples are all treaties that were part of the same group (post-WWI) but maybe not as comprehensive or leading to as much internal political restructuring. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that are still in effect and have been successful, while the anti-examples have been replaced or led to new conflicts. 

The Treaty of Sèvres was replaced by Lausanne, which is also an anti-example. Trianon's terms were softened over time. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that were signed in the 20th century (except maybe Versailles is early 20th), but the candidates include older treaties like the Treaty of Paris (1783). 

Perhaps the key is that the examples are agreements that are considered landmark peace agreements in their regions, while the anti-examples are more about territorial division without such significance. 

Alternatively, the examples include agreements that were the result of US mediation (Dayton, Good Friday had US involvement indirectly, Versailles had US participation). 

The Camp David Accords were brokered by the US, so that might score higher. 

Let's try to assign scores based on how much they resemble the examples (peace agreements ending significant conflicts, often involving international mediation):

1. Treaty of Paris (1783): Ends American Revolution. Major international treaty, similar to Versailles but older. Maybe a 6? Since it's a major peace treaty but not a civil conflict.

2. Treaty of Neuilly: Post-WWI, similar to anti-examples. 2.

3. Treaty of Riga: Ends a major war between Poland and Soviet Russia. 4? It's a peace treaty but between states.

4. Congress of Vienna: Not a treaty but a conference. 0 or 1. Maybe 1, since it's a diplomatic event leading to treaties.

5. Camp David: Between Egypt and Israel, major peace agreement. 8? Since it's a notable peace treaty between states, similar to Versailles but more recent and successful.

6. Treaty of San Francisco: Ends WWII with Japan. Major, but similar to Versailles. 7?

7. Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: WWI treaty, imposed on Russia. 3.

8. Treaty of Saint-Germain: Post-WWI with Austria. 2.

Wait, but the user said not to use just 0s and 10s, so spread out. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, considering that the examples include Versailles (which is a major international treaty), the theme might just be major peace treaties that ended significant conflicts, regardless of being internal or international. The anti-examples are also post-WWI treaties, so perhaps the specific theme is not post-WWI treaties, but the examples include one, so the anti-examples must be different in another way. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that are still in force today, whereas the anti-examples have been modified or are no longer the primary framework. For example, the Treaty of Trianon's terms were softened by later agreements, but the original is still a treaty. Not sure. 

Alternatively, the examples are agreements that are considered to have resolved the conflict they were addressing, whereas the anti-examples led to further conflicts. 

The Treaty of Versailles is often blamed for causing WWII, so that would be a bad example, but it's listed as an example. So that can't be. 

Hmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the best approach is to consider that the examples are agreements that ended wars in Europe involving complex negotiations (even if international), while the anti-examples are part of the same group (post-WWI) but perhaps more punitive or less negotiated. 

Assigning scores based on how much they resemble the examples (peace treaties ending major conflicts, often involving significant negotiation):

1. Treaty of Paris (1783): Major international peace treaty. 8? Since it's a foundational treaty but not a civil conflict.

2. Treaty of Neuilly: Post-WWI, similar to anti-examples. 2.

3. Treaty of Riga: Ends a major war between states. 5.

4. Congress of Vienna: Not a treaty but a conference. 0.

5. Camp David: Major peace between Egypt and Israel. 9?

6. Treaty of San Francisco: Ends WWII with Japan. 7.

7. Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: WWI, imposed on Russia. 3.

8. Treaty of Saint-Germain: Post-WWI with Austria. 2.

Wait, but the user said to use the full range from 0-10. Maybe adjust:

1. Paris 1783: 7 (major peace treaty, international).

2. Neuilly: 2.

3. Riga: 4.

4. Congress of Vienna: 1 (since it's a process leading to treaties).

5. Camp David: 9 (successful, modern).

6. San Francisco: 8 (significant, international).

7. Brest-Litovsk: 3.

8. Saint-Germain: 2.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the Camp David Accords are more like the examples since they involve resolving a long-standing conflict through negotiation. The Treaty of Versailles is included even though it's international, so maybe international treaties are okay as long as they're major peace agreements. 

Alternatively, the examples include both international and internal conflicts, so the theme is just major peace agreements. The anti-examples are post-WWI treaties but perhaps less impactful or more punitive. 

In that case, the candidates:

1. Treaty of Paris (1783): Major, so 8.

2. Neuilly: Post-WWI, similar to anti-examples (which are also post-WWI), so maybe 3.

3. Riga: Ends a major war, 5.

4. Congress of Vienna: Not a treaty, 0.

5. Camp David: 9.

6. San Francisco: 8.

7. Brest-Litovsk: 3 (WWI, imposed).

8. Saint-Germain: 3 (post-WWI).

But since the anti-examples are post-WWI treaties, the candidates that are also post-WWI (Neuilly, Riga, Saint-Germain) would be lower. Brest-Litovsk is also WWI but pre-Versailles. 

Alternatively, the specific theme excludes post-WWI treaties except Versailles. Since the anti-examples are all post-WWI except Lausanne (which is post-WWI too), maybe the theme is not that. 

I think I'll proceed with the scores as follows, considering that the examples include Versailles (a major post-WWI treaty), so the anti-examples must differ in another way. Maybe the anti-examples are treaties that were imposed without the defeated party's meaningful participation, while the examples involved more negotiation. 

Thus:

1. Treaty of Paris (1783): Negotiated end to the Revolutionary War. 7.

2. Neuilly: Imposed on Bulgaria, 2.

3. Riga: Negotiated between Poland and Soviets, 5.

4. Congress of Vienna: Not a treaty, 1.

5. Camp David: Negotiated, 9.

6. San Francisco: Negotiated with Japan, 8.

7. Brest-Litovsk: Imposed on Russia, 3.

8. Saint-Germain: Imposed on Austria, 2.

This seems reasonable. Final scores:

1. 7

2. 2

3. 5

4. 1

5. 9

6. 8

7. 3

8. 2
