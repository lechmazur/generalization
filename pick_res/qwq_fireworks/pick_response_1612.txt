Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples provided are the Hoover Dam, Manhattan Project, and Golden Gate Bridge. Each of these projects required advancements in specific scientific or engineering methods. 

The Hoover Dam needed advancements in concrete strength testing and structural analysis. The Manhattan Project involved new statistical methods for nuclear reactions and material analysis. The Golden Gate Bridge required innovations in aerodynamic modeling and suspension cable calculations. So the common theme here seems to be large-scale engineering or scientific projects that directly necessitated the creation of new methodologies or technologies in specific technical fields to solve critical challenges in their construction or execution.

Now, the anti-examples are the first nuclear reactors, Brooklyn Bridge, and Channel Tunnel. The Brooklyn Bridge and Channel Tunnel are big projects, but maybe they didn't require as groundbreaking or as specific methodological advancements as the examples. The first nuclear reactors might be part of the Manhattan Project but perhaps too general or part of a broader category. So the key is that the specific theme is about projects where the project itself drove the creation of entirely new analytical or technical methods in their respective fields.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **First electric power grid**: The creation of the first electric grid (like Edison's system) would require new engineering methods for power distribution, voltage regulation, etc. But I'm not sure if it's as significant in terms of new methodologies as the examples. Maybe a 5 or 6? But compared to the examples which had very specific innovations (concrete testing, statistical methods for nuclear, aerodynamic modeling), maybe it's a bit less. Hmm.

2. **First computers**: The invention of the first computers (like ENIAC or earlier) was driven by needs like ballistics calculations or code-breaking (Manhattan Project maybe?), but the computers themselves were a result of needing to solve complex computations. However, the computers themselves are a tool, so does the project of creating them count as requiring new methodologies? Or is it the other way around? Maybe a 7 or 8? Since they were developed to handle specific calculations (like for the Manhattan Project), but the project here is the invention of computers. Not sure.

3. **Eiffel Tower**: The Eiffel Tower's construction involved new engineering techniques, especially in iron construction and wind resistance. But compared to the Golden Gate Bridge's suspension cables and aerodynamics, maybe it's similar. However, the anti-example is the Brooklyn Bridge, which is a suspension bridge, so maybe the Eiffel Tower is more about structural innovation but perhaps not as methodological? The examples all involved specific analytical methods. The Eiffel Tower might have used new structural analysis, so maybe a 6 or 7? But need to compare.

4. **Transcontinental Railroad**: This required significant engineering feats like bridging canyons, tunneling through mountains, but I'm not sure if it necessitated new analytical methods. More about logistics and existing engineering scaled up. So maybe a lower score, like 3 or 4.

5. **London Underground**: The first subway system. It involved tunneling, but again, maybe more about adapting existing methods rather than creating new ones. Perhaps a 2 or 3.

6. **First space rockets**: Developing rockets for space required new materials, propulsion methods, and computational models. The Saturn V and early rockets needed innovations in aerodynamics, fuel systems, and guidance. This seems closer. Maybe a 8 or 9? Since it's a big project requiring new methodologies.

7. **First skyscrapers**: Skyscrapers needed steel frames, elevators, and new structural designs. The Home Insurance Building used a steel frame, which was a key innovation. So structural engineering advancements. This might be similar to the Eiffel Tower. Maybe a 6 or 7.

8. **Panama Canal**: The description here says it necessitated new methods for calculating water flow and soil stability. Wait, the user included this as an anti-example? Wait no, the anti-examples were the Channel Tunnel, etc. Wait, the Panama Canal is actually one of the candidates (number 8), and the user's anti-examples don't include it. Wait the user's anti-examples were the first nuclear reactors, Brooklyn Bridge, and Channel Tunnel. The Panama Canal is a candidate here, and the user's example for the candidate 8 includes the Panama Canal with the note about new methods. Wait, looking back, the candidate 8 is the Panama Canal, and the user's own example for that candidate says "which necessitated new methods for calculating water flow and soil stability." That sounds exactly like the examples given (Hoover Dam, Manhattan, Golden Gate). So that should be a high score, like 10. Wait but the user's anti-examples don't include Panama, so maybe that's a good match. So candidate 8 would be a 10? But wait, the user's own examples included Hoover Dam, which is similar to Panama in needing engineering methods. So Panama would fit the theme perfectly. So maybe 10.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to not output the theme, so I have to proceed based on the examples given. Let me check again.

Wait the user's anti-examples are the creation of the first nuclear reactors (which might be part of Manhattan Project but maybe not the project itself, but the reactors), the Brooklyn Bridge (which is a suspension bridge, similar to Golden Gate but perhaps without the same methodological innovations?), and the Channel Tunnel (maybe they used existing methods but on a larger scale). So Panama Canal, as candidate 8, which the user describes with the exact same phrasing as the examples, should get a 10. But the user's examples didn't include it, but the candidate's description is as per the theme. So yes, 10.

Wait but in the problem statement, the user provided the candidates, and for candidate 8, the user included the note about new methods, just like the examples. So that's a perfect match. So 10.

But let me recheck each candidate step by step again carefully.

1. First electric power grid: The creation of the grid would require things like figuring out AC vs DC, transformers, distribution networks. Maybe new methodologies in electrical engineering, but perhaps not as groundbreaking as the examples. Maybe 5 or 6.

2. First computers: The first computers like ENIAC were built to solve complex calculations (e.g., artillery trajectories), which required new computational methods. Since the project (building the computer) necessitated new ways of handling calculations, this might fit. So 8 or 9?

3. Eiffel Tower: The tower's construction involved innovative use of wrought iron, and Gustave Eiffel used new calculations for wind resistance and structural analysis. So similar to the Golden Gate's aerodynamic modeling. Maybe 8? But the anti-example is the Brooklyn Bridge, which is a suspension bridge. The Eiffel Tower's innovations might be more about material use and structural analysis, so maybe 7 or 8.

4. Transcontinental Railroad: This was a massive project, but the main challenges were logistical (spanning the continent, dealing with terrain, financing). The technology used was existing (steam engines, tracks), maybe some tunneling and bridge techniques but not necessarily new analytical methods. So maybe 3 or 4.

5. London Underground: The first underground railways, required tunneling under cities, maybe new methods for tunneling, but perhaps more about adapting existing mining techniques. So maybe 2 or 3.

6. First space rockets: Development of rockets like V-2, then later ones for spaceflight. This required new materials (heat shields, fuels), propulsion engineering, and computational models for trajectories. Definitely needed new methods. So maybe 9.

7. First skyscrapers: The use of steel frames allowed for taller buildings. The Home Insurance Building used a steel skeleton, which was a new method. So structural engineering advancements. This might be similar to the Eiffel Tower. Maybe 7.

8. Panama Canal: The description explicitly mentions new methods for water flow and soil stability. This matches exactly the examples given, so 10.

Wait but let me check the user's examples again. The examples all have projects that required specific new methodologies (concrete testing, statistical methods, aerodynamic modeling). The Panama Canal's candidate description includes exactly that, so it's a perfect 10.

Now, let's assign scores:

1. Electric grid: Maybe 5. It's a major project but perhaps not as focused on creating new analytical methods. The grid's development involved figuring out distribution systems, which might be more about application than new methodologies. So 5.

2. First computers: The invention of the first computers (like Babbage's Analytical Engine, or ENIAC) was driven by the need for computation. The project of creating them would require new methods in computation and engineering. Since ENIAC was for ballistics calculations (similar to Manhattan's need for computations), maybe 9.

3. Eiffel Tower: 7 or 8. Since it involved structural analysis and wind resistance, which are analytical methods. Let's say 8.

4. Transcontinental Railroad: 3.

5. London Underground: 2.

6. Space rockets: 9.

7. Skyscrapers: 7.

8. Panama Canal: 10.

Wait but let me adjust for nuances. The Panama Canal is a direct hit, so 10. The Eiffel Tower might be 7 because while it had innovations, maybe not as systematized as the examples. The computers (ENIAC) were part of the Manhattan Project's work, so maybe the project of creating the first computers is part of a larger theme but here the candidate is about the computers themselves. Since the Manhattan Project is an example, the computers' development as a separate project might be a 9.

Alternatively, maybe the first computers (like Babbage's engine) were not tied to a specific project, but the first electronic computers were tied to military projects. So if the candidate is about the invention of computers as a project, then it's similar to the Manhattan's need for new statistical methods. So maybe 9.

The skyscrapers: The steel frame was a new method, so 7.

So final scores:

1. 5

2. 9

3. 8

4. 3

5. 2

6. 9

7. 7

8. 10

Wait but let's see if any of these need adjustment. The first electric grid: The creation of the first grid (like Edison's in NYC) involved figuring out how to distribute electricity efficiently, maybe developing new distribution networks and voltage regulation techniques. But is that a new analytical method or more of an application? Maybe 6.

The Panama Canal is definitely 10.

The Eiffel Tower's structural analysis and wind resistance calculations would be similar to the Golden Gate's aerodynamic modeling, so 8.

Transcontinental railroad: Maybe 4? Since it required some engineering but not necessarily new methods. Maybe 3 or 4. Let's say 4.

London Underground: 2.

Space rockets: 9.

Skyscrapers: 7.

First computers: 9.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the first electric grid could be 6. Let me adjust:

1. 6

2. 9

3. 8

4. 4

5. 2

6. 9

7. 7

8. 10

That seems better. The first electric grid gets a 6, the Transcontinental Railroad a 4. The others as before.

I think that's a reasonable spread, using the full range from 2 to 10.
