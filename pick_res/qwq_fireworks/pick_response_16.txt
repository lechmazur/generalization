Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided three examples: Miami Circle, Majorville Medicine Wheel, and Bighorn Medicine Wheel. Then there are three anti-examples: Callanish Stones, Ring of Brodgar, and Avebury. The task is to score eight candidates on how well they fit the specific theme of the examples without matching the broader or related themes of the anti-examples.

First, I need to figure out what the common theme is among the examples. Let me recall each of them:

- **Miami Circle**: This is a prehistoric site in Florida, characterized by a circular arrangement of holes in oolitic limestone. It's associated with the Tequesta people and might have had ceremonial or astronomical purposes.

- **Majorville Medicine Wheel** and **Bighorn Medicine Wheel**: These are both medicine wheels, which are stone structures built by Indigenous peoples of North America. Medicine wheels typically have a central cairn of stones surrounded by spokes radiating outward, often aligned with astronomical events. They're used for ceremonial, astronomical, and spiritual purposes.

Looking at these examples, the common elements seem to be:
1. **North American origin**: All are located in North America (Miami in the US, Majorville and Bighorn in Canada and the US, respectively).
2. **Indigenous construction**: Built by Indigenous peoples (Tequesta, Plains Indigenous groups).
3. **Circular or wheel-like structures**: The Miami Circle is a circular arrangement, while the medicine wheels are explicitly wheel-shaped with spokes.
4. **Astronomical or ceremonial purposes**: Likely used for astronomical observations or rituals.

Now the anti-examples are Callanish Stones, Ring of Brodgar, and Avebury. These are all Neolithic and Bronze Age sites in the British Isles. They are megalithic monuments, part of the broader category of European megalithic structures. They are also circular or arranged in circles, and some have astronomical alignments. However, they are not Indigenous North American sites. The key difference here is the geographical and cultural origin: European vs. North American Indigenous.

So the specific theme is likely **"North American Indigenous circular or wheel-like structures with ceremonial/astronomical purposes"**. The anti-examples are similar in structure (circular, megalithic) but are European, so they don't fit the specific theme.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Rollright Stones (UK)**: These are Neolithic and Bronze Age standing stones in England. They are European megaliths, similar to the anti-examples. So they don't fit the North American Indigenous theme. Score: 0 or 1, but since they are stone circles but not Indigenous NA, maybe 1?

Wait, but the anti-examples include Callanish (Scotland), Ring of Brodgar (Scotland), Avebury (England). So Rollright is another UK site, so definitely an anti-example. So 0.

2. **Newark Earthworks (US)**: This is a Hopewell culture site in Ohio. The Hopewell were Indigenous North Americans. The earthworks include large geometric enclosures, including circles and octagons. They have astronomical alignments. This fits the theme perfectly. Score: 10?

Wait, but maybe not a wheel exactly. The medicine wheels are specifically wheels with spokes. Newark Earthworks are more geometric earthworks. Hmm. But they are NA Indigenous, ceremonial/astronomical. Maybe a 9 or 8? Let me think. The examples include Miami (circle), and medicine wheels (wheels). Newark is a big ceremonial site with circles, so maybe 9?

3. **Serpent Mound (US)**: A effigy mound in Ohio, also Hopewell culture. It's a serpent-shaped earthwork. While it's Indigenous NA and ceremonial, it's not a circular or wheel structure. So maybe lower. But it's still a significant ceremonial site. Maybe 5? Because it's related but not exactly the structure type.

4. **Stonehenge (UK)**: A famous Neolithic/Bronze Age site in England. Definitely European, so like the anti-examples. Score: 0.

5. **Woodhenge (England)**: Another UK site, part of the Durrington Walls complex near Stonehenge. It's a timber circle. Again, European, so 0.

6. **Newgrange (Ireland)**: A Neolithic passage tomb, part of the Bru na Boinne complex. Again, European, so 0.

7. **Cahokia Woodhenge (US)**: This is a series of wooden posts in the shape of circles at the Cahokia Mounds site in Illinois, a major Mississippian culture site. The woodhenge was used for astronomical purposes. This is Indigenous NA and a circular structure, so fits well. Maybe 10? Or similar to Newark. Since Cahokia is Mississippian, and the woodhenge is a direct circular structure with astronomical purpose, this is a strong candidate. Maybe 10?

Wait, but the examples include medicine wheels which have spokes, while Cahokia Woodhenge is a circle of posts. Maybe slightly different structure but still fits the theme. So maybe 10.

8. **Carnac stones (France)**: A large collection of Neolithic menhirs in France. European again, so 0.

Wait, but let me go through each again carefully.

1. Rollright Stones: European, so 0.

2. Newark Earthworks: NA Indigenous, ceremonial, includes circles. 10?

But maybe the medicine wheels are more specifically wheel-like with spokes. Newark's octagons and circles are more complex but still fit the broader category. Since the examples include Miami (circle) and medicine wheels (spoked), Newark is a good fit. 10.

3. Serpent Mound: Not a circle or wheel, but an effigy. Still ceremonial, but structure different. Maybe 4? Since it's not the shape but shares cultural and purpose aspects.

4. Stonehenge: 0.

5. Woodhenge (England): 0.

6. Newgrange: 0.

7. Cahokia Woodhenge: 10.

8. Carnac stones: 0.

Wait, but maybe some of the candidates have nuances. For instance, the Bighorn Medicine Wheel is a specific type with spokes, so maybe the key is the wheel structure. Then Newark Earthworks are more geometric but not wheels. Cahokia Woodhenge is a circle of posts, so similar to Woodhenge in England but NA. So maybe Cahokia is 10, Newark 8?

Alternatively, the Miami Circle is a circle without spokes, so circles are acceptable. So Newark's circles would be okay. So maybe 10 for Newark and Cahokia.

Wait, the user said the examples include Miami (circle), Majorville and Bighorn (medicine wheels). So the theme includes both circles and medicine wheels. Thus, any NA Indigenous circular or wheel structures with ceremonial/astronomical purposes.

Cahokia Woodhenge is a circle, so 10.

Serpent Mound is an effigy, not circular, so lower. Maybe 3.

Newark Earthworks have circles and octagons, so 10.

Wait but maybe the medicine wheels are a specific type, but the theme is broader: any NA Indigenous circular or wheel-like structures with that purpose. So Newark and Cahokia fit. The anti-examples are European, so any European sites get 0.

Now, let's check each candidate again:

1. Rollright Stones (UK) – 0.

2. Newark Earthworks – 10.

3. Serpent Mound – 4 (ceremonial but not circular/wheel).

4. Stonehenge – 0.

5. Woodhenge (England) – 0.

6. Newgrange – 0.

7. Cahokia Woodhenge – 10.

8. Carnac – 0.

Wait, but the user wants scores from 0-10, nuanced. Maybe some are in between.

Wait, the examples include Miami Circle (a circle with holes in limestone), and the medicine wheels (spoked wheels). So the key is the structure being a circle or wheel made by Indigenous NA for ceremonial/astronomical purposes.

Serpent Mound is a mound in the shape of a serpent, not a circle or wheel, so lower score. Maybe 2.

Cahokia Woodhenge is a wooden circle with astronomical purpose, so 10.

Newark Earthworks have multiple circles and octagons, so 10.

Rollright, Stonehenge, Woodhenge (England), Newgrange, Carnac are all European, so 0.

What about the others?

Wait, candidate 5 is Woodhenge in England, so 0.

Candidate 6 is Newgrange, a tomb, but in Ireland, so 0.

Candidate 3: Serpent Mound is Hopewell, so same culture as Newark, but different structure. Since the examples include both circles and wheels, but Serpent Mound is an effigy, maybe 3.

Candidate 7: Cahokia Woodhenge is a circle of posts, so matches the structure type of Miami (circle) and the medicine wheels (wheel-like). So 10.

Thus, the scores would be:

1. 0

2. 10

3. 3

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 10

8. 0

But wait, the user said to use the full range. Maybe some should be in between. Let me think again.

Wait, the anti-examples are similar in structure (circular) but European. The key is being NA Indigenous and the structure type (circle/wheel).

Serpent Mound is NA Indigenous but not a circle/wheel. So maybe 2 or 3.

Cahokia Woodhenge is a circle, so 10.

Newark Earthworks includes circles and other shapes, so 10.

Are there any candidates that are partially matching but not fully? For example, maybe the Woodhenge in England is a woodhenge but in Europe, so 0. The user wants to exclude those.

Another thought: The examples include Miami Circle (a circle), and the medicine wheels (wheels). The theme could be "North American Indigenous ceremonial structures that are circular or wheel-shaped". So any NA Indigenous site that is a circle or wheel shape for ceremony/astronomy.

Thus:

- Newark Earthworks: circles and octagons, so yes. 10.

- Cahokia Woodhenge: circle, yes. 10.

- Serpent Mound: not circular, so low. Maybe 2.

- The rest (European) 0.

But maybe the user expects some candidates to be in the middle. Let me check the candidates again.

Wait, candidate 5: Woodhenge (England) – that's a woodhenge in the UK, so same as the anti-examples. So 0.

Candidate 7: Cahokia is definitely a good match. 10.

Candidate 3: Serpent Mound is a significant site but not circular. So 2 or 3.

Candidate 2: Newark Earthworks are huge and include circles, so 10.

Thus, the scores would be as above. But the user wants nuanced scores, so maybe some are 8 or 9 instead of 10?

Alternatively, perhaps the medicine wheels are more specific (spoked), so Newark's octagons might be a bit different. Maybe Newark gets 9 and Cahokia 10? Or vice versa.

Alternatively, the Miami Circle is a simple circle, while the medicine wheels are more complex (spoked). So maybe the key is that they are all "medicine wheels or similar Indigenous circular structures". But the examples include both types, so perhaps any NA circular ceremonial site is okay.

Alternatively, maybe "medicine wheel" is the key term here. The examples are two medicine wheels and Miami Circle. The anti-examples are European stone circles. So the theme is "medicine wheels and related NA Indigenous circular sites".

In that case, the medicine wheels are the main examples, but Miami Circle is also included. So perhaps the key is "North American Indigenous ceremonial circles or wheels".

Cahokia Woodhenge is a circle, so 10.

Newark Earthworks has circles, so 10.

Serpent Mound: not a circle, so 2.

Thus, I think the scores are as I had before. But let me check if there are any other nuances.

Another angle: The Miami Circle is a pre-Columbian site with a specific feature (holes in limestone), while the medicine wheels are stone arrangements. So maybe the theme is "North American Indigenous stone or earthwork circles/wheels with ceremonial/astronomical purposes".

In that case, Serpent Mound is an earthwork but not a circle, so still low.

Cahokia Woodhenge is a wooden circle, but still NA Indigenous and ceremonial. So yes.

So I think the scores are:

1. Rollright Stones: 0

2. Newark Earthworks: 10

3. Serpent Mound: 3

4. Stonehenge: 0

5. Woodhenge (England): 0

6. Newgrange: 0

7. Cahokia Woodhenge: 10

8. Carnac stones: 0

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be as per the format. Let me make sure I didn't miss any candidates. Let's list them again:

Candidates:
1. Rollright Stones → 0

2. Newark Earthworks →10

3. Serpent Mound →3

4. Stonehenge →0

5. Woodhenge (England) →0

6. Newgrange →0

7. Cahokia Woodhenge →10

8. Carnac stones →0

But the user requires the scores to use the full range. However, in this case, the only candidates that fit are 2 and 7 (both 10), and 3 (3). The rest are 0. But maybe some others have a slight chance?

Wait, candidate 5: Woodhenge in England is an anti-example type, so 0. Correct.

Candidate 6: Newgrange is a passage tomb, not a circle or wheel, but in Ireland, so 0.

Candidate 3: Serpent Mound is Hopewell, ceremonial, but not a circle. So maybe 2 instead of 3?

Alternatively, if the theme is "ceremonial sites of NA Indigenous", then Serpent Mound would get higher, but structure is key here. Since the examples are all circles or wheels, structure is important.

Alternatively, maybe the key is "medicine wheels", so only those get 10, but the examples also include Miami Circle, so circles are okay.

Alternatively, maybe the medicine wheels are from the Plains, and Miami is in the Southeast, so perhaps the theme is broader. So any NA Indigenous circular ceremonial site.

Thus, the scores are as above. However, to use more of the scale, maybe some candidates are partially matching?

Wait, maybe the Carnac stones are in France, so 0. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe the user considers earthworks vs stone structures. The examples include Miami (stone holes), medicine wheels (stone). Newark is earthworks. So maybe earthworks are okay. So Newark is 10, which is earth.

Cahokia Woodhenge is wood, but still NA Indigenous and circular. So yes.

Thus, I think the scores are correct as 0,3,10 etc. But since the user wants the full range, perhaps adjust some. For example, maybe Cahokia and Newark both 10, Serpent Mound 3, and others 0. That's acceptable. So the answer would be as per that.
