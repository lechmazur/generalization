Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to figure out the specific theme they're looking for. Let me start by analyzing the examples first.

The examples are Gold Beach, Oregon; Silver Beach, Michigan; and Pearl Beach, Victoria, Australia. Hmm, the names all start with a precious metal or gemstone: Gold, Silver, Pearl. Wait, Pearl isn't a metal, but it's a gemstone or a valuable item. So maybe the theme is beaches named after precious metals or gemstones. 

Now looking at the anti-examples: Iron Beach, Brazil; Copper Beach, New York; Glass Beach, California. Iron and Copper are metals, so why are they anti-examples? Glass isn't a metal or gemstone. Wait, maybe the key is that the original examples are precious or semi-precious, while the anti-examples use more common metals like Iron and Copper, which are base metals, not precious. Glass isn't a metal at all. So perhaps the specific theme is beaches named after precious metals (like gold, silver) or gemstones (like pearl). So the anti-examples use either common metals (Iron, Copper) or a non-metal material (Glass), which doesn't fit the "precious" aspect.

So the specific theme is: Beaches named after precious metals or gemstones. Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on that.

Let's go through the candidates one by one.

1. Coral Sand Beach, Maldives. The name includes "Coral Sand". Coral isn't a metal or gemstone. It's a type of organic material from coral reefs. So this doesn't fit the theme. Maybe a 0 or low score. But wait, "Coral" could be considered a gemstone? No, coral as a gemstone is processed, but the beach here is named Coral Sand, which is more about the sand composition. Probably not matching. Maybe 1 or 2.

2. Pebble Beach, California. Pebble is a small stone. Not a precious metal or gemstone. So this is more about the type of stones on the beach. So not matching. Maybe 0 or 1. But Pebble Beach is a famous place, but the name doesn't refer to a precious material. So low score.

3. Sandstone Beach, California. Sandstone is a type of rock. Again, not a precious metal or gemstone. So probably a 0 or 1.

4. Coral Beach, Cyprus. Here, the name is Coral Beach. Coral as before, but maybe "Coral" is part of the name directly, not "Coral Sand". Still, coral isn't a metal or gemstone. Maybe a bit closer? But still not. Maybe 1 or 2.

5. Seashell Beach, Florida. Seashell refers to shells, which are common on beaches. Not a precious material. So low score, maybe 0 or 1.

6. Stone Beach, England. Stone is too generic. Not a precious metal or gem. 0 or 1.

7. Shell Beach, California. Similar to Seashell Beach. Shells are common, so 0 or 1. Wait, Shell Beach in Australia is famous for shells, but that's not the case here. Still, the name doesn't fit the theme.

8. Driftwood Beach, Georgia. Driftwood is wood washed ashore. Not a precious material. 0 or 1.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something. The examples are Gold, Silver, Pearl. Pearl is a gemstone. So the theme is names starting with a precious metal (Gold, Silver) or gemstone (Pearl). The anti-examples use Iron (common metal), Copper (common metal), and Glass (non-metal). So the key is the first word must be a precious metal or gemstone. 

Looking at the candidates again:

1. Coral Sand Beach: "Coral" is the key term. Coral isn't a metal or gemstone. So 0.

2. Pebble Beach: Pebble is not. 0.

3. Sandstone: Not. 0.

4. Coral Beach: Coral again, same as above. 0.

5. Seashell: Not. 0.

6. Stone: No. 0.

7. Shell: No. 0.

8. Driftwood: No. 0.

Wait, but maybe I'm being too strict. Let me see if any of the candidates could be closer. For example, maybe "Coral" is considered a gemstone? But coral as a gemstone is usually treated as a semi-precious stone, but the beach name here is "Coral Beach", which might refer to the color or the presence of coral, not the gemstone. So still not. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the beach's name is a precious metal or gemstone followed by "Beach", without any other words in between. The examples are all [Metal/Gem] + Beach. The candidates that have additional words like "Coral Sand Beach" might not fit, whereas "Coral Beach" is just Coral + Beach. So 4. Coral Beach, Cyprus might be a 2? Because it's closer, but still not a precious metal or gemstone. Hmm, maybe Coral is considered a gemstone in some contexts? Let me check: Coral can be a gemstone when polished, but it's made from marine organisms. So perhaps it's borderline. If the theme is strictly precious metals (like Gold, Silver) and gemstones (Pearl), then Coral could be a gemstone. In that case, Coral Beach might be a 3 or 4? But I'm not sure if Coral is commonly considered a gemstone in this context. Pearl is a gemstone, but Coral as a gem is more of a stretch. Maybe the user intended only the precious metals and pearl as the gemstone. So Coral might not qualify. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "precious metals" only, and Pearl is an exception. But the examples include Pearl, so it's part of the theme. So perhaps the theme is "precious metals or gemstones". Since Pearl is a gemstone, maybe Coral is considered a gemstone here. But I think Coral Beach would still not fit because it's not as commonly recognized as a gemstone in this context. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the first word is the name of a precious metal or gemstone, and the rest is "Beach". So Gold Beach, Silver Beach, Pearl Beach. So any candidate that has a first word that's a precious metal or gemstone followed by Beach would fit. 

Looking again at the candidates:

1. Coral Sand Beach: First word is Coral, but the full name is "Coral Sand Beach", so it's more than just [Gem] + Beach. So not.

2. Pebble Beach: Pebble is not a precious metal/gem.

3. Sandstone Beach: No.

4. Coral Beach: Just Coral + Beach. If Coral is considered a gemstone, then this would be a 10. But if not, then 0. But since Pearl is in the examples, maybe other gemstones count. Coral is a gemstone (though maybe not as common), so maybe a 5? Hmm, but the user might not consider Coral as such. Alternatively, maybe the examples are all minerals: Gold and Silver are metals, Pearl is a mineral? Wait, Pearl is a biological product, not a mineral. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe the theme is more about the color or the name being a valuable item. Alternatively, maybe the theme is the first word is a precious material (regardless of type), so Gold, Silver, Pearl (which are all valuable). Coral is valuable? Maybe in some contexts, but not as a precious material like the first three. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the names are of beaches named after precious metals (Gold, Silver) or a gemstone (Pearl), and the anti-examples use base metals (Iron, Copper) or a non-precious material (Glass). So the candidates need to have names starting with a precious metal or gemstone. 

So, looking again:

Coral: Not a precious metal, but a gemstone? If yes, then Coral Beach (4) would be a match. If not, then not. 

If Coral is not considered, then none of the candidates fit except maybe none. But the scores need to be from 0-10, so maybe some are closer. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the beach names are composed of a precious metal or gemstone followed by "Beach" with no intervening words. So Gold Beach, Silver Beach, Pearl Beach. The anti-examples have either base metals (Iron, Copper) or non-precious (Glass). The candidates:

1. Coral Sand Beach: "Coral" is the first word, but it's followed by Sand, so it's not just [Gem] + Beach. So worse than the examples.

2. Pebble Beach: Pebble isn't precious.

3. Sandstone: Not.

4. Coral Beach: Coral + Beach. If Coral is a gemstone, then this is a 10. But if not, then 0. Alternatively, since Coral isn't in the examples, but Pearl is, maybe Coral isn't included. So 0.

5. Seashell: Not.

6. Stone: No.

7. Shell: No.

8. Driftwood: No.

Hmm. If none of the candidates exactly fit, but some might be closer. For example, maybe "Coral Beach" (4) is a 2 because it's a gemstone-like name but not in the examples. "Copper Beach" was an anti-example because Copper is a base metal, but "Coral" is a gemstone? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the first word must be a precious metal (Gold, Silver) or Pearl specifically. In that case, none of the candidates match, so all would be 0. But that can't be right because the scores need to use the full range. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The examples are Gold, Silver, Pearl. The anti-examples are Iron, Copper, Glass. So the theme is the first word is a precious metal (Gold, Silver) or a gemstone (Pearl). The anti-examples use base metals (Iron, Copper) and a non-metal (Glass). 

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Coral Sand Beach: Coral could be a gemstone. If so, but the name includes "Sand", so it's not just [Gem] + Beach. So maybe a 1.

2. Pebble Beach: Pebble is a small stone, not precious. 0.

3. Sandstone: Not. 0.

4. Coral Beach: Coral + Beach. If Coral is a gemstone, then this would be a 10. But since Coral isn't in the examples, maybe it's a 5? Or maybe the user considers only the ones listed. Alternatively, since Pearl is a gemstone, Coral might be considered a gemstone, so 8? Not sure. Maybe 5?

Wait, perhaps the key is that the name is exactly [Precious Metal/Gemstone] + Beach, without any additional words. So the first word must be the precious item. So Coral Beach would fit that structure, assuming Coral is a gemstone. So if Coral counts, then 4 is a 10. But since the user didn't include Coral in the examples, maybe it's a 7? Or maybe the user expects that only the examples' types are acceptable, so only Gold, Silver, Pearl. Then Coral would be an anti-example. Wait, but the anti-examples are Iron, Copper, Glass. Coral isn't listed. So maybe Coral is a possible candidate. Alternatively, maybe the user considers that the first word must be a precious metal (Gold, Silver) or the specific gemstone Pearl. Then Coral would not be included, so 0. 

This is a bit ambiguous, but since the problem says to use the full range, maybe I need to assign some scores. Let me try again with possible scores considering that the theme is [Precious Metal or Gemstone] + Beach.

Candidates:

1. Coral Sand Beach: "Coral" is first word, but "Sand" is added. So deviates from the structure. So maybe 2.

2. Pebble: 0.

3. Sandstone: 0.

4. Coral Beach: If Coral is a gemstone, then 10. But since it's not in the examples, maybe 7? Or 5? Because it's a gemstone but not in the examples. Alternatively, maybe the user expects only the exact ones from the examples, so 0. Hmm. 

Wait, the problem says "specific theme identified from the examples", so the examples are Gold, Silver, Pearl. So the theme is specifically those three. So any other gemstone like Coral would not be part of the specific theme. Therefore, Coral Beach would not match, so 0. 

In that case, all candidates are 0 except maybe none. But the user wants a range from 0-10, so maybe some are closer. For instance, "Coral Beach" is closer to the structure (first word is a gemstone name) even if not in the examples. So maybe a 3. 

Alternatively, since none of the candidates exactly match the specific theme (only Gold, Silver, Pearl), they all get 0, but the user said to use the full range. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to assign scores based on how close they are to the examples' structure.

The examples are all [Precious Metal/Gemstone] + Beach. The anti-examples use base metals or non-precious materials. 

Looking at the candidates:

1. Coral Sand Beach: The name includes Coral (a gemstone) but adds "Sand", so it's not just [Gemstone] + Beach. So maybe a 2 (since it has a gemstone but with extra words).

2. Pebble Beach: Pebble isn't a precious material. 0.

3. Sandstone Beach: Not. 0.

4. Coral Beach: Coral is a gemstone, so if the structure is [Gemstone] + Beach, this would be a 10. But since Coral wasn't in the examples, maybe 7? Or 8? But the specific theme is based on the examples, so maybe it's not part of the specific theme. Hmm, tricky.

Wait, the problem says the theme is "specific" based on the examples. So the examples are Gold, Silver, Pearl. So the theme is specifically those three. So Coral isn't part of the theme. Therefore, Coral Beach (4) would be an anti-example if Coral isn't part of the theme. But since it's not listed as an anti-example, maybe it's a 1? Because it's a gemstone but not one of the examples.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "precious metals or gemstones", so Coral could count, making 4 a 10. But the examples include Pearl, which is a gemstone, so maybe any gemstone is acceptable. Then Coral Beach would be a 10. But the problem says the anti-examples are not part of the exact theme but are part of broader themes. Since Coral isn't an anti-example, maybe it's acceptable. 

This is confusing. Let me think again. The anti-examples are Iron, Copper, Glass. The user says the anti-examples can match a broader theme but not the exact one. So perhaps the broader theme includes any metal (even base ones) or materials, but the specific theme is precious metals and gemstones. So Coral as a gemstone would fit the specific theme, so Coral Beach (4) would be a 10. But since it's not in the examples, maybe it's a 9? Or maybe the user considers only the examples' exact terms. 

Alternatively, perhaps the specific theme is beaches named after precious metals (Gold, Silver) and a specific gemstone (Pearl), so any other gemstone (like Coral) wouldn't qualify. Hence, Coral Beach (4) would be an anti-example, but since it's not listed, maybe it's a 1. 

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. The examples have names that are precious metals (Gold, Silver) and a gemstone (Pearl). The anti-examples are base metals (Iron, Copper) and a non-metal (Glass). The candidates:

Looking for names that are precious metals or gemstones. 

Coral is a gemstone, so Coral Beach (4) would qualify. So 10. But since the user's examples didn't include Coral, maybe it's a 9? Or maybe it's exactly the same structure, so 10. 

Alternatively, if the theme is strictly the three given examples, then any other gemstone isn't part of it. But the problem states the theme is a "specific theme, rule, category, or criterion" derived from the examples. The examples include Pearl, so the rule is "precious metal or gemstone". Therefore, Coral as a gemstone would fit. 

Thus, Coral Beach (4) would be a 10. 

Then other candidates:

1. Coral Sand Beach: The name has Coral but adds Sand, so it's not just [Gemstone] + Beach. So maybe 5 because it has Coral but with extra words.

2. Pebble: 0.

3. Sandstone: 0.

4. Coral Beach: 10.

5. Seashell: 0.

6. Stone: 0.

7. Shell: 0.

8. Driftwood: 0.

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be nuanced, not just 0 and 10. So maybe Coral Sand Beach is a 7? Because it's close but not exact. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure must be exactly [Precious Metal/Gem] + Beach, no other words. So Coral Beach (4) is perfect (10), while Coral Sand Beach (1) is a 5 because it's almost there but with an extra word. 

Similarly, other candidates:

Pebble Beach (2) has a non-precious term but follows the structure, so maybe 1? Or 0. 

Alternatively, since Pebble isn't a precious material, it's 0. 

Shell Beach (7) uses Shell, which isn't precious. 0. 

So scores would be:

1. 5 (Coral Sand Beach)

2. 0

3.0

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants all scores between 0-10, using the full range. Maybe some others have small scores. For example, Driftwood Beach has "Wood", which isn't precious, but maybe 1? 

Alternatively, maybe "Coral Sand" is a type of sand, so not the gemstone itself. So Coral Sand Beach (1) is a 2. 

Coral Beach (4) is 10. 

Then:

1.2

2.0

3.0

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But that's still mostly 0s and 10. Maybe I'm missing something else. Let's see other possibilities. 

Looking at candidate 7: Shell Beach. Shell isn't precious, but maybe "Shell" is a gemstone? No. So 0. 

Candidate 5: Seashell Beach. Same as 7. 0. 

Candidate 6: Stone Beach. 0. 

Candidate 3: Sandstone is a type of rock. Not precious. 0. 

Candidate 2: Pebble Beach. 0. 

Candidate 8: Driftwood. 0. 

Candidate 1: Coral Sand Beach. Maybe 3. 

Candidate 4: Coral Beach. 10. 

But the user wants the scores to be nuanced. Maybe I need to consider other aspects. For example, "Pebble" could be a type of stone, but not precious. So 0. 

Alternatively, "Coral" is part of the beach's name, so even if it's not in the examples, it's closer than others. So Coral Beach (4) is 8, Coral Sand is 5. 

Alternatively, since the examples include Pearl (a gemstone not a metal), and the anti-examples include Glass (which is a material), perhaps the key is that the first word must be a precious metal (Gold, Silver) or a specific gemstone (Pearl). Any other gemstone (like Coral) wouldn't count. So Coral Beach (4) would be an anti-example, hence a 1 or 2. 

In that case, none of the candidates fit the specific theme except maybe none. But the user requires a range. Maybe the best approach is to assume that the theme is [Precious Metal or Gemstone] + Beach, so any gemstone would count. Then Coral Beach (4) is 10, Coral Sand is 5. 

Alternatively, maybe the first word must be a precious metal (Gold, Silver) or the specific gemstone Pearl. Then Coral isn't part of the specific theme. So Coral Beach would be an anti-example, so 1. 

But since the anti-examples given are Iron, Copper, Glass, Coral isn't listed, so maybe it's a 3. 

I think I need to make a decision here. 

Final scores:

1. Coral Sand Beach: 2 (has Coral but with extra words)

2. Pebble Beach: 0 (non-precious)

3. Sandstone Beach: 0

4. Coral Beach: 5 (Coral is a gemstone but not in examples)

5. Seashell Beach: 0

6. Stone Beach: 0

7. Shell Beach: 0

8. Driftwood Beach: 0

Alternatively, if Coral is considered part of the theme, then 4 gets 10, 1 gets 5. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is the first word is a precious metal (Gold, Silver) or gemstone (Pearl), so Pearl is the only gemstone allowed. Then Coral isn't, so 4 gets 1. 

But I'm not sure. Since the user provided three examples and three anti-examples, and Coral isn't an anti-example, maybe it's allowed. 

I'll proceed with the assumption that any gemstone or precious metal fits, so:

1. Coral Sand Beach: 5 (has gemstone but with extra words)

2. Pebble: 0

3. Sandstone:0

4. Coral Beach:10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But to spread out the scores more:

Maybe:

1. Coral Sand: 3 (Coral is gemstone, but modified name)

2. 0

3.0

4. Coral:7 (close but not in examples)

Wait, but the examples include Pearl, which is a gemstone, so Coral should be acceptable. Therefore, Coral Beach is a perfect match (10). Coral Sand is a derivative, so 6. 

Alternatively:

1. Coral Sand: 4

2.0

3.0

4.10

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants the full range, so perhaps some others get 1 or 2. For example:

Driftwood: maybe 1 because it's a natural material but not precious.

Shell Beach: maybe 1 because shells can be valuable, but not exactly.

Alternatively, all non-Coral get 0 except Coral-related. 

Hmm. I think I'll proceed with:

1. Coral Sand Beach: 3

2. 0

3.0

4. Coral Beach:7

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

This way, the Coral ones get some points, others none.
