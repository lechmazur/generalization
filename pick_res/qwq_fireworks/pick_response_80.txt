Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the three examples share. The examples given are the Great Schism of 1054 (splitting Christianity into Catholic and Eastern Orthodox), the Old Catholic Church after the First Vatican Council (due to papal infallibility), and the Protestant Reformation (dividing Western Christianity into Catholic and Protestant). 

Looking at these, they all involve significant, formal splits within an existing major religious tradition, specifically Christianity, due to doctrinal disputes leading to permanent denominational divisions. Each is a major historical schism within an established church structure, resulting in the creation of a new branch or denomination.

Now, the anti-examples are the split between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, the Anglican Church under Henry VIII, and the Mormon Church. The split in Buddhism isn't a schism within a single established church but between different schools of thought, which might be more philosophical or regional. The Anglican Church was a political split due to Henry VIII's break from Rome, more about authority and politics than doctrinal disputes. Mormonism is a completely new religion founded in the 19th century, not a schism from an existing major Christian denomination.

So the key elements of the specific theme seem to be:
1. A schism within an existing major religious institution (specifically Christian).
2. Resulting from doctrinal disputes.
3. Leading to a permanent division into distinct denominations or branches.
4. Not a new religion founded from scratch, but a split within an existing one.
5. Not primarily driven by political or personal reasons (like Henry VIII's case).

Now, evaluating each candidate against these criteria.

1. **Split between Sunni and Shia Islam after Prophet Muhammad's death**: This is a major split in Islam due to succession disputes, which are doctrinal/theological. However, the original examples are all within Christianity. The theme might be limited to Christian schisms. Since the anti-examples include non-Christian splits (Buddhism), this might not fit the specific Christian-focused theme. So maybe a 3 or 4? But the question says the theme isn't necessarily limited to Christianity, but the examples are. Wait, the anti-examples include Buddhism, so maybe the theme is specifically Christian schisms? The user didn't state the theme, but the examples are all Christian. The anti-examples include a non-Christian split (Buddhism) as an anti-example, so perhaps the specific theme is Christian denominational splits due to doctrinal disputes. Therefore, the Sunni-Shia split is non-Christian, so it's an anti-example. But the user wants to score based on the specific theme from the examples. So this would be a 0? Wait, but maybe the theme is broader than just Christianity? Let me think again. The examples are all Christian, but the anti-examples include non-Christian splits (Buddhism) as not matching. So the theme is specifically about splits within Christianity due to doctrinal issues leading to permanent denominations. Therefore, the Sunni-Shia split is outside Christianity, so it's an anti-example. So score 0? But the user's anti-examples included Buddhism as an anti-example. The candidate 1 is a split within Islam, so similar to Buddhism split, which is an anti-example. So 0? But maybe the user allows non-Christian if the criteria are met? Wait, the examples are all Christian, so perhaps the theme is specifically Christian. Therefore, candidate 1 is 0. But maybe the theme is about schisms in major religions in general, but the anti-examples include non-Christian splits (Buddhism) as not matching? Wait the anti-example's split between Theravada and Mahayana is a non-Christian split and is an anti-example, so the specific theme must be Christian. Hence, candidate 1 (Sunni/Shia) is 0.

Wait, but let me check again. The user's anti-examples include the split between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism as an anti-example, which is a non-Christian split, so the theme must be specifically about splits within Christianity. Therefore, any non-Christian split is an anti-example. So candidate 1 (Sunni/Shia) is 0.

2. **Rise of Jehovah's Witnesses in late 19th century**: This is a new religious movement, not a schism from an existing major Christian denomination. They started as a separate group, so it's more like Mormonism (anti-example). So score low, maybe 1 or 2.

3. **Formation of Unitarian Universalist Association in 20th century**: The UUA is a merger of two denominations (Unitarians and Universalists), so it's a unification, not a schism. So that's opposite. So 0.

4. **Council of Nicaea 325 CE**: Didn't result in a permanent division. The examples all resulted in permanent splits. So this is an anti-example. So 0.

5. **Rise of Bahá'í Faith in 19th century**: A new religion, not a split from an existing major Christian group. Like Mormonism, so 0.

6. **Formation of Seventh-day Adventist Church in 19th century**: Adventists split from other Protestant groups, specifically Millerites. They emerged from a schism after the Great Disappointment. This is a doctrinal split (timing of Sabbath, etc.) leading to a new denomination within Christianity. So this fits the theme. Maybe a 7 or 8? The Protestant Reformation example is 16th century, so Adventists are similar. But Adventists are a later split within Protestantism. So maybe 8.

7. **Amish in 17th century**: Split from the Mennonites over issues like technology use and church discipline. This is a doctrinal split within Anabaptist tradition. So fits the theme. The examples are major splits, but the Amish are a smaller sect. Maybe 6 or 7?

8. **Quaker movement in 17th century**: Founded by George Fox as a new religious group, but it split from the broader Christian tradition, perhaps more of a new movement than a schism from an existing denomination. Quakers were more of a radical reform movement within Puritanism, but some see them as a separate group. It's a bit ambiguous. If it's considered a schism from existing Protestant groups, maybe 5. If it's a new sect, then lower. Maybe 4.

Wait, need to be precise. The Amish split from Mennonites, which were already a sect, so that's a clear schism. Quakers emerged more as a new movement, though they were reacting to existing Protestant practices. So perhaps the Quakers are more like the Anglicans (anti-example), which was a political split. Since the Anglican split (Henry VIII) is an anti-example, maybe the Quakers are also lower. The Amish would be a better fit. So:

Re-evaluating:

Candidate 1: 0 (non-Christian)

2. Jehovah's Witnesses: 1 (new movement)

3. Unitarian Universalist: 0 (merger)

4. Nicaea: 0 (no split)

5. Bahá'í: 0 (new religion)

6. Seventh-day Adventist: 8 (doctrinal split within Christianity leading to new denomination)

7. Amish: 7 (similar to Adventists but smaller, but still a clear schism)

8. Quakers: 4 (arguably a new movement, not a schism from an existing major denomination like the examples)

Wait, but the Protestant Reformation includes splits like Lutherans, Calvinists, etc., which are major. The Amish and Adventist are later splits within Protestantism, so they fit. The Quakers started as a movement within Puritanism but are considered a separate denomination. Maybe the Quakers are a 5 or 6. Alternatively, since they didn't split from a major existing church but emerged as a new group, perhaps lower. Since the Anglican split (Henry VIII) is an anti-example (political), the Quakers might be similar to that in being a new movement rather than a doctrinal split from an existing denomination. So maybe 3? Hmm.

Alternatively, the Quakers did split from Puritanism, so maybe it's considered a schism. But the key is whether it's a formal split from an existing established church. The examples are major splits, so maybe the Quakers are a 5.

I need to assign scores between 0-10, with granularity. Let me finalize:

1. 0 (non-Christian)

2. 1 (new movement)

3. 0 (merger)

4. 0 (no split)

5. 0 (new religion)

6. 8 (good fit)

7. 7 (slightly less major than examples but still fits)

8. 4 (arguably a new movement, not a schism like the examples)
