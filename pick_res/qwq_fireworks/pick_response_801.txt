Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the examples given: cell membrane, dialysis machine, and kidney. Let me think about their commonalities.

The cell membrane is a biological structure that regulates what enters and exits a cell. A dialysis machine is a medical device that filters waste products from the blood, similar to how kidneys function. The kidney itself is an organ that filters blood to remove waste and excess fluids. So the common theme here seems to be filtration or selective permeabilityâ€”systems that allow certain substances to pass through while blocking others.

Now, looking at the anti-examples: turnstile, ventilation duct, revolving door. These are all structures that control the movement of people or air but don't involve filtration or selective permeability in the same way. Turnstiles control access, ventilation ducts move air, and revolving doors let people pass while maintaining climate control. So the anti-examples are about passage control but not filtration.

Next, I need to evaluate each candidate against the specific theme of filtration/selective permeability, not the broader themes like barriers or passage control.

1. **Drawbridge**: A drawbridge allows or blocks passage over a body of water. It's more about access control, like the anti-examples. Doesn't involve filtration. So maybe a low score, like 2 or 3.

2. **Pipeline**: A pipeline transports fluids or gases. It might have filters, but its primary function is transportation, not filtration itself. Unless it's a specific type like a filter pipe, but generally, it's lower. Maybe 4?

3. **Air filter**: This directly filters air, removing particles. That's exactly the theme. Should be high, maybe 9 or 10. Wait, but the anti-examples include ventilation duct, which is related but not filtration. Since air filter is a direct match, maybe 10? Hmm, but the examples are biological and medical. The dialysis machine is a machine, so maybe air filter is okay. Let's see others first.

4. **Door**: A door controls access, similar to turnstile or revolving door. Not filtration. Score 1 or 2.

5. **Window**: Windows can have filters like screens, but their main function is light/ventilation. Not primary filtration. Maybe 3?

6. **Canal**: A waterway for transport. Similar to pipeline but for boats. No filtration. Maybe 1?

7. **Tunnel**: Like a passage through a mountain. Again, passage, not filtration. 0 or 1?

8. **Gate**: Controls entry, like a turnstile or door. Not filtration. 2?

Wait, let me reassess. The theme is selective permeability/filtration. So:

- Air filter (3) is a direct match (filtration system). So 10?
- Pipeline: If it's used for transporting without filtering, maybe 3, but if it can have filters, maybe higher. But the primary function isn't filtering. So maybe 4?
- Canal and tunnel: 0 or 1. Since they don't filter anything, just transport.
- Drawbridge: maybe 2, since it's a barrier but not filtering.
- Door and gate: 1 or 2, since they control access but not filtration.
- Window with screens might get a 3 because of the screen's filtration, but the window itself isn't primarily for that. So 3.
- Wait, maybe the dialysis machine and kidney are about filtering bodily fluids, cell membrane about cells. So any system that actively filters substances. So pipeline that transports without filtering is low. But if it's part of a system that filters (like in a water treatment plant), but the pipeline itself isn't. Hmm. So maybe pipeline is 3. Canal is 1. Tunnel 0. 

Let me list them again with possible scores:

1. Drawbridge: 2 (barrier, not filtering)
2. Pipeline: 4 (transport, maybe has filters but not primary)
3. Air filter: 10 (direct filtration)
4. Door: 1 (access control)
5. Window: 3 (screens are a filter, but window's main function isn't)
6. Canal: 1 (transport)
7. Tunnel: 0 (passage)
8. Gate: 2 (barrier)

Wait, but the anti-examples include ventilation duct, which is part of air flow. The window with a screen could be similar to a filter but maybe the duct is more about moving air, while the filter is about stopping particles. So air filter is definitely a 10. 

Rechecking others:

- Pipeline: If it's a pipeline that's part of a filtration system, like in a water line with filters, but the pipeline itself is just transport. So maybe 3. But maybe 4 because it's a conduit that could have filtration elements. Hmm. Maybe 4 is okay.

- Canal: Maybe 1, as it's a waterway, no filtration.

- Tunnel: 0, just a passage.

- Door: 1, gate: 2, drawbridge:2, window:3, pipeline:4, air filter:10, canal:1, tunnel:0, door:1, gate:2.

Wait, the user wants the scores in the order given, from 1 to 8. Let me list all candidates again:

1. Drawbridge: 2
2. Pipeline: 4
3. Air filter: 10
4. Door: 1
5. Window: 3
6. Canal: 1
7. Tunnel: 0
8. Gate: 2

But let me see if there's a better way. Maybe the cell membrane, dialysis, kidney all involve biological or medical filtration. So air filter is a perfect match. Pipeline might be part of a system but not a filter itself. So 4 is okay. Canal is just transport, so 1. Tunnel is 0. 

Alternatively, maybe pipeline is 3 and drawbridge 2. 

Wait, maybe the dialysis machine and kidney are examples of organs or devices that filter bodily fluids. The cell membrane does the same for cells. So any mechanical or biological system that filters substances. 

An air filter fits exactly. 

A canal is a waterway, maybe not filtering. 

A pipeline could transport filtered water, but the pipe itself isn't a filter. So maybe 3. 

Drawbridge is a barrier, so 2. 

Gate is similar to drawbridge, so 2. 

Door is 1. 

Window with a screen might be 3, but if the window itself isn't filtering, maybe 2. 

Hmm, perhaps adjust window to 2. 

Wait, but the window screen is part of the window, so maybe window can be 3. 

I think my initial scores are okay. Let me proceed.
