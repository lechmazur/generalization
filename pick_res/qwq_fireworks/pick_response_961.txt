Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the given examples: phonocardiogram, otoacoustic emissions test, and tympanometry. 

Starting with the examples:

1. **Phonocardiogram**: This is a test that records the heart's sounds to detect abnormalities. The prefix "phono-" relates to sound, and "cardio" to the heart. So it's a diagnostic tool using sound for the heart.

2. **Otoacoustic emissions test**: "Oto-" relates to the ear. This test measures sounds emitted by the inner ear to assess hearing function, especially in the cochlea.

3. **Tympanometry**: This measures the movement of the eardrum in response to varying air pressures. It's used to assess middle ear function.

So, the common theme here seems to be **diagnostic tests or measurements related to hearing or inner ear function using sound or acoustic properties**. They are all non-invasive, objective tests used in audiology or cardiology (phonocardiogram is for the heart, but still uses sound).

Now, the anti-examples are:

- **Audiologist consultation**: This is a service provided by a professional, not a test.
- **Ultrasound imaging**: A broader imaging technique, not specific to hearing or ear function.
- **Cochlear implant**: A surgical device, not a diagnostic test.

So the key is that the specific theme is diagnostic tests involving sound/acoustic measurements for hearing or heart function (though the first example is heart, but the others are ear-related). The anti-examples are either services, treatments, or devices.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. **Acoustic trauma treatment**: Treatment, not a diagnostic test. Anti-example like cochlear implant is a device, but treatment is more like a therapy. So this is a treatment, so 0 or low.

2. **Hearing aid fitting**: This is a process of adjusting hearing aids, a service/procedure, not a diagnostic test. So similar to audiologist consultation (anti-example), so low score.

3. **Vocal cord examination**: Examines vocal cords, maybe via endoscopy. Not using sound/acoustic measurements specifically for hearing. It's related to voice, but not the same as the examples. Maybe a 3 or so.

4. **Sound wave therapy**: Therapy again, not diagnostic. Like treatment. So low.

5. **Auscultation**: Listening to internal sounds (like heart/lungs) using a stethoscope. Phonocardiogram is a type of auscultation recorded. So this is very close. Maybe 8 or 9?

6. **Tinnitus treatment**: Treatment again, so low.

7. **Acoustic neuroma surgery**: Surgery, a treatment, so 0.

8. **Voice analysis**: Could involve acoustic measurements of the voice. Similar to otoacoustic emissions but for voice instead of hearing. Maybe a 5 or 6?

Wait, let me think again. The examples are all tests for hearing or heart function using sound. 

Auscultation (number 5) is directly related to listening to body sounds, like phonocardiogram. So that's a strong candidate, maybe 9 or 10. But the original examples include tests that are more specific (like tympanometry for the ear). Since auscultation is a broader term (used in cardiology and pulmonology), but phonocardiogram is a specific type. So maybe 8?

Vocal cord examination (3): If it's done via stethoscope or endoscopy, maybe not purely acoustic. If it's using acoustic analysis, maybe higher. But the term is vague. Maybe 3-4.

Voice analysis (8): If it's analyzing voice acoustics, similar to how otoacoustic emissions measure ear sounds. So maybe 6 or 7?

Sound wave therapy (4) and treatments (1,6,7) are all therapies, so 0-2.

Hearing aid fitting (2): procedure, so 1-2.

So assigning scores:

1. Acoustic trauma treatment: 0 (treatment)
2. Hearing aid fitting: 1 (procedure)
3. Vocal cord examination: 3 (exam but not acoustic test)
4. Sound wave therapy: 0 (therapy)
5. Auscultation: 8 (directly related to phonocardiogram)
6. Tinnitus treatment: 0 (treatment)
7. Acoustic neuroma surgery: 0 (surgery)
8. Voice analysis: 6 (acoustic analysis but not hearing-specific)
