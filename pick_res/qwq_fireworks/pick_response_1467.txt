Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the specific theme based on the examples provided. The examples are:

1. A Soviet research station in Antarctica with equipment and personal items left behind in 1992.
2. A 1950s Nevada desert diner with plates still on tables and coffee cups on counters.
3. The Pripyat amusement park in Ukraine with its untouched Ferris wheel and bumper cars.

Looking at these, the common theme seems to be locations that were abruptly abandoned, leaving behind their contents intact. They have a sense of being frozen in time, with items left as they were when the place was vacated. The key elements here are the presence of personal or functional items left behind, giving an impression of sudden abandonment without removal of belongings.

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. A demolished shopping mall – this is more about destruction rather than abandonment with items left behind.
2. A closed museum with artifacts moved to storage – here, items were removed, so it's not about leaving things behind.
3. An emptied prison facility – again, items were taken away, so it's not matching the specific theme of untouched remnants.

So, the specific theme is about places that were abandoned without removing the belongings, leaving them as they were. The anti-examples involve removal of items (like storage) or destruction, which are not part of the theme.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. **Empty warehouse cleared out before closing** – If it was cleared out, then the items are gone. This is similar to the anti-examples where things were removed. So this should be a low score, maybe 1 or 2.

2. **Japanese elementary school with books, desks, etc. intact** – This fits well. The items are left behind, suggesting abandonment without removal. High score, maybe 8 or 9.

3. **Cleaned-out foreclosed home** – Cleaned-out means they removed stuff, so similar to anti-examples. Low score, maybe 1 or 2.

4. **Ghost town's stripped buildings** – Stripped implies items were taken away. So low, maybe 0 or 1.

5. **Closed-down airport terminal** – This is ambiguous. If it's just closed but items remain, maybe moderate. But airports often have equipment moved. Maybe 5? Not sure yet.

6. **Cleaned-out abandoned mine** – Cleaned-out again, so low score like 1 or 2.

7. **Decommissioned military base properly cleared** – Properly cleared means they removed equipment, so low score, maybe 0 or 1.

8. **Bankrupt store after liquidation** – Liquidation means selling off items, so nothing left. Very low, maybe 0 or 1.

Wait, but let me think again. The examples all have items left behind. The anti-examples are when items are removed. So any candidate that has been cleared, cleaned, stripped, or liquidated would be low. The ones where items remain intact would be high.

So:

1. Empty warehouse cleared out → 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

2. School with intact items → 9 or 10. Since the examples include research stations and diners, a school with books and desks fits well. Maybe 9.

3. Cleaned-out home → 1.

4. Stripped buildings → 0 or 1. Maybe 0.

5. Closed airport – if it's just closed but not cleared, maybe some items remain. But airports might have equipment removed. Maybe 3? Not sure. If it's closed but terminals have chairs, check-in desks, etc., maybe 5. Hmm. The examples include a research station, diner, and amusement park. An airport terminal could be similar to a diner in being a public place left as is. But if it's "closed-down" but not stripped, maybe 5 or 6.

Wait, the examples didn't specify that the closure was due to disaster (like Pripyat), but rather just left behind. The airport could be a good candidate if it's left with items. But if "closed-down" implies it was properly closed, maybe some items were taken. Maybe 4 or 5.

6. Cleaned-out mine → 1.

7. Cleared military base → 0.

8. Liquidated store → 0.

Wait, let's recheck each candidate again carefully.

Candidate 1: Empty warehouse cleared out before closing – cleared out means items removed, so low. 1.

Candidate 2: School with intact items – high, maybe 9.

Candidate 3: Cleaned-out foreclosed home – items removed, so 1.

Candidate4: Ghost town's stripped buildings – stripped means items taken, so 0.

Candidate5: Closed-down airport terminal – if it's closed but not stripped, maybe some items remain (like chairs, signage). So maybe 5? The examples include a closed research station, so perhaps an airport terminal left with chairs and counters would be similar to the diner. But if it's just closed but not abandoned with items left, maybe 5. Alternatively, maybe 6.

Candidate6: Cleaned-out mine – 1.

Candidate7: Decommissioned military base properly cleared – cleared means items removed, so 0.

Candidate8: Bankrupt store after liquidation – liquidation means sold off, so 0.

So the scores would be:

1. 1

2. 9

3. 1

4. 0

5. 5

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

Wait, but the anti-examples include "closed museum with artifacts moved to storage" which is similar to cleared-out. So "closed museum" is an anti-example, so the specific theme excludes such cases. So the military base properly cleared (7) is like the anti-example, so 0.

The airport terminal (5): if it's closed but not stripped, like the diner, then maybe higher. Let me think again. The examples are all about abandonment with items left. A closed airport might have chairs, check-in desks, etc., if not cleared. So maybe 6?

Alternatively, maybe 5. Let's see. The examples are all places that are abandoned and left as-is. The airport terminal could be similar. But if it's just closed but not abandoned? Hmm, maybe the term "closed-down" might imply it's no longer in use, but not necessarily abandoned with items left. So perhaps it's a middle score. Maybe 5.

Alternatively, maybe the anti-examples include "closed museum" which was moved, so a closed airport that's not moved items would fit. So perhaps 6?

Hmm, tricky. Let me see other candidates. The school (2) is a strong example. The mine cleaned-out (6) is low. The ghost town stripped (4) is 0.

So for candidate 5, airport terminal closed-down, perhaps 5.

Now, the scores as per above:

1:1

2:9

3:1

4:0

5:5

6:1

7:0

8:0

Wait, but let's check if there's a better way. The examples have the key element of "abandoned with items left". The anti-examples are when items are removed. So candidates that have items remaining get high scores, those with items removed get low.

Candidate 5: If the airport terminal is closed but not cleared, then items like chairs, counters, maybe even planes or equipment might remain. So that's a good fit. So maybe 7?

Wait, the examples include a research station (equipment left), a diner (plates, cups), an amusement park (Ferris wheel, bumper cars). So an airport terminal left with its check-in counters, chairs, maybe even planes parked would be similar. So maybe 7.

Hmm, perhaps I was too conservative before. Let's adjust:

Candidate 5: 7.

Candidate 2: 9 or 10? The school with books and desks intact. The examples include a research station with personal items. A school is similar, so maybe 9 or 10. Let's say 9.

Candidate 1: cleared out → 1.

Candidate 3: cleaned-out →1.

Candidate4: stripped →0.

Candidate6: cleaned-out →1.

Candidate7: cleared →0.

Candidate8: liquidated →0.

Candidate5:7.

So scores would be:

1. 1

2. 9

3. 1

4. 0

5.7

6.1

7.0

8.0

That seems better.

Wait, but maybe the school is even higher. Since the examples are all specific places with their function's items left. A school with books and desks is exactly that. So maybe 10?

Wait the examples are all from different contexts but all have items left as they were. The Soviet station (research equipment and personal items), the diner (plates, cups), Pripyat's amusement park (rides). So a school with desks and books is analogous. So perhaps 10.

But the user said "use the full range". Since the examples are perfect matches, maybe 10 is okay. But maybe the user's examples are all real places? The Soviet station and Pripyat are real. The Nevada diner might be a fictional example. But the instruction says to base it on the examples given.

Alternatively, maybe 9 to leave room for possible nuances. Let me think. The anti-examples are not exact. The school is a perfect match. So 10. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the school is on a remote island, which adds to the isolation, making it more like the Antarctic station. So 10.

So adjusting:

Candidate2: 10.

Then:

1:1

2:10

3:1

4:0

5:7

6:1

7:0

8:0

Is that okay?

Wait, but the user's examples include the Soviet station (1992), the 50s diner, and Pripyat (abandoned due to Chernobyl). The school is a similar situation, so maybe 10.

Alternatively, maybe 9 because it's a school, not exactly a research station or amusement park, but still fits the theme. But the theme is about items left behind, so the category is broader than the examples. The theme is "abandoned with items left as they were". So the school is a perfect example, so 10.

Hmm. Let me proceed with that. Then the scores would be:

1. Empty warehouse cleared out →1

2. School →10

3. Cleaned-out home →1

4. Stripped buildings →0

5. Closed airport →7

6. Cleaned-out mine →1

7. Cleared military base →0

8. Liquidated store →0

Yes, this makes sense. The school is the best match (10). The airport is a middle score (7), as it's a functional place left with items but perhaps less "abandoned" in the same sense as the examples. The others are low.
