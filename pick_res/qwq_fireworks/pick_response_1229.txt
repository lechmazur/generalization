Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the given examples and anti-examples. The examples are Quark star (hypothetical), Neutron star, and Magnetar. These all seem to be types of extremely dense stellar remnants. Quark stars and neutron stars are both theoretical or observed dense objects formed after supernovae. Magnetars are a type of neutron star with ultra-strong magnetic fields. So the theme here is probably "extremely dense stellar remnants" or "compact objects resulting from stellar collapse."

Now the anti-examples are Singularity, Event horizon, and Gravitational wave. These are related to black holes or general relativity phenomena but aren't themselves stellar remnants. Singularities and event horizons are parts of black holes, while gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime. So the anti-examples are broader concepts connected to the theme but not part of the specific category of dense stellar remnants.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this theme. Let's go through each one:

1. **Black hole**: Hmm, black holes are also dense objects, but they're not exactly stellar remnants in the same way as neutron stars or magnetars. They form from more massive stars, but the anti-examples include singularity and event horizon, which are parts of black holes. Since the anti-examples are part of black holes, maybe the theme excludes black holes? But wait, the examples are all types of stars, while black holes are not stars. So maybe the theme is specifically stellar remnants that are not black holes. So black hole might be an anti-example. But the anti-examples given don't include black holes. Hmm. Need to think carefully. The examples are all types of stars (even if hypothetical), while black holes are not stars. So maybe the theme is "dense stellar remnants that are not black holes." Then black hole would be a 0. But let me check others first.

2. **Gravitational lensing**: This is a phenomenon caused by massive objects bending spacetime, so it's a general relativistic effect. Not a stellar remnant. Definitely an anti-example. So 0 or low score.

3. **Dark matter**: This is a form of matter that doesn't interact electromagnetically, so not a stellar remnant. Doesn't fit. 0.

4. **Pulsar**: A pulsar is a type of neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation. The examples include neutron stars and magnetars, which are subsets of neutron stars. Magnetars are a type of pulsar with extreme magnetic fields. So pulsars are definitely in the same category. So this should be a 10? Wait the examples include neutron star and magnetar, so pulsar is a close relative. But maybe the theme is specifically the densest objects beyond neutron stars? Wait, quark stars are hypothetical, but pulsars are neutron stars. So pulsar is a good fit, maybe 10. But need to check the others.

5. **Wormhole (hypothetical)**: A theoretical structure connecting spacetimes. Not a stellar remnant. So this would be an anti-example, maybe similar to singularity or event horizon. 0 or low.

6. **Quasar**: A very luminous active galactic nucleus powered by a supermassive black hole. Not a stellar remnant. So 0.

7. **Accretion disk**: A structure around a massive object (like a black hole or neutron star) where matter accumulates. It's a phenomenon, not a remnant itself. So 0.

8. **Cosmic string (hypothetical)**: A theoretical 1D defect in spacetime from the early universe. Not a stellar remnant. So low score.

Wait, let me re-express the theme again. The examples are all types of extremely dense compact objects formed from stellar collapse: neutron stars (including magnetars and quark stars if they exist). The anti-examples are parts of black holes or spacetime effects. So the theme is "compact objects formed from the collapse of massive stars, excluding black holes."

So, candidates:

1. Black hole: Excluded because the theme excludes black holes (since anti-examples include parts of them). So 0.

2. Gravitational lensing: Not an object. 0.

3. Dark matter: Not related. 0.

4. Pulsar: A neutron star, which is in the examples. So 10.

5. Wormhole: Not related. 0.

6. Quasar: Not a stellar remnant. 0.

7. Accretion disk: Not an object. 0.

8. Cosmic string: Not a stellar remnant. 0.

Wait but maybe some have higher scores? Let me think again. Maybe the theme is "compact stellar remnants", which includes neutron stars, magnetars, quark stars, and maybe pulsars (since pulsars are neutron stars). So pulsar is definitely a 10. But what about white dwarfs? They aren't listed. The examples given are neutron star, magnetar, quark star. So maybe the theme is specifically "ultra-dense stellar remnants beyond white dwarfs". So pulsar is a neutron star, so yes. 

But what about the anti-examples? The anti-examples include singularity (part of black hole), event horizon (part of black hole), gravitational wave (effect from spacetime). So any object related to black holes (like black hole itself) is excluded. So black hole is excluded, so 0.

But what about other candidates? Let's see:

Is there any other candidate that's a stellar remnant but not a black hole? Pulsar is. Are there others?

Looking at the list again:

1. Black hole – 0

2. Gravitational lensing – 0

3. Dark matter – 0

4. Pulsar – 10

5. Wormhole – 0

6. Quasar – 0

7. Accretion disk – 0

8. Cosmic string – 0

Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the candidates again.

Wait, quark stars are hypothetical, but pulsars are a subset of neutron stars. The examples include neutron star and magnetar (a type of neutron star), so pulsar fits. So 4 is 10.

What about other candidates:

Is there anything else? Let me see candidate 6: Quasar. Quasars are powered by supermassive black holes, so not a stellar remnant. Candidate 7: Accretion disk is a structure around a massive object, not the object itself. Candidate 5: Wormhole is a hypothetical structure, not a remnant. Candidate 8: Cosmic strings are hypothetical, but they're not from stellar collapse. So all others are 0 except pulsar (4) which is 10.

Wait but the user mentioned that the scores should use the full range, so maybe some candidates are partial matches?

Wait, maybe I need to consider if any of the candidates are related but not exact. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the anti-examples are part of a broader theme. For example, the theme might be "compact objects formed from stellar collapse", but the anti-examples are parts of black holes or spacetime effects. But maybe there are other stellar remnants that are not the examples?

Wait, white dwarfs are stellar remnants, but they are less dense than neutron stars. Since the examples are neutron stars, magnetars, quark stars, perhaps the theme is "ultra-dense stellar remnants beyond white dwarfs", so white dwarfs are excluded. But the candidates don't include white dwarfs. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "neutron star and its variants", so magnetars and quark stars (hypothetical) are included. Then pulsars are neutron stars, so they fit. But what about other neutron star types? Pulsars are a type of neutron star, so that's fine.

Looking at candidate 1: Black hole. Since it's a remnant but the theme excludes black holes (since anti-examples include their parts), it's a 0.

Candidate 8: Cosmic string is hypothetical but not a stellar remnant. 0.

Wait, maybe the theme is "hypothetical or observed dense stellar remnants that are not black holes". Then quark stars (hypothetical), neutron stars (observed), magnetars (observed, a type of neutron star). So pulsars are included. 

What about other candidates?

Candidate 5: Wormhole is hypothetical but not a remnant. So 0.

Candidate 7: Accretion disk is not a remnant. 0.

Candidate 2: Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon, so 0.

Candidate 3: Dark matter isn't a remnant. 0.

Candidate 6: Quasar is not a remnant. 0.

So the only one that fits is pulsar (4) with 10. But the user wants scores from 0-10 with nuance. Maybe I missed something?

Wait, candidate 4 is pulsar, which is a neutron star, so that's a perfect match, so 10. The other candidates are 0. But the user says "use the full range". Maybe I need to think again. Did I misinterpret the theme?

Wait, perhaps the theme is "extremely dense objects in space", which would include black holes. But then the anti-examples include singularity (part of BH) but the anti-examples are not part of the theme. Hmm, but the problem states that the anti-examples are part of a broader theme but not the specific one. So the specific theme must exclude those.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "stellar remnants that are not black holes". So neutron stars, quark stars, magnetars. Then pulsar is a neutron star, so yes. But what about other remnants? Like white dwarfs? They are remnants but less dense. Since they aren't in examples, maybe the theme requires higher density. So only neutron star variants.

Therefore, only pulsar (4) is a 10. The rest are 0. But the user said to use the full range. Maybe there are some candidates that are partially related?

Wait, candidate 8 is cosmic string, which is hypothetical. The examples include a hypothetical (quark star), so maybe cosmic string is a stretch. But it's not a stellar remnant. So still 0.

Candidate 5: Wormhole is hypothetical but not a remnant. 0.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "hypothetical or observed dense objects from stellar collapse, excluding black holes". Then pulsar is included, and maybe other hypothetical ones?

Wait, quark star is hypothetical, but the theme includes it. So if a candidate is another hypothetical dense object, maybe it gets some points?

Candidate 5: Wormhole is a spacetime structure, not a remnant. 0.

Candidate 8: Cosmic strings are hypothetical but not remnants. 0.

Hmm. Maybe the user expects some candidates to have mid-range scores. Did I miss something?

Wait, looking back at the anti-examples: event horizon and gravitational wave are related to black holes and spacetime effects, so any candidate related to black holes would be excluded, but other dense objects not black holes are included. Are there any other dense objects?

Candidate 7: Accretion disk is around a black hole or neutron star, but it's not the object itself. So 0.

Candidate 6: Quasar is powered by a supermassive black hole, so not a remnant. 0.

Candidate 2: Gravitational lensing is an effect, so 0.

Candidate 3: Dark matter isn't related. 0.

Candidate 1: Black hole is excluded, so 0.

So only pulsar (4) is a 10. But the user wants scores from 0-10 with nuance. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "compact objects with strong magnetic fields". The examples include magnetars (extremely magnetic neutron stars), neutron stars, and quark stars (which might have strong fields). Then pulsars have magnetic fields too, but not as strong as magnetars. So maybe pulsars are a 9? But magnetars are part of the examples. Hmm, but the theme might not be magnetic fields specifically, since neutron stars in general are included.

Alternatively, the theme is "stellar remnants formed from supernovae that are not black holes". Then pulsars (neutron stars) fit, but maybe white dwarfs also, but they aren't in the examples. Since the examples include neutron stars, quark stars, magnetars, which are all post-supernova but more dense than white dwarfs.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "objects composed primarily of neutrons or other exotic matter". Then neutron stars, magnetars, quark stars (quark matter). Pulsars are neutron stars, so yes. But what about others?

Candidate 5: Wormhole? No. Candidate 8: cosmic strings? Not made of neutrons. So still 0.

Hmm, maybe the user expects some candidates to have scores like 5 or 7. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the theme is "compact objects that are remnants of massive stars", which includes neutron stars, quark stars, magnetars, and also black holes. But the anti-examples include singularity (part of BH), so BHs are excluded. So BH is excluded. Then what about other remnants?

Wait, maybe the theme is "stellar remnants that are not black holes, but are extremely dense", so neutron stars, quark stars, magnetars. So pulsar is a neutron star, so 10. What about other neutron star types? Pulsars are a type, so yes. Are there any other candidates that are neutron stars or similar? Not in the list.

Wait, candidate 6 is a quasar. Quasars are active galactic nuclei, not remnants. So no.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the examples and anti-examples again. The examples are all types of neutron stars or hypothetical variants. The anti-examples are parts of black holes or spacetime effects. So the theme is "types of neutron stars and their hypothetical variants (like quark stars)". Then:

- Pulsar is a neutron star, so 10.

- Black hole is not a neutron star, so 0.

- The others are unrelated, so 0.

But the user wants scores to use the full range. Maybe I need to consider that some candidates are partially related but not exact. For example:

Candidate 5: Wormhole is hypothetical like quark star, but not a remnant. Maybe 1?

Candidate 8: Cosmic string is hypothetical and a structure, so 1?

Candidate 4 is 10, others are 0 except maybe some low scores for hypotheticals not fitting the theme?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "compact objects formed from stellar collapse, excluding black holes". Then:

- Pulsar (neutron star): 10

- Black hole: 0

- Quark star (example) is hypothetical, but candidate 5 wormhole is not a remnant. So others are 0.

Hmm. I think I need to proceed with the initial assessment, even if it results in many 0s and one 10, but the user said to use the full range. Wait, perhaps I missed a candidate.

Looking again:

Candidate 7: Accretion disk. Is there any way this relates? Maybe it's part of a system around a neutron star, but it's not the remnant itself. So no.

Candidate 2: Gravitational lensing is caused by mass, which could be a neutron star, but it's a phenomenon, not the object.

Wait, maybe the theme is "objects that are remnants of massive stars, not black holes", so neutron stars (including magnetars, pulsars, quark stars). So pulsar is a 10. Then:

Candidate 4: 10.

Others: 0 except maybe:

What about candidate 6: Quasar? No, it's not a remnant.

Candidate 5: Wormhole? No.

Candidate 8: Cosmic string? No.

Hmm. I think I have to go with that. But the user said to use the full range. Maybe I made a mistake in the theme?

Wait, maybe the theme is "objects that are extremely dense, but not black holes". Then:

- Neutron stars (including magnetars, pulsars, quark stars) fit.

- What about white dwarfs? They're dense but less than neutron stars. Since they aren't in examples, maybe they're excluded.

- Other candidates:

Candidate 5: Wormhole? Not dense.

Candidate 7: Accretion disk? Not dense.

Candidate 3: Dark matter? Not dense.

Candidate 1: Black hole is excluded.

Candidate 2: Gravitational lensing is effect.

Candidate 6: Quasar is not dense.

Candidate 8: Cosmic strings are hypothetical but not dense remnants.

So still only pulsar (4) is 10. The rest are 0. But the user said to use the full range. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "hypothetical or observed dense objects beyond neutron stars". So quark stars (hypothetical) and maybe others. Then:

Candidate 5: Wormhole is hypothetical but not dense.

Candidate 8: Cosmic strings are hypothetical but not dense.

Candidate 1: Black hole is a dense object but excluded.

Hmm. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "objects that are remnants of supernovae, not black holes". Then:

- Neutron stars (including pulsars, magnetars, quark stars) are remnants of supernovae.

- So pulsar is 10.

- What about white dwarfs? They are remnants but less dense. Since they aren't in the examples, maybe they're excluded.

So again, only pulsar (4) is 10.

Wait, maybe the theme is "compact objects with strong magnetic fields", since magnetars have strong fields. Neutron stars generally have strong fields, and pulsars too. Then:

- Pulsar: 10.

- Magnetars are examples, so yes.

- But quark stars may or may not have strong fields.

But then, are there other candidates with strong fields? Like maybe not.

Alternatively, the theme is "objects that are neutron stars or their variants". So pulsar is a neutron star (10), magnetars are a variant (example). Then others are 0.

Hmm. I think the answer has to be pulsar as 10, others 0. But the user wants scores using the full range. Maybe I made a mistake in the theme.

Wait, looking back at the examples: Quark star (hypothetical), Neutron star, Magnetar. The commonality is they are all types of neutron stars or their more extreme variants. So the theme is "types of neutron stars and their hypothetical variants". Thus:

- Pulsar is a type of neutron star → 10.

- Black hole is a different object → 0.

- The other candidates are unrelated → 0.

But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe there's another angle. Let me think of the anti-examples again. The anti-examples are singularity, event horizon, gravitational wave. These are all associated with black holes or spacetime effects. The theme is about stellar remnants (neutron stars etc.), so anything related to black holes (even the object itself) is excluded. Thus, black hole is 0. The rest are 0 except pulsar.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "objects that are more dense than white dwarfs but not black holes". Neutron stars fit, pulsars are neutron stars. So pulsar is 10. The others are 0.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "objects that are remnants of massive stars that underwent core-collapse". Then neutron stars (including pulsars, magnetars, quark stars) fit. So pulsar is 10. Black hole is another remnant but excluded. Others are not remnants.

Hmm. I think the only possible score is 10 for pulsar and 0 for others. But the user wants the full range. Maybe I need to consider that some candidates are partially related.

Wait, candidate 8: cosmic string is hypothetical, like quark star. Maybe it gets a 1 because it's hypothetical but not related to the theme.

Candidate 5: wormhole is hypothetical but not related → 0.

Candidate 1: black hole is excluded → 0.

Candidate 7: accretion disk is around a remnant but not the remnant → 0.

Candidate 2: gravitational lensing is effect → 0.

Candidate 3: dark matter → 0.

Candidate 6: quasar → 0.

So only pulsar (4) is 10. The rest are 0. But the user said to use the full range. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the examples include a hypothetical (quark star), so maybe hypothetical objects can get some points if they're in the theme. The theme is "neutron stars and their variants (including hypothetical ones)". So:

- pulsar (neutron star) → 10.

- quark star is an example (hypothetical) → but it's an example, so candidates that are hypothetical variants might get points.

Looking at candidates:

Candidate 5: wormhole is hypothetical but not a variant → 0.

Candidate 8: cosmic string is hypothetical but not a variant → 0.

Candidate 1: black hole is not a variant → 0.

So still 10 and 0s. 

Perhaps the user expects some candidates to be in the middle. Let me think again. Maybe the theme is "stellar remnants with extreme properties (density, magnetic field, etc.)", so:

- neutron stars (examples) have high density and magnetars have high magnetic fields.

- pulsars have strong fields but maybe less than magnetars → maybe 9?

- quark stars are hypothetical but also extreme → but not a candidate.

- Other candidates like black holes are excluded.

But pulsar is a neutron star, so 10. Maybe the user expects that.

Alternatively, the theme could be "objects that are remnants of supernova explosions that are not black holes". Then:

- neutron stars (including pulsars, magnetars, quark stars) → yes.

- pulsar is a neutron star → 10.

- others are 0.

Hmm. I think I have to go with that. The scores would be:

1. Black hole → 0

2. Gravitational lensing → 0

3. Dark matter → 0

4. Pulsar → 10

5. Wormhole → 0

6. Quasar → 0

7. Accretion disk → 0

8. Cosmic string → 0

But the user wants the full range. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I should consider that some candidates are related but not exact.

Wait, candidate 7: accretion disk. It's around a neutron star or black hole. But it's not the remnant itself. Maybe a 1?

Candidate 8: cosmic string is hypothetical but not a remnant → 1?

Candidate 5: wormhole hypothetical but not related → 0.

Candidate 2: gravitational lensing → 0.

Candidate 3: dark matter → 0.

Candidate 6: quasar → 0.

Candidate 1: black hole →0.

Candidate 4: pulsar →10.

That gives some variation. So pulsar 10, accretion disk 1, cosmic string 1. The rest 0.

But the user said to use the full range. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "objects that are remnants of massive stars, not black holes". So:

- neutron stars (pulsars, magnetars, quark stars) → yes.

- white dwarfs are remnants but less dense, so excluded.

- pulsar is a neutron star → 10.

- other candidates: 0.

But no.

Alternatively, the theme is "dense objects that are not black holes". So:

- neutron stars (including pulsars, magnetars, quark stars) → yes.

- white dwarfs are dense but less so, maybe 5?

But they aren't in the examples. Since the examples are neutron stars and quark stars (hypothetical), white dwarfs are excluded.

Hmm. I think I need to proceed with the initial assessment, even if it results in many 0s and one 10. The user might expect that. Let me check the instructions again.

The user says the anti-examples are part of a broader theme but not the specific one. So the specific theme must exclude them. The examples are all neutron star variants. Thus:

1. Black hole → 0

2. Gravitational lensing → 0

3. Dark matter →0

4. Pulsar →10

5. Wormhole →0

6. Quasar →0

7. Accretion disk →0

8. Cosmic string →0

But the user wants the full range. Maybe I should assign some mid-scores for candidates that are related but not exact. For example, pulsar is 10. What about quark star is an example but it's hypothetical. If there were a candidate like "quark star", it would be 10. Since it's already in examples, but the candidates don't have it.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "hypothetical or observed dense stellar remnants beyond white dwarfs". Then:

- pulsar (neutron star) →10.

- quark star is an example (hypothetical), but not a candidate.

- cosmic string is hypothetical but not a remnant →1.

- wormhole hypothetical but not →0.

- black hole is a remnant but excluded →0.

- accretion disk is structure →0.

- dark matter →0.

- gravitational lensing →0.

- quasar →0.

So pulsar 10, cosmic string 1, others 0. But the user wants full range. Maybe cosmic string 2? Or another.

Alternatively, candidate 5: wormhole is hypothetical and a structure, maybe 1.

Candidate 8: cosmic string hypothetical and structure →1.

Candidate 1: black hole 0.

Candidate 7: accretion disk → maybe 1 because it's around a neutron star?

But the theme is the object itself, not its surroundings. So no.

Hmm. I think I'll proceed with pulsar as 10 and others 0, but maybe the user expects some other scores. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that magnetars are a subset of neutron stars, so pulsars are also a subset. Maybe other candidates are also neutron stars?

Wait, candidate 4 is pulsar, which is a neutron star. So that's 10.

Candidate 7: accretion disk is around a neutron star but isn't the object itself →0.

Candidate 1: black hole is a different remnant →0.

Candidate 8: cosmic string is a different object →0.

Okay, I think I'll proceed with that.
