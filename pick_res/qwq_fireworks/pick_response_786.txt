Okay, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are:

1. Walrus skin boat launching by Chukchi.
2. Seal hunting rituals by Yupik before the hunt.
3. Narwhal tusk in ceremonial exchanges among Inuvialuit.

Looking at these, they all involve Arctic Indigenous peoples (Chukchi, Yupik, Inuvialuit) and their practices related to specific marine mammals (walrus, seal, narwhal). The activities are ceremonies or rituals directly connected to hunting or using parts of these animals, which are central to their culture and subsistence.

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. Reindeer rituals in Sami culture (Sami are in the Arctic too, but reindeer herding vs. marine mammals).
2. Salmon in Pacific Northwest ceremonies (different region, different animal, but still ceremonial use).
3. Buffalo in Great Plains (again, different region, terrestrial animal, but ceremonial use).

The key difference here is that the specific theme seems to focus on marine mammals (walrus, seal, narwhal) used in ceremonies by Arctic Indigenous groups. The anti-examples involve other animals (reindeer, salmon, buffalo) from different regions or different contexts (like herding vs. hunting).

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Ceremonial use of eagle feathers in Plains Indian cultures.**
   - Plains Indians are a different region (not Arctic), and eagle feathers are birds, not marine mammals. So this is similar to anti-examples. Score low, maybe 1-3.

2. **Ceremonial use of bear claws in some Native American tribes.**
   - Bears are terrestrial, not marine. Different animal, different region. Score low, maybe 2.

3. **Traditional fishing techniques used by Polynesian peoples.**
   - Polynesians are in the Pacific, but techniques vs. specific ceremonies with marine mammals. Not exactly the same. Maybe 2-3.

4. **Traditional dances involving animal costumes in various cultures.**
   - Too broad. The examples are specific to marine mammals and ceremonies. This is general. Score low, maybe 1.

5. **Ceremonial use of feathers in Native American rituals.**
   - Again, feathers are different from marine mammals, and Native American (not specifically Arctic). Similar to anti-examples. Maybe 2-3.

6. **Annual fishing festivals in coastal communities.**
   - Festivals are broader, not specific to ceremonies with marine mammal parts. Maybe 3-4.

7. **Use of animal symbols in totem poles by Pacific Northwest tribes.**
   - Pacific Northwest uses salmon in anti-examples. Totem poles might include eagles or bears. Not marine mammals like walrus or narwhal. Score similar to anti-examples. Maybe 3.

8. **Use of whale bones in ceremonial dances by the Inuit people.**
   - Inuit are Arctic, whale is a marine mammal, used in ceremonies. This matches the specific theme. Should be high, maybe 8-9.

Wait, but the examples include narwhal tusks, walrus boats, seal hunting rituals. Whale bones by Inuit is close. The Inuit are part of the same cultural group as Inuvialuit, so this is a strong match. So maybe 9?

Let me check again:

The theme is Arctic Indigenous groups using marine mammals in specific ceremonies. The anti-examples are either non-marine (reindeer, buffalo) or different regions (Pacific Northwest with salmon, which is a fish but not a mammal). 

Candidate 8 is whale bones (marine mammal) by Inuit (Arctic). That's a direct hit. So 10? Wait, but the examples didn't mention whale bones, but narwhal tusk, seal hunting, walrus boat. Whale is another marine mammal, so maybe 9? Because it's a different species but same category. 

Alternatively, if the theme is specifically about the specific practices (like launching boats, hunting rituals, ceremonial exchanges), then whale bones in dances might be a bit different. But the main elements are Arctic, marine mammal, ceremonial. So probably a 9 or 10. Since the examples include different uses (ceremonial exchanges, rituals before hunt, launching), the whale bones in dance is a ceremony using a marine mammal part. So maybe 9.

Now the other candidates:

1. Eagle feathers, Plains: Not Arctic, not marine. 1.

2. Bear claws: Terrestrial, not Arctic. 1.

3. Polynesian fishing techniques: Techniques vs. ceremony. 2.

4. Animal costumes: Too general. 0?

Wait, the anti-examples include "rituals involving reindeer" which is specific, but the theme's examples are rituals/ceremonies with marine mammals. So maybe 4 is too general, so 1.

5. Feathers in rituals: Not marine mammals. 1.

6. Fishing festivals: Coastal but not specific to marine mammals' parts. Maybe 3.

7. Totem poles with animal symbols: Pacific Northwest, which is anti-example region. Even if the animal is a marine mammal, but the anti-example uses salmon (fish). If the totem uses orcas or whales, then maybe higher? But the candidate says "animal symbols" which could be any. Since the anti-example is about salmon, which is fish, maybe this is similar but not matching. So 3.

So final scores:

1. 1

2. 1

3. 2

4. 1

5. 1

6. 3

7. 3

8. 9
