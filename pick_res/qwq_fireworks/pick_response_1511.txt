Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The three examples provided are all about scientific discoveries that were initially dismissed by newspapers as hoaxes. 

Looking at the examples:

1. Ozone hole discovery in the 1980s dismissed as a hoax by newspapers.
2. X-rays by Roentgen in 1895 dismissed by newspapers.
3. Wright brothers' flight in 1903 reported as a hoax.

The key elements here are:
- A scientific discovery or breakthrough.
- The discovery was made public.
- Newspapers initially dismissed it as a hoax.

Now, the anti-examples are supposed to not fit the exact theme but a broader one. Let's see those:

1. Cold fusion controversy (1989) – involved scientific controversy but not necessarily newspapers calling it a hoax.
2. Continental drift dismissed by scientists, not newspapers.
3. Cosmic microwave background radiation controversy – again, scientific debate but not media dismissing it as a hoax.

So the specific theme is: **A scientific discovery that was initially reported as a hoax by newspapers.** The anti-examples involve scientific controversies but not the media's role in dismissing it as a hoax.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. **Exoplanet 51 Pegasi b (1995) controversy**: I recall that this discovery was actually groundbreaking and met with some skepticism, but was it dismissed by newspapers as a hoax? Not sure. Need to think. Maybe some skepticism in the scientific community, but not necessarily newspapers calling it a hoax. So maybe a low score.

2. **Neutrino discovery (1956)**: The neutrino was theorized earlier, and Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan detected it. There might have been skepticism, but again, was it newspapers dismissing it as a hoax? Probably more scientific skepticism, so not matching the exact theme.

3. **DNA structure by Watson and Crick (1953)**: Their model was controversial, especially with Rosalind Franklin's data, but the media's role? I think the controversy was more within the scientific community. Not sure if newspapers called it a hoax. Maybe a low score.

4. **Marshall and Warren on stomach ulcers (1980s)**: Their claim that bacteria (H. pylori) caused ulcers was initially met with disbelief. The prompt says newspapers dismissed their findings as a hoax. If that's accurate, this fits exactly the theme. So a high score, maybe 10? Wait, but the example uses "dismissed as a hoax by newspapers." If that's the case, then yes, this matches perfectly.

5. **First heart transplant by Barnard (1967)**: There was skepticism, but the heart transplant was a major event. I think it was more about ethical concerns or medical skepticism rather than newspapers calling it a hoax. So maybe mid-range?

6. **Initial skepticism about black holes (early 20th century)**: The concept came from Einstein's equations, but the term "black hole" and acceptance took time. However, this was among scientists, not newspapers. So not matching the theme.

7. **Cloning before Dolly (1996)**: There was skepticism in the scientific community about cloning mammals, but newspapers didn't dismiss prior attempts as hoaxes. The media might have been excited about Dolly, but before that, maybe not. So low score.

8. **Quark discovery (1964)**: Gell-Mann proposed quarks, but they were theoretical. The term "quark" came from him, and acceptance took time. The skepticism was scientific, not media dismissing it as a hoax. So low score.

Now, assigning scores:

1. Exoplanet: Maybe 2. There might have been some controversy, but not the media hoax angle. 
2. Neutrino: 1. The discovery was confirmed and accepted after some time, but not as a hoax by newspapers.
3. DNA: 1. The paper was published in Nature, so media might not have dismissed it as a hoax. 
4. Stomach ulcers: 10? Wait, the examples all have newspapers dismissing as hoaxes. The candidate says "many newspapers dismissed their findings as a hoax." So this matches exactly. So 10. But wait, looking at the anti-examples, the initial dismissal of continental drift was by scientists, not media. So this is a perfect match. So 10.
5. Heart transplant: Maybe 3. Some skepticism but not hoax by media. Maybe media covered it as a breakthrough but with ethical questions. Not hoax.
6. Black holes: 0. Purely scientific skepticism.
7. Cloning: 1. Before Dolly, maybe some skepticism in science but not media calling it hoax.
8. Quarks: 0. Again, scientific debate, not media.

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Maybe adjust some. Let me think again.

Wait, candidate 4 is a perfect match, so 10. 

Candidate 5: The first heart transplant was a big deal. Christiaan Barnard's surgery in 1967 was widely reported. I think there was skepticism, but was it dismissed as a hoax? Probably not. More like questions about ethics or success, but not hoax. So maybe 2 or 3.

Candidate 1: Exoplanet 51 Pegasi b was the first exoplanet around a main-sequence star. There might have been some initial doubt, but I don't recall newspapers calling it a hoax. So maybe 1 or 2.

Candidate 2: Neutrino detection in 1956 by Reines and Cowan. The neutrino was a theoretical particle. Their experiment confirmed it, but was there media dismissing it as a hoax? Unlikely. More like scientific validation. So 0 or 1.

Candidate 3: DNA structure. The paper was published in Nature, so media might have covered it, but the controversy was more about the use of Rosalind Franklin's data. Not hoax by newspapers. So 0 or 1.

Candidate 7: Cloning before Dolly. Prior attempts like frogs in the 70s, but those were in labs. Public or newspapers didn't dismiss them as hoaxes. Maybe skepticism in science, so 0 or 1.

Candidate 8: Quarks. Theoretical, so media probably didn't cover it much, so 0.

Wait, but the user wants to avoid 0s and 10s only. Need to distribute scores more. Let me adjust again:

4 is 10. 

For others, maybe:

1. Exoplanet: Maybe 3. Some minor controversy but not hoax by media.

2. Neutrino: 2. Maybe some initial doubts but not hoax.

3. DNA: 1. Minimal media involvement in hoax.

5. Heart transplant: 3. Maybe some media skepticism but not hoax.

6. Black holes: 1. Since it's early 20th century, maybe newspapers didn't cover it much, so 0, but to avoid 0, maybe 1.

7. Cloning: 1.

8. Quark: 0 or 1. Let's say 1.

Wait, but need to use the full range. Maybe:

1. 3

2. 2

3. 1

4. 10

5. 3

6. 0 → but need to use 0-10. Maybe 1?

Wait, the user said to use the full range. Let me see again.

Alternatively, maybe some candidates are closer. For example:

Candidate 5: The first heart transplant was a huge event. Maybe some newspapers were excited, but skepticism was more about ethics or the procedure's success. Not hoax. So 2.

Candidate 6: Black hole skepticism was among scientists, so 0.

Candidate 7: Cloning before Dolly: maybe some media stories but not dismissing as hoax. 1.

Candidate 8: Quarks: 0.

But to spread the scores, perhaps:

1. 3

2. 2

3. 1

4. 10

5. 3

6. 1

7. 1

8. 0 → but 0 is allowed. The user said to use 0-10.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 6 could be 2, if there was any media mention, but unlikely. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 5's score is 3, others as above.

Final scores:

1. 3

2. 2

3. 1

4. 10

5. 3

6. 1

7. 1

8. 0

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be as per the exact theme. Let me confirm each again.

Candidate 4 is a perfect match, so 10.

Others:

1. Exoplanet: No, so low.

2. Neutrino: 0 or 1.

3. DNA: 0 or 1.

5. Heart: Maybe 2.

6. Black holes: 0.

7. Cloning: 0 or 1.

8. Quark: 0.

But to use the full range, perhaps:

Candidate 5: 3 because there was some skepticism but not hoax.

Candidate 1: 2.

Candidate 2: 1.

Candidate 3: 1.

Candidate 6: 0.

Candidate 7: 1.

Candidate 8: 0.

Hmm. Maybe that's better.

Final scores:

1. 2

2. 1

3. 1

4. 10

5. 3

6. 0

7. 1

8. 0

But need to ensure no 0s and 10s only? Wait the user said "use the full range of possible scores (0, 1, 2,...10)". So including 0 is okay as long as there are some.

Alternatively, perhaps some candidates are mid.

Wait, candidate 5's heart transplant: maybe the skepticism was more about whether it was possible or ethical, but not called a hoax. So maybe 2.

Candidate 1's exoplanet: maybe some media coverage but not dismissing as hoax. 2.

Candidate 2 neutrino: 1.

Candidate 3 DNA: 1.

Candidate 6 black holes: 0.

Candidate 7 cloning: 1.

Candidate 8 quark: 0.

So:

1. 2

2. 1

3. 1

4. 10

5. 2

6. 0

7. 1

8. 0

Alternatively, maybe candidate 5 is a 3 because it's a medical breakthrough with some media attention but not hoax dismissal.

Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. Let's proceed with the initial thought, assigning:

1. 3

2. 2

3. 1

4. 10

5. 3

6. 1

7. 1

8. 0

But since the user wants nuanced scores, maybe:

Candidate 6: 0 is okay, as it's purely scientific.

Candidate 8: 0.

Thus, final scores as per that.
