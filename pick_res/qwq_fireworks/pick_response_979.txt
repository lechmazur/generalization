Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples: scrying bowl, black mirror, crystal ball. All three are objects traditionally used for divination or seeing visions, right? They're all items that people use to scry, which is the practice of looking into a reflective surface to receive messages or visions. So the common theme here is divination tools specifically used for scrying, which typically involve a smooth or reflective surface where visions might be perceived.

Now, the anti-examples are Ouija board, tarot cards, and crystal skull. These are related to divination but aren't scrying tools. Ouija boards are for communicating with spirits via a planchette, tarot cards use symbolism in card layouts, and crystal skulls are more symbolic or mystical objects rather than tools for direct vision. So the key difference is that the main theme is specifically about scrying tools, not just any divination method.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. **Crystal pendant**: A pendant is worn, maybe for protection or energy, but not typically used for scrying. Unless someone holds it up to look into it, but that's not common. So maybe a 3? Not exactly a scrying tool but has crystal, which is part of the examples.

2. **Crystal pyramid**: Pyramids are often used for energy work or display. If it's a clear quartz pyramid, maybe someone could use it to focus energy, but not sure if it's used for scrying. Maybe a 4? Not sure if it's a traditional scrying tool.

3. **Magic wand**: Wands are used in magic for directing energy, spellcasting. Not for scrying. So probably a 2. Unless in some traditions, but not the main use.

4. **Crystal cluster**: A group of crystals, used for energy fields. Not for looking into. Maybe a 2. It's a crystal but not a scrying object.

5. **Pendulum**: Pendulums are used for dowsing or yes/no answers. That's a form of divination, but not scrying. So maybe a 4? It's a tool but not for visions.

6. **Amulet**: Protective charm, worn or carried. Not for scrying. Maybe a 1. Not related except maybe material, but function is different.

7. **Runes**: Like tarot, they're symbols read for divination. Not scrying. So a 2. Again, similar to anti-examples.

8. **Obsidian disk**: Obsidian is a crystal, and a disk shape. A black mirror is an example, so a disk made of obsidian might be used like a scrying mirror. That could be a 7 or 8? Since it's a dark, reflective surface like a black mirror. Maybe 7, because it's similar but depends on how it's used. If it's a flat disk, maybe yes.

Wait, let me reassess:

Scrying tools are items where you look into or at a surface to see visions. So crystal ball (clear sphere), black mirror (dark, reflective), scrying bowl (bowl of water or dark surface). So obsidian disk is like a black mirror, so that's a strong candidate. Maybe 8? But maybe not as traditional as the examples. Hmm.

Crystal pendant: Maybe someone could use it to focus, but not a surface. 3.

Crystal pyramid: Maybe placed under light to project light, but not a surface. 4.

Magic wand: 2.

Crystal cluster: 2.

Pendulum: 4, since it's a tool but different method.

Amulet: 1.

Runes: 2.

Obsidian disk: 8? Because it's a reflective surface, similar to black mirror. Alternatively, maybe 7 if it's not as common. Maybe 7.

Wait, the examples are scrying bowl (like a bowl, maybe water), black mirror, and crystal ball. So the obsidian disk is a flat, dark surface, like a black mirror. So that's a direct match. So maybe 8 or 9. But maybe the examples are more specific: crystal ball is a sphere, scrying bowl is a bowl, black mirror is a mirror. So an obsidian disk would be similar to a black mirror, so 9? Hmm. Maybe 8 because it's a disk instead of a mirror, but still close.

Alternatively, maybe 7 because it's not as traditional? Not sure. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe crystal pendant is a 3 because crystal but not for scrying. Crystal pyramid: 4. Obsidian disk: 8.

Pendulum is a tool for divination but not scrying, so 4. Amulet is 1. Runes 2. Magic wand 2. Crystal cluster 2.

So the scores would be:

1. 3

2.4

3.2

4.2

5.4

6.1

7.2

8.8

Wait, but I need to make sure the scores are spread out. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the obsidian disk is a 9? Since it's directly a dark, reflective surface like the black mirror. So 9.

Hmm, perhaps the user expects that. Let me think again.

The examples are scrying items: bowl, mirror, crystal ball. The obsidian disk as a black mirror is exactly like the black mirror example. So 10? Wait, but the user says anti-examples are things that follow broader themes. But since obsidian disk is exactly like the black mirror, maybe it's a 10? But the user's anti-examples are things like tarot, which are different. Wait, but the user says the anti-examples are not part of the specific theme. So if obsidian disk is a black mirror, then it's a perfect example, so 10? But maybe the examples are specific types. The black mirror is an example, so obsidian disk would be a 10. But maybe the user considers "disk" vs "mirror" as different. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe "black mirror" is a specific term for a type of scrying tool, so an obsidian disk used as a mirror would be a 10. But perhaps the user wants the exact examples, so maybe the obsidian disk is a 9. Alternatively, maybe 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's see the original examples: scrying bowl, black mirror, crystal ball. The obsidian disk is a black mirror, so it's exactly matching. So 10. But the user might have intended that the anti-examples are things that are similar but not exact. Wait, but the obsidian disk is an exact example. Wait, but the user's anti-examples are things like Ouija board, which are divination but not scrying. So if obsidian disk is a scrying tool, it's a 10. But maybe the user wants to avoid giving 10 unless it's exactly like the examples. Since the examples are three distinct items, perhaps the obsidian disk is a 9? Hmm. Maybe the user is cautious. Alternatively, I'll go with 8 to be safe.

Wait, but let me think again. If the theme is "tools used for scrying via reflective surfaces or crystal balls", then obsidian disk is exactly that. So maybe 10? But the user might have intended that the examples are the only ones, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to see that the obsidian disk is a direct match. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user considers "disk" as a different form. The black mirror is a mirror, which is flat. A disk is a flat surface, so same as mirror. So 10. But perhaps the user wants to avoid 10s except for exact matches. Since the examples are three different types, perhaps the obsidian disk is a 9? Maybe. Alternatively, maybe 8.

Alternatively, let me consider other candidates:

Crystal pendant: crystal but not for scrying. 3.

Crystal pyramid: maybe used as a scrying tool? Not typically, so 4.

Magic wand: 2.

Crystal cluster: 2.

Pendulum: 4 (since it's a divination tool but not scrying).

Amulet: 1.

Runes: 2.

Obsidian disk: 8 or 9.

Hmm. To spread the scores, maybe:

1. Crystal pendant: 3

2. Crystal pyramid: 4

3. Magic wand: 2

4. Crystal cluster: 2

5. Pendulum: 4

6. Amulet: 1

7. Runes: 2

8. Obsidian disk: 8

Wait, but maybe the obsidian disk is 9. Let me check again. The examples are scrying items. The obsidian disk is a black mirror, so exactly like one of the examples. So it should be a 10? But the user says not to use 10s except for best matches. The examples are the best matches, so maybe the obsidian disk is a 10. But maybe the user thinks that "disk" is not exactly a mirror. Hmm. Alternatively, since the examples include "black mirror", the obsidian disk is exactly that, so 10. But maybe the user considers "disk" as a different form. Maybe I should go with 9.

Alternatively, since the user's examples are three distinct items, and the obsidian disk is a variation of one (black mirror), maybe it's 9. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe 8.

Alternatively, let me see the other candidates. The pendulum is a 4 because it's a divination tool but not scrying. So maybe the obsidian disk is 9. So I'll go with that.

So the scores would be:

1. 3

2.4

3.2

4.2

5.4

6.1

7.2

8.9

Wait, but I have to make sure the scores are spread. Let me check again:

Crystal pendant (3), crystal pyramid (4), magic wand (2), crystal cluster (2), pendulum (4), amulet (1), runes (2), obsidian disk (9). That seems okay. Alternatively, maybe the crystal pyramid is a 5? Because pyramids can be used for scrying? Not sure. Maybe not. Maybe 4 is okay.

Alternatively, maybe the crystal pendant is a 2 instead of 3. Hmm. Well, I think I'll proceed with these scores.
