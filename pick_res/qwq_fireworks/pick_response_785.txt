Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the examples (magnetic compass, Kamal, portolan charts) share. The anti-examples (chronometer, marine chronometer, sextant) are supposed to be related but not exact matches.

Looking at the examples: Magnetic compass is a navigational tool for direction. Kamal is an ancient navigational tool used in Islamic navigation to measure the angle of stars. Portolan charts are detailed nautical maps used for navigation. So they all are tools or instruments directly used for navigation at sea, specifically for determining direction or location.

Now the anti-examples: Chronometer and marine chronometer are timekeeping devices crucial for determining longitude. Sextant is a more advanced angle-measuring tool used with celestial navigation. These are also navigation tools but perhaps more related to timekeeping or precise measurement for longitude, which might be a broader category. The theme might be specifically pre-chronometer navigation tools? Because the anti-examples include chronometers, which were developed later to solve the longitude problem, whereas the original examples are earlier tools like Kamal and portolan charts which don't rely on precise time.

So the specific theme is likely older, pre-chronometer navigation instruments and tools used for direction and basic navigation, not involving timekeeping for longitude. 

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. Quadrant: An instrument for measuring angles, like the astrolabe. Used in celestial navigation. But similar to the sextant (anti-example), but maybe older? The Kamal and astrolabe are in the examples. So maybe a 7 or 8? Wait, but the anti-examples include sextant, which is a more advanced angle measurer. So maybe quadrant is okay?

2. Mercator projection maps: These are a type of nautical chart, similar to portolan charts. Portolan charts are the example, so Mercator would be a match. Maybe a 9 or 10? But wait, Mercator is a specific type of map projection, which is more technical. Portolan charts are actual maps used for navigation. So maybe a 9?

3. Astrolabe: Definitely an older navigation tool for measuring the angle of stars. The Kamal is in the examples, so Astrolabe is similar. Probably a 10?

4. Sonar: Used for depth and detecting underwater objects. Not directly for direction or navigation like the examples. More about underwater detection. So maybe a 2 or 3?

5. Gyroscopic compass: A modern compass that uses gyroscopes to maintain direction. The original examples include magnetic compass, but this is a different technology. Since the anti-examples include more modern instruments (chronometers), maybe this is a 5 or 6? It's a compass but modern, so maybe not part of the specific theme.

6. Echo sounder: Similar to sonar, used for depth measurement. Not navigation direction, so low score like 1 or 2?

7. Cross-staff: Another angle measuring tool, like the Kamal. The Kamal is an example, so cross-staff would be a 9 or 10?

8. Inertial navigation system: A modern system using accelerometers and gyroscopes. Definitely post-chronometer technology. So a 0 or 1?

Wait, but need to make sure. Let me check again:

Examples: Magnetic compass (direction), Kamal (angle measurement for latitude), portolan charts (maps for navigation). These are all pre-18th century tools, before the chronometer solved longitude. The anti-examples include chronometer (for time), marine chronometer, and sextant (which uses time and angles for longitude). So the theme is pre-chronometer navigation tools (direction, basic maps, simple angle measurements). 

So candidates:

1. Quadrant: Older angle measurement tool. Yes, so maybe 8 or 9. But Kamal is a simple tool, quadrant is more precise. Maybe 7?

2. Mercator projection: Mercator was developed in 16th century, portolan charts are earlier. But Mercator maps are still nautical charts, so a strong match. 9?

3. Astrolabe: Yes, definitely. 10.

4. Sonar: Not navigation for direction, so 1.

5. Gyroscopic compass: Modern tech, so 4?

6. Echo sounder: Depth, so 1.

7. Cross-staff: Like Kamal, used for latitude. 9.

8. Inertial navigation: Modern, 0.

Hmm, but let's see if there's any nuance. The inertial navigation system is a 20th-century technology, so definitely not. The gyroscopic compass is a 20th-century improvement over magnetic compass, so maybe 3? The cross-staff and quadrant are older, so they should be higher. Mercator is a map, so same as portolan. Astrolabe is a top. 

So the scores:

1. Quadrant: 8 (since it's similar to Kamal and astrolabe, but maybe not as directly as cross-staff)

2. Mercator: 9

3. Astrolabe: 10

4. Sonar: 1

5. Gyroscopic compass: 3 (since it's a compass but modern)

6. Echo sounder: 1

7. Cross-staff: 9

8. Inertial: 0

Wait but let me check cross-staff vs quadrant. Cross-staff was used by sailors, similar to Kamal. Quadrant might be more land-based? Or maybe both are sea tools. Maybe cross-staff is higher. Astrolabe is better than quadrant. So maybe:

Quadrant: 7, cross-staff 9. Mercator 9. 

Gyroscopic compass: maybe 2 or 3. 

Yes, that seems better.
