Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are a gel stress ball, a spring-loaded door stopper, and a retractable pen. All of these have something in common: when you apply force (squeezing, stepping, clicking), they deform or change shape, but when the force is removed or the action is reversed (releasing, stepping off, clicking again), they go back to their original shape. So the key here is that they exhibit reversible deformation—they return to their original state after the force is removed.

Now, looking at the anti-examples: the metal that stays changed after cooling, clay that doesn't return, and plastic that remains bent. These all don't revert to their original shape once deformed. The anti-examples are about materials that undergo permanent deformation or phase changes that aren't reversible under normal conditions. So the specific theme must be about materials or objects that can reversibly deform and return to their original state when the deforming force is removed.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. **Metal spring that doesn't return if overstretched**: Normally, springs return unless overstretched. But the key here is that if overstretched, it doesn't. However, under normal use (within limits), it would. But the description says "does not return to its original length if overstretched." Since the theme requires returning when released, but this only fails under overstretching, maybe it's a partial match. But the question is whether the candidate as a whole fits. Since the spring can return normally but not when overstretched, but the theme is about the general behavior. Maybe it's a 3 because it's conditional.

2. **Memory foam pillow**: Memory foam does contour and return. Even though it's a different mechanism (viscoelastic), it does return to original shape when pressure is removed. So this is a strong match. Probably a 7 or 8. Wait, the examples include spring and gel, which are elastic. Memory foam is a bit different (time-dependent), but the key is it returns. So maybe a 7 because it's similar but not exactly the same mechanism?

3. **Candle that melts and doesn't return**: Melting is a phase change. When cooled, it solidifies but not to original shape. So it's a clear anti-example. 0 or 1. Since it's a phase change and doesn't return, maybe 1 because maybe someone might think it's reversible, but no, the theme requires returning to original shape upon release, which the candle doesn't.

4. **Paper that stays crumpled**: Doesn't return, so anti-example. 0 or 1. Since it's a clear non-return, 0.

5. **Wooden plank that bends but doesn't return**: Permanent deformation. Anti-example. 0.

6. **Glass that shatters**: Doesn't return. 0.

7. **Metal wire that bends and stays**: Permanent, so 0.

8. **Ice melting**: Phase change, can't return to original shape (as ice). So it's a phase change, so 0. But wait, when you melt ice, it becomes water, but if you refreeze, it can become ice again but not the original shape. So similar to the candle. So 0 or 1. Since the process isn't reversible without external force (freezing), it's a 0.

Wait, let's go back to candidate 2. Memory foam does return to its original shape when the pressure is removed, even if it takes some time. The examples include things that return immediately (spring, stress ball), but memory foam's return is slower. However, the theme is about returning, not the speed. So maybe it's a 9 or 10? Hmm, but the anti-examples include things that don't return. So memory foam does return, so it should be a high score. The examples use elastic deformation (spring, gel, retractable pen's mechanism). Memory foam is viscoelastic, but still returns. Maybe a 9? Or 8?

Wait the original examples are all mechanical reversible deformation. The stress ball deforms when squeezed and returns when released. The spring door stopper compresses and springs back. The pen retracts with a click. These are all immediate and elastic. Memory foam is more about slowly returning, but still does return. So maybe it's a 7 because it's similar but not exactly the same mechanism. The theme might be "reversible deformation upon removal of force", so memory foam fits that, so maybe 8?

Hmm. Let's see the anti-examples: the metal that changes shape when heated but stays—so that's a phase change or plastic deformation. The clay doesn't return, plastic deformation. The plastic toy stays bent, so plastic deformation. The theme is about elastic deformation (spring-like), so materials that can undergo elastic deformation and return. Memory foam is viscoelastic, so it's a bit different but still returns. So maybe a 7.

Candidate 1: The metal spring normally returns, but if overstretched, it doesn't. The question is, does the candidate as a whole fit the theme? Since the spring can return under normal use, but the description specifies that it "does not return... if overstretched." The theme is about the general behavior. So maybe it's a 3 because it's a spring that can return, but the wording implies that it can fail to return under certain conditions. But the theme is about the object's inherent property. Since the spring is designed to return, but when overstretched (beyond its elastic limit), it doesn't. So maybe the candidate is a spring that's been overstretched, so it's a failed example. But the description says "a metal spring that compresses when weight is applied but does not return..." So perhaps it's a spring that is now in a state where it can't return, so it's a broken spring. So it's an anti-example. Wait, but the first part says "compresses when weight is applied"—so maybe it can still compress, but won't return? That would mean it's in a plastic deformation state. So it doesn't return when released. So that's an anti-example. Wait, but the first example is a spring-loaded door stopper which does return. So this spring doesn't, so it's an anti-example. So maybe 0? But the question says the anti-examples are the ones that don't match the specific theme. Wait, the first candidate is a spring that doesn't return when overstretched. The theme is about objects that do return when released. So this spring, when overstretched, doesn't return. But maybe under normal use, it does. The description is ambiguous. The way it's phrased is that the spring "does not return to its original length if overstretched." But the question is whether the candidate as a whole fits the theme. If the spring can return under normal use, but not when overstretched, then it's still a valid example of the theme because the theme is about the object's normal behavior. However, the way the candidate is phrased might imply that it's a spring that, in general, doesn't return. Hmm, tricky. Maybe a 3 because it's partially a match but has a condition where it fails.

Alternatively, perhaps the candidate is a spring that, even under normal use, doesn't return. But the description says "compresses when weight is applied but does not return." So maybe it's a spring that's been damaged and can't return, making it an anti-example. Then that would be a 0. But the problem is the wording. Let me re-read: "A metal spring that compresses when weight is applied but does not return to its original length if overstretched." So the "if overstretched" is a condition. So normally, it would return, but if you overstretch it, it won't. So the spring itself is still part of the theme because under normal conditions, it does return. So the candidate is a spring that can return unless overstretched. Therefore, it's still part of the theme. Wait, but the way it's phrased, the spring is described as one that does not return when overstretched. So maybe the candidate is a spring that has been overstretched and is now non-returning. In that case, it's an anti-example. But the description is a bit ambiguous. Hmm. Maybe I should rate it as a 3 because it's a spring that can return under normal use but not when overstretched, so it's partially a match but has a limitation. Alternatively, if the spring is in a state where it doesn't return, then it's a 0. Since the problem is to evaluate based on the specific theme, which requires returning when released, the candidate's description specifies that when overstretched, it doesn't return. But the question is whether the object as a whole fits the theme. Since it can return under normal use, but not when overstretched, perhaps it's still a valid example, so maybe a 7? Or maybe the key is that the theme is about objects that always return when released, so if there's a condition where it doesn't, it's not a perfect match, hence lower score. Maybe 5? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. I'll tentatively go with 3, considering the condition where it doesn't return.

Candidate 2: Memory foam pillow. Returns when pressure is removed, so a strong match. Maybe 8 or 9. Let's say 8.

Candidate 3: Candle melts and doesn't return. 0.

Candidate4: Paper stays crumpled. 0.

Candidate5: Wood bends and stays. 0.

Candidate6: Glass shatters. 0.

Candidate7: Metal wire stays bent. 0.

Candidate8: Ice melts. 0.

Wait, but for candidate 8, ice melting is a phase change. When it melts, it becomes water, but if you cool it again, it becomes ice again but not the original shape. So it's not returning to original shape. So 0.

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 8

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

Wait but maybe candidate2's score is higher. Let me think again. The memory foam does return to original shape when the pressure is removed, so it's exactly like the examples. The examples include a spring (elastic) and a gel (viscoelastic, like stress ball). So memory foam is similar to the stress ball in that it deforms under pressure and returns. So maybe it's a 10? Wait, the examples all return immediately. Memory foam returns slowly, but still does return. The theme is about returning to original shape when released, not the speed. So maybe it's a 10. But the anti-examples are things that don't return. So candidate2 is a perfect match. Hmm, but the original examples are all mechanical, while memory foam is a different type of material. But the key is the return. So maybe 10? But the problem says the anti-examples can match a broader theme but not the specific. The examples are all elastic, so maybe the theme is elastic deformation. Memory foam is viscoelastic, so maybe it's a 9? Because it's similar but not exactly elastic. Alternatively, the theme is just "returns to original shape upon release", so it's a 10. But the first example is a gel stress ball (viscoelastic), so maybe memory foam is exactly fitting. So candidate2 should be 10. But the user said to use the full range. Let me see the anti-examples: the metal that changes shape when heated but stays. That's a phase change or plastic deformation. The clay and plastic toy are plastic deformation. The theme is elastic deformation (spring, gel, retractable pen). Memory foam is viscoelastic, so it's part of the same category (elastic, just with time dependency). So candidate2 is a perfect match. So 10. Then why the initial thought of 8? Maybe overthinking. Let me adjust:

Candidate2: 10.

Candidate1: 3 (since it can return under normal use but not when overstretched, but the description specifies that it does not return when overstretched, which is a condition, so maybe it's a 5?)

Alternatively, if the spring is designed to return normally, then it's a valid example, but the candidate's description includes a condition where it doesn't. Since the theme is about the object's behavior, maybe it's still a valid example except under overstretch. So perhaps 7? Hmm, this is tricky. The problem states that the examples return when released. The candidate's spring can return unless overstretched. The question is whether the candidate as a whole fits the theme. Since the spring can return under normal use, it's still part of the theme. The overstretched condition is an exception. So maybe it's a 7 or 8. Alternatively, if the candidate's description is that it does not return when overstretched, but under normal use it does, then the spring is still a valid example. The theme requires that when you release the force, it returns. So if you don't overstretch, it does. So the candidate is still a valid example. Therefore, maybe 9? But the description includes a condition where it doesn't. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the candidate is a spring that, even under normal use, doesn't return. Wait, the description says "compresses when weight is applied but does not return to its original length if overstretched." So the "if overstretched" is a conditional. So the spring can return normally, but if overstretched, it can't. So the spring itself is still part of the theme, as under normal use it does return. Therefore, it's a valid example, so maybe a 9. But perhaps the mention of the overstretched case makes it a bit less of a perfect match, so 8. Alternatively, since it's a spring, which is exactly like the door stopper example, except with a caveat, maybe 9. Hmm, this is tough. Let's say 7.

Wait, let's compare to the anti-examples. The anti-examples are things that don't return at all. The first candidate here can return under normal use, so it's better than the anti-examples. So it's a 7. Candidate2 is 10. So adjusting:

1. 7

2. 10

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

Wait, but I need to make sure that I'm not overcomplicating. The key is the object returns to original shape when released. Candidate1's spring does that unless overstretched. So the spring is still part of the theme, but with a caveat. The theme doesn't specify that it must always return under any condition, just that when you release it, it returns. So as long as under normal use it does, it's okay. So maybe it's a 10? No, because the description says it doesn't return when overstretched. The problem is whether the candidate's description implies that it's a spring that can't return under normal use. The way it's written: "compresses when weight is applied but does not return... if overstretched." So the "does not return" is conditional on overstretched. So the spring itself is still a normal spring that returns under normal conditions, so it's a perfect example. Therefore, it should be 10? Wait, but the examples include a spring (door stopper). So the first candidate is a spring, so exactly like the example, so 10. But the description adds that it doesn't return when overstretched. But the theme is about the object's normal behavior. Since it can return normally, it's a 10. Then why the initial hesitation? Maybe the description is trying to trick us. The candidate is a spring that does return unless overstretched. Since the theme requires that when you release, it returns, which it does under normal conditions. The overstretched is an edge case, so it's still a valid example. Therefore, 10.

But then why is the anti-example the metal that changes shape when heated but stays? Because that doesn't return at all. So candidate1 is okay. So then:

1. 10

2.10

Wait but maybe the first candidate is a spring that has been overstretched and is now non-returning. The description is ambiguous. The wording says "a metal spring that compresses when weight is applied but does not return to its original length if overstretched." The key is the "if overstretched"—so it's a conditional. The spring can compress and return normally, but if you overstretch it, it won't. Therefore, the spring itself is still part of the theme, so it's a perfect match. So 10. But then why is the first example's door stopper a spring? So the first candidate is the same as an example, so 10. Then candidate2 is also 10. But the user wants the scores to be granular. Maybe there's a difference. The memory foam returns slowly, while the spring is immediate. The theme might require immediate return. The examples: stress ball (immediate), spring (immediate), pen (mechanical, immediate). The memory foam takes time. So maybe it's a 7 because it's a slower return but still returns. So candidate2 is 7, candidate1 is 10. Hmm.

Alternatively, the theme is just that it returns, regardless of speed. So memory foam is 10. Then candidate1 is 10 as well. But the problem says the anti-examples are not exact matches but can match broader themes. The user wants the scores to use the full range, so maybe there's a reason to differentiate. Let me think again.

The first candidate is a spring that returns normally but not when overstretched. The theme is about the object's inherent property of returning when released. Since the spring can return under normal use, it's a perfect example, so 10. The second candidate is memory foam, which also returns when pressure is removed, so also 10. But maybe the user intended that the theme is about elastic deformation (spring-like), so memory foam is viscoelastic, so slightly different, hence 9. Alternatively, the examples include a gel (stress ball), which is viscoelastic, so memory foam is the same category, so 10. So both 1 and 2 get 10. But the user's anti-examples include clay, which is plastic. The examples include the gel, which is elastic. So maybe the theme is elastic deformation (returns when released). Memory foam is elastic (viscoelastic), so yes. The spring is elastic. So both 10.

But the first candidate's description includes a caveat, so maybe it's 9. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me try to resolve this.

The key is the theme is: objects that deform when force is applied and return to original shape when force is released. The examples are all that. The anti-examples are things that don't return. The first candidate's spring does return under normal use, so it fits. The mention of overstretched is an edge case, so it's still a valid example. So 10. The memory foam also fits, so 10. But since the user wants the scores to be spread out, maybe I need to differentiate. Alternatively, perhaps the first candidate's spring is a normal spring, so 10, and the memory foam is also 10, but the user might want lower scores. Alternatively, maybe the first candidate's description is phrased in a way that it's a spring that does not return when overstretched, implying it's in a state where it doesn't return, so it's an anti-example. But the wording is ambiguous. Since the problem says "a metal spring that compresses when weight is applied but does not return to its original length if overstretched." The "if" suggests it's conditional. So the spring is still part of the theme. Thus, 10.

But given the initial examples include a spring (door stopper), which is exactly like the first candidate, except the first candidate's spring can return normally. So same as example, so 10. Memory foam is also same as stress ball, so 10. But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, the first candidate's spring does not return when overstretched, but the theme is about objects that always return when released. So if there's any scenario where it doesn't return, it's not a perfect match, hence lower score. So maybe 7. Because it can return normally, but under some conditions it can't. The theme requires that when you release the force, it returns. So if the force was applied beyond the elastic limit, it won't return. But the theme might require that it always returns under any application of force. Since it can fail, it's a 7.

Candidate2: memory foam returns under normal conditions, so it's a perfect match, 10.

Thus, adjusting:

1.7

2.10

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

This seems better. The first candidate gets a 7 because it can fail under overstretch, but normally works. The memory foam is perfect. The others are 0. That uses the full range (0 and 7, 10). But the user asked to use the full range (0-10). So this works.
