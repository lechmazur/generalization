Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are Robinson Crusoe, Walden, and Into the Wild. Let me think about what these three have in common.

Robinson Crusoe is a classic story about a man stranded on an island, trying to survive and reflect on his life. Walden is Thoreau's account of living simply in nature, emphasizing self-reliance and introspection. Into the Wild is about a man who leaves society to live in the wilderness, exploring themes of solitude and the search for meaning. 

So the common thread here seems to be a focus on solitary experiences in nature, often involving a journey of self-discovery or philosophical reflection. The protagonists are isolated, either by choice or circumstance, and their time in nature leads them to profound personal insights.

Now, the anti-examples are Hatchet, Lord of the Flies, and Life of Pi. Let's see why these don't fit the specific theme. Hatchet is about a boy surviving in the wilderness after a plane crash, but it's more about survival skills and rescue, not deep philosophical reflection. Lord of the Flies is about a group of boys stranded on an island, focusing on societal breakdown and human nature rather than solitude and introspection. Life of Pi has a man stranded at sea, but it's more about spiritual exploration and the nature of reality, which might be broader than the specific theme here. 

So the key differentiators are: the protagonist is alone (or choosing solitude), the setting is nature, and the narrative emphasizes personal growth, introspection, or philosophical themes rather than survival for survival's sake, societal dynamics, or broader existential questions beyond individual reflection.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **The Martian by Andy Weir**: This is about an astronaut stranded on Mars, using ingenuity to survive. It's more about problem-solving and eventual rescue. The main focus is on survival and technical skills, not deep introspection or philosophical musings. So maybe a 4? Not quite the same as the examples because it's more about survival and less about the internal journey.

2. **The Call of the Wild by Jack London**: A dog's story in the Yukon. It's about adaptation and survival in the wild, but the protagonist is an animal, not a human seeking self-discovery. The themes are more about instinct and the law of the wild. So probably a low score, maybe 2? Doesn't fit the human introspection aspect.

3. **Moby-Dick by Herman Melville**: This novel follows Captain Ahab's obsession with a whale. While set in the sea, the themes are more about obsession, fate, and the human condition. The narrator's reflections are part of it, but the central story isn't about solitude in nature for self-discovery. Maybe a 5? There's some philosophical depth but not the solitude and chosen isolation.

4. **The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway**: An old fisherman's struggle at sea. It's a story of perseverance and man vs. nature. The old man is alone, and there's introspection, but the focus is more on the physical struggle and personal pride rather than a journey of self-discovery through solitude. Maybe a 6? Closer because of solitude and introspection but not exactly the same as Walden's deliberate simplicity.

5. **My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George**: A boy runs away to live in the woods, learning survival and finding peace. This seems closer to the examples. The protagonist chooses solitude in nature, learns self-reliance, and has a reflective journey. Maybe an 8? It's similar to Into the Wild but more positive and less tragic, so maybe slightly lower than the examples but still close.

6. **The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett**: A story about children discovering a hidden garden. The garden represents renewal, but the setting isn't about solitary wilderness. It's more about healing and relationships. So probably a 3? Doesn't focus on solitude or introspection as the main theme.

7. **Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens**: A woman raised in the wilderness, isolated, and her story of survival and connection. The protagonist lives alone in nature, has a deep connection with the environment, and there's introspection. This is very close to the examples. Maybe a 9? It's about solitude, nature, and personal growth, similar to Into the Wild but with a stronger narrative of isolation.

8. **The Road by Cormac McCarthy**: A father and son traveling through a post-apocalyptic landscape. While set in a desolate environment, the focus is on their relationship and survival in a harsh world. It's more about human connection and morality in adversity, not solitude or self-discovery alone. So maybe a 5? The setting is harsh nature, but the theme isn't about the individual's introspective journey in solitude.

Wait, let me check again. For The Road, the protagonists are traveling, not isolated. So maybe lower, like 3? Hmm. The anti-examples include Lord of the Flies which is group dynamics, so The Road's focus on a relationship might not fit. 

Wait, the examples are all about individuals (Robinson Crusoe alone, Thoreau alone, Into the Wild's Christopher alone). The Road has a father and son, so they aren't alone, so that's a key difference. So maybe a 1 or 2. But the environment is post-apocalyptic wilderness, but the theme is different. So maybe 2.
