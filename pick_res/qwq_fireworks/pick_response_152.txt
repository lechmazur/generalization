Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the specific theme from the examples given. The three examples all involve some form of mandatory, cyclical rotation through different roles or professions. In Equinox, citizens cycle through all professions regardless of aptitude or preference. Aquatica's citizens undergo genetic changes every five years to take on different roles. The Lumin on Xylos transfer their consciousness into different host bodies every decade to experience various roles. The key elements here are the enforced, periodic rotation through all roles without consideration of personal choice or aptitude, and it's a systemic, structured process.

Now, the anti-examples are meant to show things that are related but not exact matches. The first anti-example is assigning jobs based on aptitude, which is different because it's not a cycle. The second allows petitions for reassignment, which introduces choice, and the third uses social class to dictate careers, which isn't about cycling through roles.

The task is to evaluate each candidate on a scale of 0-10 based on how closely they match the specific theme of mandatory, cyclical role rotation without regard to aptitude or preference, and not just related themes like trying different roles or having some form of role assignment.

Looking at the candidates:

1. **A world where individuals can upload their consciousness into virtual realities to experience different professions.**
   - This allows experiencing roles, but it's optional (they "can" do it) and not a mandatory cycle. It's virtual, so not actual role rotation. So probably a low score, maybe 2-3.

2. **The nomadic K'thali tribes rotate through roles like hunter, weaver, etc., ensuring a shared communal experience.**
   - This seems closer. The description says they rotate throughout their life, which might be cyclical. The examples in the theme have cycles, so this is a strong candidate. Maybe 8-9, but need to check if it's enforced and mandatory. The tribes "believe" in it, so maybe it's a cultural mandate. So maybe 8?

3. **A culture where individuals apprentice in various crafts before choosing a specialization.**
   - This involves trying roles but then choosing one. It's not a cycle through all roles indefinitely. So maybe a 4 or 5, since it's temporary and leads to specialization.

4. **A world where people can swap bodies with others to experience different lives.**
   - Swapping bodies might allow role experience, but again, it's voluntary. The examples are about enforced cycles. So similar to candidate 1, maybe 3.

5. **A culture where individuals are encouraged to try different jobs throughout their lives.**
   - Encouraged but not mandatory. The theme requires enforced cycles regardless of preference. So maybe 4-5.

6. **A society governed by a council of randomly selected citizens.**
   - This is about governance, not role cycling. The selection is random for the council, but not a cycle through all professions. So 0 or 1.

7. **A society where individuals are assigned roles based on their birth order.**
   - Assigned based on birth order, which is deterministic but not cyclical. No rotation. So 0-2.

8. **A world where people inherit their family's trade.**
   - Fixed roles inherited, so no rotation. Definitely 0.

Wait, but let me double-check each candidate against the theme's key points: mandatory, cyclical, through all roles, regardless of aptitude/preference.

Candidate 2: The K'thali rotate through roles throughout their life. The examples have cycles (yearly, every five years, every decade). The K'thali's rotation might not have a fixed period, but it's a cycle through various roles. The key is that they do rotate through all facets, which matches the theme's requirement of cycling through roles. Since it's a cultural mandate (they "believe" in it), it's enforced. So this is very close, maybe a 9? Or 8?

Candidate 5: Encouraged but not mandatory. The examples are strict cycles. So encouragement is less strict. Maybe a 4.

Candidate 1 and 4 allow swapping or virtual experiences, but not enforced cycles. So lower scores.

Candidate 6's random council is unrelated.

So scoring:

1. 3 (voluntary, virtual)
2. 9 (mandatory rotation through roles)
3. 4 (apprenticeship before specialization, not cyclical)
4. 3 (swap bodies, voluntary)
5. 4 (encouraged but not enforced)
6. 1 (random council, no role cycling)
7. 0 (no cycle)
8. 0 (inherited trade, no cycle)

Wait, but let me check again. For candidate 2, the problem is whether they cycle through all roles or just some. The examples mention cycling through "all recognized professions" in Equinox, "various necessary functions" in Aquatica, and "pre-designated host bodies" for different roles in Xylos. The K'thali rotate through roles like hunter, weaver, storyteller, spiritual leader. It says "all facets of their society", so maybe they do go through all key roles. So that's a strong match. Maybe 9.

Candidate 5's encouragement might be a weaker version, so 4. Candidate 3's apprenticeship is temporary, leading to specialization, so 3 or 4. Hmm.

Alternatively, candidate 3 is about trying crafts before choosing, which is a limited trial period, not a cycle. So maybe 3.

Wait the anti-examples include "assigned based on aptitude", which is not cyclical. The candidates need to avoid those. The anti-examples are not exact but related. So the key is that the examples have mandatory, enforced, cyclical rotation through all roles, without choice. So the exact theme is: mandatory, enforced rotation through all roles regardless of personal preference/aptitude, on a set cycle.

So for each candidate:

1. Voluntary upload to virtual professions: 0-3. Since it's not mandatory and not actual roles. 2?

2. Mandatory rotation through roles (nomadic tribes' belief enforced): 9 or 10? Since they rotate through all facets, which might align with "all recognized professions" in Equinox. So 10? But the original examples have specific time cycles (year, five years, decade). The K'thali's rotation is "throughout their life", which might not have a fixed period. But the key is the rotation through roles regardless of choice. Since it's a cultural mandate, maybe 9.

3. Apprenticeship before choosing: Not cyclical, so 3.

4. Body swapping: voluntary, so 3.

5. Encouraged to try different jobs: not mandatory, so 4.

6. Random council: 0.

7. Birth order roles: no cycle, 0.

8. Inherited trade: 0.

Wait candidate 6's council is selected randomly, but the theme is about role cycling. So 0.

Hmm, but candidate 2's score might be 9. Let me see the original examples again. The examples have cycles with fixed periods (year, five years, decade). The K'thali's rotation is "throughout their life" but the exact timing isn't specified. However, the key is that they rotate through all roles, which matches. So 9 is appropriate.

Candidate 5: "encouraged to try different jobs throughout their lives" – encouragement is not enforcement. So maybe 4.

Candidate 3: "apprentice in various crafts before choosing a specialization" – this is a temporary phase, not a cycle. So maybe 3.

So final scores:

1. 2

2. 9

3. 3

4. 2

5. 4

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

Wait, but the user wants to use the full range, so maybe adjust to have more spread. Let me see again.

Alternatively, candidate 1's consciousness upload: maybe a 3 instead of 2. Candidate 4's body swapping is similar, so also 3. Candidate 5's encouragement is 4. Candidate 3's apprenticeship is 3. So:

1. 3

2. 9

3. 3

4. 3

5. 4

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

But perhaps candidate 5 is better than 4? Maybe 5? Or candidate 3 is 4? Hmm, tricky.

Alternatively, candidate 2's score could be 10, but maybe not because it's not explicitly stated to cycle through all roles in a fixed period. The original examples have structured cycles. The K'thali's rotation is "throughout their life" but maybe in a set order or time. The problem says "rotate through roles like hunter, weaver..." implying they go through each role once, but maybe not a cycle. Wait the examples cycle through all roles, so perhaps the K'thali do that. The question is whether it's a cycle (repeating roles) or just going through each once. The original examples have people going through all roles in sequence, possibly once each. For example, in Equinox, they "begin a cycle through all recognized professions" which implies they go through each once in a sequence. So maybe the K'thali's rotation is similar. So that's a strong match, so 10?

Wait the user said anti-examples are not exact but related. So the exact theme is mandatory, enforced rotation through all professions/roles regardless of aptitude/preference, with a set cycle. The K'thali's system seems to fit that exactly, except maybe the cycle duration. Since the problem didn't specify the duration, just that it's a cycle, then yes, so 10. But the examples have specific cycles (year, five years, decade). The K'thali's is "throughout their life", so maybe they do each role once but over their lifetime. So it's a single cycle through all roles, not repeating. That might be a slight difference. The examples might involve repeating cycles (like every year, you rotate). Hmm, the first example says "cycle through all recognized professions, from sanitation worker to Supreme Judge, spending a year in each role regardless of aptitude or preference." So it's a cycle where each role is taken for a year, and presumably after all roles are done, they might start again? Or is it a one-time cycle? The wording says "begin a cycle", implying it's a sequence that they go through once. Wait, that's ambiguous. Maybe the cycle is a single pass through all roles. In that case, the K'thali's approach of rotating through roles throughout their life (maybe once each) would align. So maybe it's a 10. Alternatively, if the examples require repeating cycles, then not. Since the problem's examples may not specify repetition, just a cycle through all roles, then K'thali is a 10.

But since the user's anti-examples include things like "assigned based on aptitude" which are not cycles, the exact theme is the enforced rotation through all roles, regardless of choice. So candidate 2 is a perfect match. So 10.

Then adjusting:

2. 10

But maybe the user's examples have a time-based cycle (each role for a year, etc.), while the K'thali's rotation isn't time-based. Maybe that's a slight difference. So perhaps 9.

Alternatively, the key is the enforced rotation through all roles, not the time aspect. So 10.

Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. To be safe, I'll give 9.

Proceeding with that, then:

1. 3

2. 9

3. 3

4. 3

5. 4

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

Wait, candidate 5: "encouraged to try different jobs". Encouragement isn't mandatory, so lower than 4? Maybe 3.5, but since we need integers, 4 is okay.

Candidate 3: "apprentice in various crafts before choosing a specialization". This is a trial period, but not a cycle through roles. They try multiple but then settle. So maybe 3.

So the scores are as above.
