Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user provided three examples (Rhone, Arno, Ebro) and three anti-examples (Tiber, Garonne, Danube). The task is to figure out the specific theme that the examples share, which the anti-examples don't. Then, evaluate the given candidates on a scale from 0 to 10 based on how well they fit that exact theme, avoiding broader or related themes that the anti-examples might fit.

First, I need to determine the common theme among Rhone, Arno, and Ebro. Let me think about these rivers. 

Rhone is a major river in France and Switzerland. The Arno flows through Florence in Italy. The Ebro is in Spain. Hmm, maybe they all flow into the Mediterranean Sea? Let me check:

- Rhone flows into the Mediterranean.
- Arno flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea (part of the Mediterranean, but maybe that's too specific? Wait, the Tyrrhenian is a sub-basin, but perhaps the user considers the broader Mediterranean. Alternatively, maybe they all are in Europe? Well, all are in Europe, but the anti-examples like Tiber (Italy, Mediterranean), Garonne (France, Atlantic), Danube (Black Sea) are also European except Danube's mouth is the Black Sea. Wait, the Danube flows into the Black Sea, which is connected to the Mediterranean via the Aegean and such, but maybe the theme is strictly Mediterranean?

Alternatively, maybe they all are major rivers in their respective countries but that's too vague. Another angle: The Rhone, Arno, and Ebro might all be rivers that are significant in historical or cultural contexts. Alternatively, their names might have certain linguistic features. Let me think of another angle.

Wait, perhaps they are all rivers that are tributaries of larger rivers? No, the Rhone flows into the Mediterranean, Arno into the Tyrrhenian, Ebro into the Mediterranean as well. Maybe they all have major cities along them? Rhone has Lyon, Arno has Florence, Ebro has Zaragoza. But so do the anti-examples. Tiber has Rome, Garonne has Bordeaux, Danube has Vienna, Budapest, etc. Not sure.

Another thought: Maybe they are all left-bank or right-bank rivers? Not sure. Alternatively, their names might end with a vowel? Rhone (ends with 'e'), Arno (ends with 'o'), Ebro (ends with 'o'). The anti-examples: Tiber (ends with 'r'), Garonne (ends with 'e'), Danube (ends with 'e'). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the first letter? R, A, E – no, that doesn't form a pattern.

Wait, let me think of their flow directions. Rhone flows south, Arno west, Ebro east? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are all in countries that were part of the Roman Empire? Probably, but so are the anti-examples.

Wait another idea: The specific theme might be that they are all rivers that are primary rivers in their respective countries but are not among the most famous ones. But that's vague. Alternatively, maybe the rivers that are entirely within a single country? Let me check:

- Rhone flows through France and Switzerland. So跨国.
- Arno is entirely in Italy.
- Ebro is entirely in Spain.
Hmm, so two are within a single country, one跨国. Not a clear pattern.

Alternatively, maybe they are all rivers that have major wine regions? Rhone has the Rhone Valley wine region. Arno? Florence is near Chianti. Ebro has Rioja? Maybe. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, they might all have large dams or something.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the examples are all rivers that flow into the Mediterranean Sea. Let me confirm:

- Rhone: Flows into the Mediterranean (yes).
- Arno: Flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea (part of the Mediterranean basin but not directly into the Mediterranean proper? The Tyrrhenian is a marginal sea of the Mediterranean, so maybe considered part of it. Alternatively, the user might consider that the Arno doesn't flow into the Mediterranean directly but the others do. Wait, the Ebro flows into the Mediterranean in Spain. The Arno flows into the Tyrrhenian, which is part of the Mediterranean. The Rhone into the Mediterranean. So maybe all three are Mediterranean rivers. The anti-examples:

- Tiber flows into the Tyrrhenian (so also Mediterranean basin), so that would not fit if the theme is strictly Mediterranean. But the anti-examples include Tiber, which is part of the same basin, so maybe that's not it.

Hmm, maybe the theme is that they are all major rivers that are not part of the Danube, Rhine, or other major ones. Not helpful.

Wait another angle: The names. Rhone, Arno, Ebro – all have names that end with a vowel (e, o, o). The anti-examples: Tiber (ends with 'r'), Garonne (ends with 'e'), Danube (ends with 'e'). Wait, Garonne ends with 'e' but is an anti-example. So maybe not just ending with a vowel. Alternatively, maybe the names are of Celtic origin? Rhone might be Celtic, Arno perhaps, Ebro as well. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first letter is a vowel? Arno starts with 'A', Ebro with 'E', but Rhone starts with 'R'. No.

Alternatively, maybe they are all rivers that are in countries that are peninsulas? Rhone in France (part of the European mainland but France has a lot of coastlines), Arno in Italy (a peninsula), Ebro in Spain (Iberian peninsula). So two peninsulas, one not. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: The examples are all major rivers in their countries but not the largest? For example, in Spain, the Ebro is a major river but not the largest (maybe the Tagus or Duero). In Italy, the Po is larger than the Arno. In France, the Rhone is major but the Loire or Seine are also big. Not sure if that's the theme.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that flow through a specific type of landscape? Like mountainous regions? Rhone starts in the Alps, Arno in the Apennines, Ebro in the Iberian mountains. Maybe the anti-examples are different? Tiber also starts in the Apennines, so that might not be it.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the examples are all rivers that are entirely within a single country, except the Rhone which goes through France and Switzerland. Hmm, but Ebro and Arno are entirely within Spain and Italy. The anti-examples: Danube flows through multiple countries, Garonne through France and Spain? No, Garonne is in France. Tiber entirely in Italy. So maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all major rivers that are not part of any of the major river systems like the Rhine, Danube, etc. But the examples include Rhone, which is a major river.

Hmm, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that have their sources in mountain ranges but do not flow into the Atlantic Ocean. Let me check:

- Rhone flows into the Mediterranean (correct).
- Arno into the Tyrrhenian (part of Mediterranean).
- Ebro into the Mediterranean.
Anti-examples:

- Tiber also into Tyrrhenian (so part of the same basin).
- Garonne into the Atlantic.
- Danube into the Black Sea (not Mediterranean). 

Ah! Wait, the anti-examples include Tiber (same basin as examples), but also Garonne (Atlantic) and Danube (Black Sea). The key might be that the examples all flow into the Mediterranean Sea (or its marginal seas like the Tyrrhenian), while the anti-examples include rivers that flow into other seas. But Tiber is in the same basin as the examples, so that complicates it. Alternatively, perhaps the examples are rivers that flow into the Mediterranean, while the anti-examples include ones that flow into the Black Sea or Atlantic. But Tiber is in the same basin as the examples, so why is it an anti-example? That suggests the theme isn't strictly about the sea they flow into. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that are in countries that have a coastline on the Mediterranean. Rhone (France), Arno (Italy), Ebro (Spain). All these countries have Mediterranean coasts. The anti-examples: Tiber (Italy, which does have a coast), Garonne (France, also has Mediterranean coast), Danube (flows into Black Sea, but the countries along it have Black Sea access). So that might not fit.

Wait, maybe the theme is that the rivers are entirely within the Mediterranean region. But that's similar. Alternatively, the theme could be that they are all secondary rivers in their countries, not the most famous ones. For example, in Italy, the Po is more prominent than the Arno. In Spain, Ebro is a major river but maybe not the most famous (like the Tagus). In France, Rhone is major but the Seine is more iconic. But anti-examples include Danube (very famous), Tiber (Rome's river), Garonne (famous for wine regions like Bordeaux). Not sure.

Wait another angle: The names. Rhone, Arno, Ebro – maybe they are all ancient names from pre-Roman languages? Like Celtic or Iberian? For example, "Ebro" is from Iberian, "Arno" from Etruscan, "Rhone" from Celtic. If that's the case, the anti-examples like Tiber (Latin/Roman name), Garonne (maybe Celtic but perhaps the user considers it as a Latin-based name?), Danube (Latin "Danuvius"). Hmm, but I'm not sure. This requires more knowledge.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that have a delta. Let me see:

- Rhone has a delta in the Camargue.
- Arno has a delta near Pisa.
- Ebro has a large delta in Spain.
Anti-examples:

- Tiber has a delta near Rome, but maybe smaller? Not sure.
- Garonne has a delta as well.
- Danube has a massive delta in Romania. 

So that might not be it.

Wait, maybe the key is that the examples are all rivers that are in countries that are part of the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and France. The anti-examples include the Danube (Central Europe), Garonne (France, but maybe it's a stretch?), Tiber (Italy). Hmm, but that doesn't explain why Garonne is an anti-example if it's in France like Rhone. So that might not be the case.

Alternatively, the theme could be that they are all rivers that are part of the same drainage basin as the Mediterranean, but the anti-examples include Tiber (which is in the same basin). So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me list the examples and anti-examples again:

Examples: Rhone, Arno, Ebro.

Anti-examples: Tiber, Garonne, Danube.

Looking at the names again, maybe they are all rivers that are mentioned in ancient literature or have mythological significance? For example, the Tiber is associated with Rome's founding, Danube with Roman frontiers. Maybe the examples are less mythologically associated? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all rivers that have a major wine region associated with them. Rhone Valley wines, Douro (wait, Douro is a candidate, but let's see), Arno might not be as associated. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another thought: The examples might all be rivers that have their names starting with a vowel or consonant? Rhone (starts with 'R'), Arno ('A'), Ebro ('E'). The anti-examples: Tiber (T), Garonne (G), Danube (D). So the examples have names starting with vowels (A, E) and R. Not a clear pattern except maybe the first letters are A, E, R, which could spell something? Not sure.

Alternatively, the theme could be that the rivers are all in countries that are in the southern part of Europe: Rhone in France (southern), Arno in Italy (central), Ebro in Spain (southern). The anti-examples: Tiber in central Italy (so still southern Europe), Garonne in France (southwest), Danube in Central/Eastern Europe. So maybe the anti-examples include those in Eastern Europe (Danube) or Northern (Garonne in France's southwest is still southern). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the examples are all rivers that are in the countries that have a coastline on the Mediterranean but the rivers themselves do not flow into the Atlantic. For instance:

- Rhone flows into Mediterranean, so yes.
- Arno into Tyrrhenian (part of Med).
- Ebro into Med.
Anti-examples:

- Tiber into Tyrrhenian (Med), so same as examples. So that can't be.
- Garonne flows into Atlantic (so different).
- Danube into Black Sea (different).

Hmm, but Tiber is an anti-example but is in the same basin. So the theme might be that they are all rivers in the Mediterranean basin except those that flow into the Black Sea or Atlantic. But Tiber is in the same basin as the examples, so that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the theme is that they are all rivers that are in countries that are part of the European Union's Mediterranean member states (France, Italy, Spain) but not the anti-examples which include Danube (which flows through non-EU countries like Serbia, but also EU countries like Germany, Austria, etc.), Tiber is in Italy (EU), Garonne in France (EU). So that's not it.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to think of another angle. Let me look up the rivers' characteristics quickly in my mind:

- Rhone: Flows through France and Switzerland, major river, Mediterranean.
- Arno: Italy, flows through Florence, Tyrrhenian.
- Ebro: Spain, flows into Mediterranean.
Anti-examples:

- Tiber: Italy, flows through Rome, Tyrrhenian.
- Garonne: France, flows into Atlantic.
- Danube: Flows through multiple countries, ends in Black Sea.

Wait, maybe the key is that the examples are all rivers that are entirely within a single country except for the Rhone (Switzerland and France), but Ebro and Arno are entirely within Spain and Italy. The anti-examples include Danube (multiple countries), Garonne (France and Spain?), but Garonne is entirely in France except for a very short part in Spain? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the examples are all in the Iberian peninsula, Italy, and France, which are all in the southern Europe, while the anti-examples include rivers from other regions. But Tiber is in Italy, so that's not it.

Wait a minute, maybe the theme is that the examples are all rivers that have their names ending with a vowel? Let's check:

- Rhone ends with 'e' (if spelled with an 'e' at the end? In English it's spelled Rhone without, but in French it's Rhône, ending with 'e' in some pronunciations. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the original names in their languages:

Rhone (French: Rhône) ends with 'e' (Rhône is spelled with an 'e'), Arno (Italian) ends with 'o', Ebro (Spanish) ends with 'o'. So the endings are -e, -o, -o. The anti-examples:

- Tiber (ends with 'r'), Garonne (ends with 'e'), Danube (ends with 'e'). So Garonne and Danube end with 'e', which would fit the ending pattern. But they are anti-examples, so that can't be the theme.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the first two letters are vowels? Arno (A), Ebro (E), Rhone (R). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that are in countries that have a national language with Romance roots (France, Italy, Spain), which the anti-examples also include (Tiber in Italy, Garonne in France, Danube in countries like Germany, Austria, which are Germanic). So maybe the Danube is excluded because it's in non-Romance areas, but Tiber and Garonne are in Romance countries. Hmm, but the anti-examples include Tiber and Garonne which are in Romance countries, so that's conflicting.

Wait another idea: The examples are all rivers that have a major city as their endpoint. Rhone ends near Arles (maybe not), Arno ends near Pisa, Ebro into the Mediterranean near Tarragona? Not sure. Alternatively, they flow through major cities: Rhone through Lyon, Arno through Florence, Ebro through Zaragoza. The anti-examples: Tiber through Rome, Garonne through Bordeaux, Danube through Vienna and Budapest. So that's not the distinguishing factor.

Hmm, this is tough. Maybe I should consider that the examples are all rivers that are in countries that were part of the Roman Empire's core provinces, but that might not help.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that have a certain type of mouth, like a delta or estuary. But the anti-examples also have those.

Wait, perhaps the key is the length. Let me recall approximate lengths:

- Rhone: ~813 miles (1,308 km)
- Arno: ~154 miles (248 km)
- Ebro: ~510 miles (820 km)

Anti-examples:

- Tiber: ~246 miles (395 km)
- Garonne: ~357 miles (575 km)
- Danube: ~1,777 miles (2,857 km)

Hmm, maybe the examples are all medium-length rivers, not the very long ones. Danube is the longest, so that's excluded. But Garonne is mid-length. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all rivers that are not among the top 10 longest in Europe. Danube is top, Rhone is in top 10? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that are in countries where the name of the river is also the name of a region or wine area. Like Rhone Valley, Douro (which is a candidate, but let's see), Arno might not have that. Ebro has a region. Maybe that's it. So the examples are rivers that have a wine region named after them. The anti-examples: Tiber (no major wine region?), Garonne (Bordeaux is in Garonne valley?), Danube (Wachau wine region but maybe not the river's name). Hmm, possible. Let me think:

- Rhone Valley is a famous wine region.
- Douro River in Portugal (but Douro is a candidate, not an example here). 
- Arno? Not sure, but maybe less known.
- Ebro has the Ebro Valley, but not as famous as Rhone. 

If that's the case, then the theme would be rivers associated with notable wine regions. Then the anti-examples like Tiber (no), Garonne (Bordeaux is on Garonne, so maybe it should be an example?), but Garonne is an anti-example. Hmm, conflicting. So maybe not.

Alternatively, the theme is that they are all rivers that are entirely within a single country except for the Rhone (which is in France and Switzerland), but the anti-examples include Danube (multiple countries), Tiber (single), Garonne (single). Not helpful.

Wait another angle: The examples might be all rivers that are in countries where the name of the river is also a male first name. Like Rhone (not a name), Arno (a name), Ebro (maybe in Spanish?), not sure. Not likely.

Alternatively, the theme is that they are all rivers that have a major bridge named after them. Not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the anti-examples: Tiber, Garonne, Danube. What do they have in common that the examples don't?

- Tiber: Flows through Rome, a major city.
- Garonne: Flows through Bordeaux, major city, and is a major river in France.
- Danube: One of the most famous rivers in Europe, flows through many countries.

The examples are maybe less globally famous rivers? Rhone is well-known, Arno (Florence), Ebro. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the theme is that the examples are all rivers that are in countries that are on the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and France (so Western Europe), while the anti-examples include the Danube (Central/Eastern Europe) and Garonne is in France but maybe it's not part of the specific region within France. Not sure.

Alternatively, the theme could be that the examples are all rivers that have their names starting with a letter that's a vowel or a consonant, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: The examples are all rivers that are in countries that have a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea, and the rivers themselves flow into the Mediterranean or its marginal seas. The anti-examples include Tiber (same), Garonne (flows into Atlantic), Danube (Black Sea). But since Tiber is an anti-example even though it's in the same basin, maybe the theme is something else.

Alternatively, the theme is that they are all rivers that have a certain type of mouth, like a delta or a straight mouth. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all rivers that are not part of a larger river system. For example, the Danube is part of a larger system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is that they are all rivers that are in countries where the river's name is also the name of a region or a wine area. As before, but Garonne is part of the Bordeaux region, so that might not fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. The user says that the anti-examples can follow broader or related themes but not the exact one. So maybe the exact theme is a subset of a broader theme that the anti-examples fit.

Suppose the broader theme is "European rivers," and the specific theme is a subset. The examples are Rhone, Arno, Ebro. The anti-examples are Tiber, Garonne, Danube. What's the subset?

Maybe the subset is "rivers that flow into the Mediterranean Sea" (so including Tyrrhenian, etc.), which would exclude Danube (Black Sea) and Garonne (Atlantic), but include Tiber (Tyrrhenian). Since Tiber is an anti-example, that can't be. So maybe "rivers in countries that are on the Iberian Peninsula or Italy or southern France." But that's too vague.

Alternatively, maybe the specific theme is "rivers that are in countries that have a name starting with the same letter as the river." Rhone-France (no), Arno-Italy (A vs I), Ebro-Spain (E vs S). No.

Alternatively, the rivers are all in countries that have a capital city whose name starts with the same letter as the river. Rhone-France (Paris starts with P), no. Not helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the examples are all rivers that have their names ending with a vowel in their native language. For example:

- Rhône (French) ends with 'e'.
- Arno (Italian) ends with 'o'.
- Ebro (Spanish) ends with 'o'.

The anti-examples:

- Tiber (Italian) ends with 'e' (Tevere in Italian), so that would fit.
- Garonne (French) ends with 'e'.
- Danube (German: Donau, ends with 'e' in some languages). 

This doesn't work because some anti-examples also fit.

Another angle: The examples might be rivers that are not part of the major transnational rivers. The Rhone flows through France and Switzerland, which is two countries, but the anti-example Danube flows through many more. But Tiber and Garonne are in single countries. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that have a certain type of fish, like salmon? Not sure.

Alternatively, the rivers are all in countries that have a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea but the river itself does not flow into the Atlantic. Since the examples all flow into the Mediterranean or its marginal seas, while anti-examples include Garonne (Atlantic) and Danube (Black Sea). But Tiber flows into the Tyrrhenian (Mediterranean), yet it's an anti-example. So that can't be the exact theme.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I need to consider that the examples are all rivers that are in countries where the name of the river is also the name of a wine region. Rhone (Rhone Valley), Douro (a candidate, but not an example), Ebro (Ebro Valley?), Arno (no). Maybe that's part of it, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that are part of the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, or France, and have a certain length. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the examples are all rivers that are in countries that are in the Southern Europe, excluding the Balkans, while the Danube is in the Balkans. Tiber and Garonne are in Southern Europe, so that still doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the theme could be that they are all rivers that have a major hydroelectric dam. Rhone has several dams, Arno has Florence's dam, Ebro has dams. Not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the candidates and see if I can infer the theme from their scores.

Looking at the candidates:

1. Seine (France, flows into English Channel)
2. Douro (Portugal, flows into Atlantic)
3. Thames (England, flows into North Sea)
4. Po (Italy, flows into Adriatic Sea)
5. Guadalquivir (Spain, flows into Atlantic)
6. Marne (France, flows into Seine, then English Channel)
7. Rhine (Germany/Switzerland, flows into North Sea)
8. Loire (France, flows into Atlantic)

If the theme is flowing into the Mediterranean or its marginal seas (like Adriatic, Tyrrhenian), then:

Examples (Rhone, Arno, Ebro) all flow into the Mediterranean or its marginal seas (Tyrrhenian for Arno, Mediterranean for Ebro and Rhone).

Anti-examples: Tiber (Tyrrhenian, so same basin) is an anti-example, which contradicts. So that can't be the theme.

Alternatively, if the theme is flowing into the Mediterranean Sea proper (not marginal seas), then:

- Rhone flows directly into Mediterranean.
- Arno into Tyrrhenian (marginal), so not.
- Ebro into Mediterranean.

Thus, only Rhone and Ebro would fit, but Arno doesn't. So that's not it.

Hmm. Another thought: The examples might all be rivers that are in countries that have a coastline on the Mediterranean but the rivers themselves do not flow into the Atlantic. The anti-examples include Garonne (flows into Atlantic), Danube (Black Sea), Tiber (Tyrrhenian). So Tiber is in the same basin as the examples but is an anti-example, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all rivers that are in countries that have a name starting with the same letter as the river. Rhone-France (no), Arno-Italy (A vs I), Ebro-Spain (E vs S). Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the theme is that they are all rivers that have a major city as their source. Not sure.

Alternatively, the theme could be that the rivers are all in countries that are part of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain/Portugal), Italy, or France, and have a certain length. The anti-examples include Tiber (Italy), which is in the same region, so that's conflicting.

This is really challenging. Maybe I should consider that the examples are all rivers that have their names starting with a vowel or a consonant. Let's see:

Examples start with R, A, E (so vowels A and E, and R). Anti-examples start with T, G, D. Not a pattern.

Alternatively, the theme is that the rivers are all in countries where the name of the river is also the name of a famous historical figure or place. Not sure.

Wait, another angle: The examples might all be rivers that are in countries that are in the European Union's Mediterranean members (France, Italy, Spain) but the anti-examples include Tiber (Italy) so that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps the key is that the examples are all rivers that are in countries that are on the Iberian Peninsula or Italy, but the Rhone is in France. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rivers are all in countries where the river's name is also the name of a famous wine region. For instance:

- Rhone Valley (wine region)
- Douro (a candidate, but not an example here)
- Ebro Valley might have wine, but not as famous.
- Arno? Not sure.

If that's the case, then the anti-examples like Garonne (Bordeaux wine region) would be an example, but it's an anti-example. So that's conflicting.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to make an educated guess. Let's consider that the theme is that the examples are all rivers that flow into the Mediterranean Sea (including marginal seas like the Adriatic, Tyrrhenian, etc.), while the anti-examples are those that flow into other seas. But Tiber flows into the Tyrrhenian, which is part of the Mediterranean, so why is it an anti-example? That suggests the theme is something else.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that have a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea but do not flow into the Atlantic. The anti-examples include Garonne (flows into Atlantic) and Danube (Black Sea). Tiber flows into the Tyrrhenian (Mediterranean), so it should be an example but it's an anti-example. Therefore, that can't be.

Wait, maybe the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that are part of the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, or southern France, and their names end with a vowel. The examples:

- Rhone (ends with 'e' in French)
- Arno ('o')
- Ebro ('o')

Anti-examples:

- Tiber (ends with 'r')
- Garonne (ends with 'e')
- Danube (ends with 'e')

So Garonne and Danube end with vowels but are anti-examples. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rivers are in countries that are part of the Iberian Peninsula or Italy, but the Rhone is in France. Not quite.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that have a national language that uses the letter 'ñ' or 'ç'? No.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the examples are all rivers that are in countries that have a certain type of government historically, but that's too vague.

Wait, perhaps the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that are on the southern side of the Alps, while the anti-examples are not. The Rhone is in southern France, Arno in Italy south of the Alps, Ebro in Spain. The anti-examples: Tiber in Italy, so still south of Alps. Garonne in southern France. Danube flows through Austria, which is north of the Alps. So maybe Danube is excluded because it's north of the Alps. But Tiber and Garonne are in the south, so they should be examples but are anti-examples. Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that are part of the European Union's Mediterranean members (France, Italy, Spain), but the anti-examples include Tiber (Italy) so that's not it.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think of the anti-examples and see what they have in common that the examples don't.

Anti-examples: Tiber, Garonne, Danube.

What's common among them?

- Tiber flows through Rome, a major city.
- Garonne flows through Bordeaux, a major city.
- Danube flows through multiple capitals.

Examples: Rhone flows through Lyon (major), Arno through Florence, Ebro through Zaragoza (less major?).

Maybe the theme is that the examples are rivers that are not the most prominent or central to their countries. For example, in Italy, the Po is more central than the Arno. In France, the Seine (a candidate) is more central than the Rhone. In Spain, the Ebro is major but not the most central. The anti-examples are rivers that are central to their countries (Tiber in Rome, Garonne in Bordeaux, Danube in multiple countries).

If that's the case, then the theme is "rivers that are major but not the most central or iconic rivers in their countries". Then evaluating the candidates:

1. Seine (France's most iconic, so anti-example)
2. Douro (Portugal's major wine region, maybe fits)
3. Thames (London's river, very central, so anti)
4. Po (Italy's longest, very central, so anti)
5. Guadalquivir (Spain's, flows through Cordoba, maybe fits)
6. Marne (less central than Seine, so fits)
7. Rhine (very central in Europe, anti)
8. Loire (major but not as central as Seine, maybe fits)

So scores would be lower for the most central ones. Let's see:

- Seine (1) is very central → 0 or 1
- Douro (2) is major but not central → maybe 8?
- Thames (3) central → 0
- Po (4) very central → 0
- Guadalquivir (5) less central → maybe 7
- Marne (6) less → 5?
- Rhine (7) very central → 0
- Loire (8) somewhat central but maybe fits → 6?

But I'm not sure if this is the correct theme. Alternatively, the theme could be "rivers that flow into the Mediterranean or its marginal seas, excluding those that flow through capitals". But Tiber flows through Rome, so it would be excluded, fitting as an anti-example. Garonne doesn't flow through Paris, it flows through Bordeaux. Danube through Vienna and Budapest.

So if the theme is "rivers that flow into the Mediterranean or its marginal seas and do not flow through a capital city", then:

Examples:

- Rhone flows through Lyon (not the capital), so yes.
- Arno through Florence (not Rome), yes.
- Ebro through Zaragoza (not Madrid), yes.

Anti-examples:

- Tiber through Rome → excluded.
- Garonne through Bordeaux (not Paris's main river, but Paris is on Seine → maybe it's okay?), but Garonne flows into Atlantic so also excluded.
- Danube through capitals → excluded.

But Garonne flows into the Atlantic, so it's excluded for that reason too.

If that's the theme, then candidates:

1. Seine → flows into English Channel (not Med), and through Paris → 0
2. Douro → flows into Atlantic, so 0
3. Thames → North Sea and through London → 0
4. Po → flows into Adriatic (part of Med), and through Turin? The Po flows through Turin, but Turin is not the capital (Rome). So Po would fit. But anti-example is Tiber (Rome). Wait, Po is in Italy and flows into Adriatic (Med basin), and doesn't flow through the capital. So Po would be an example, but it's a candidate. Hmm, conflicting.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should pick the first idea where the theme is flowing into the Mediterranean or its marginal seas, and the anti-examples include those that flow into other seas. Even though Tiber is in the same basin, perhaps the user considers the anti-examples to have other reasons. Maybe the theme is that the examples are rivers that are in countries that are on the Iberian Peninsula or Italy, and the anti-examples include France (Garonne) and Danube (Central Europe). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the examples are all rivers that are in countries where the name of the river is also the name of a famous wine region. Rhone (Rhone Valley), Douro (a candidate, but not an example), Ebro (Ebro Valley?), Arno (no). So maybe that's the case. Then:

Candidates:

1. Seine → no wine region → 0
2. Douro → yes → 10
3. Thames → no → 0
4. Po → no → 0
5. Guadalquivir → maybe? Not as famous → 5
6. Marne → Champagne region (Marne wine), so maybe 7?
7. Rhine → Rhine wine region → 8 but it's an anti-example? Wait, Rhine is a candidate. Wait, the anti-examples include Danube, Tiber, Garonne. So if Rhine is a candidate, and if the theme is wine regions, then Rhine would score high. But the examples include Rhone, so maybe Rhine is an example? But the user's candidates include Rhine as a candidate, not an example. Hmm, confusing.

Alternatively, the theme is that the rivers are in countries that are part of the Iberian Peninsula or Italy, and flow into the Mediterranean. Then:

Examples fit:

- Rhone (France, but flows into Med)
- Arno (Italy)
- Ebro (Spain)

Anti-examples:

- Tiber (Italy) → same, so why anti-example? Hmm.

This is really challenging. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the flow direction. Even though Tiber is in the same basin, perhaps the user considers that the examples are rivers that flow into the Mediterranean Sea proper (not marginal seas like Tyrrhenian), so:

- Rhone into Med, Ebro into Med → yes.
- Arno into Tyrrhenian → no.

That doesn't fit. Alternatively, the theme is that the rivers are in countries that are on the Iberian Peninsula or Italy, and the anti-examples are in France or other regions. But the Rhone is in France. 

Wait, perhaps the theme is that the rivers are all in countries where the name of the river is also the name of a province or region. For example:

- Rhone region in France.
- Arno might not, but Tuscany is near Arno.
- Ebro region in Spain.

Anti-examples: Tiber (no province named Tiber?), Garonne (Garonne region?), Danube (Bavaria?).

This could be possible. Then the candidates:

1. Seine → no → 0
2. Douro → Douro region → 10
3. Thames → no → 0
4. Po → Po Valley → 10
5. Guadalquivir → Andalusia? Not sure → 5
6. Marne → Marne department → 8
7. Rhine → Rhine region → 10 but it's a candidate, not an example. Wait, the examples include Rhone, so maybe Rhine is similar but not part of the specific theme. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that are in the Iberian Peninsula or Italy, but Rhone is in France. Not sure.

I think I'm going to have to proceed with the assumption that the theme is flowing into the Mediterranean Sea or its marginal seas, and the anti-examples include those that flow into other seas. Even though Tiber is in the same basin, maybe it's an exception for another reason. 

Given that, the candidates:

1. Seine → flows into English Channel → 0
2. Douro → flows into Atlantic → 0
3. Thames → North Sea → 0
4. Po → flows into Adriatic (part of Med) → 10
5. Guadalquivir → flows into Atlantic → 0
6. Marne → English Channel → 0
7. Rhine → flows into North Sea → 0
8. Loire → Atlantic → 0

But this can't be right because the examples include Ebro (flows into Med), Arno (Tyrrhenian), Rhone (Med). But the anti-examples include Tiber (Tyrrhenian), so that contradicts. 

Alternatively, the theme is that the rivers are in countries that are part of the Iberian Peninsula or Italy, and the anti-examples are in other regions:

Examples:

- Rhone (France) → not Iberian or Italy, so this breaks the theme.

Hmm. I'm clearly missing something. Let's try to think of another angle. The examples are Rhone, Arno, Ebro. The anti-examples are Tiber, Garonne, Danube. Maybe the key is that the examples are all rivers that are in countries that have a national language with a Romance root, and the rivers' names end with a vowel in that language. 

- Rhone: French "Rhône" ends with 'e'.
- Arno: Italian ends with 'o'.
- Ebro: Spanish ends with 'o'.

Anti-examples:

- Tiber: Italian "Tevere" ends with 'e', so should be included but is anti-example. 
- Garonne: French ends with 'e', so included but is anti-example.
- Danube: German "Donau" ends with 'e', included but anti-example.

This doesn't work because the anti-examples also fit.

Another thought: The examples are all rivers that have a certain type of flow direction, like from north to south. Rhone flows south, Arno west, Ebro east. Not a pattern.

Wait, maybe the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that are in the southern part of Europe and have a name starting with a vowel or consonant that is a vowel in the local language. Not sure.

Alternatively, the theme could be that the rivers are all in countries that have a coastline on the Mediterranean Sea and are not part of the Danube basin or other major basins. But the anti-example Danube is excluded because it's a major basin.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted my options. I'll proceed with the assumption that the theme is that the rivers flow into the Mediterranean Sea or its marginal seas, and the anti-examples are those flowing into other seas. Even though Tiber is in the same basin, perhaps the user considers it an exception for another reason, like it's the Tiber River in Rome, making it too prominent.

Thus, evaluating candidates:

1. Seine → English Channel → 0
2. Douro → Atlantic → 0
3. Thames → North Sea → 0
4. Po → Adriatic (Mediterranean) → 10
5. Guadalquivir → Atlantic → 0
6. Marne → English Channel → 0
7. Rhine → North Sea → 0
8. Loire → Atlantic → 0

But the examples include Ebro (Mediterranean), Arno (Tyrrhenian), Rhone (Mediterranean). So Po flows into Adriatic, which is part of the Mediterranean, so that should be a 10. But the anti-example Tiber flows into Tyrrhenian (Mediterranean) but is an anti-example. Maybe the theme is stricter, like flowing directly into the Mediterranean Sea proper, not marginal seas. Then:

- Arno flows into Tyrrhenian (marginal), so would be excluded. But it's an example. So that's not.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is flowing into the Mediterranean Sea proper, not any marginal seas. Then only Rhone and Ebro qualify, but Arno is an example, so that's not.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll proceed with the following tentative scores based on the assumption that the theme is flowing into the Mediterranean or its marginal seas, and the anti-examples are others:

1. Seine → 0
2. Douro → 0
3. Thames → 0
4. Po → 10
5. Guadalquivir → 0
6. Marne → 0
7. Rhine → 0
8. Loire → 0

But since the anti-example Tiber is in the same category, this must be wrong. 

Another angle: The examples are all rivers that have a major city as their source. Not sure.

Wait, the anti-examples include Danube, which is a major river. Maybe the theme is that the examples are all rivers that are not among the longest in Europe. Let's check lengths:

- Danube is longest, so excluded.
- Rhone is long but not the longest.
- Arno is shorter.
- Ebro is medium.

So candidates:

- Po is longer than Ebro, but not as long as Danube. Maybe Po is okay.
- Rhine is longer than Rhone, so excluded (anti-example? No, Rhine is a candidate here. Wait, the anti-examples are Tiber, Garonne, Danube. So Rhine is a candidate. If the theme is not being the longest, then Rhine might score lower.

This is too uncertain. I'll have to make educated guesses based on possible themes. Let's try another approach: The examples are all rivers that are in countries that have a name starting with the same letter as the river's first letter. 

Examples:

- Rhone (R) → France (F) → no
- Arno (A) → Italy (I) → no
- Ebro (E) → Spain (S) → no

No pattern.

Alternatively, the rivers' names have a certain number of letters:

- Rhone (5 letters?), Arno (4), Ebro (4)
- Anti-examples: Tiber (5), Garonne (7), Danube (6)

No pattern.

Hmm. I think I need to conclude with the best guess I have, even if it's not perfect. Let's try to assume the theme is flowing into the Mediterranean Sea or its marginal seas, and the anti-examples are those that flow into other seas. Even with Tiber being an exception, I'll proceed:

Scores:

1. Seine → English Channel → 0
2. Douro → Atlantic → 0
3. Thames → North Sea → 0
4. Po → Adriatic → 10
5. Guadalquivir → Atlantic → 0
6. Marne → English Channel → 0
7. Rhine → North Sea → 0
8. Loire → Atlantic → 0

But the examples include Arno (Tyrrhenian), which is a marginal sea, so Po (Adriatic) fits. Tiber is Tyrrhenian but is an anti-example, so maybe the theme excludes Italy's rivers. But then Arno is in Italy. Contradiction.

Alternatively, the theme is that the rivers are in Spain or France, excluding Italy. Then:

Examples: Rhone (France), Ebro (Spain). Arno (Italy) would not fit, so that's not.

Hmm. Another idea: The examples are all rivers that have their names spelled with a 'B' or 'H' somewhere. Rhone has 'h', Arno none, Ebro has 'b'. Not a pattern.

Alternatively, the theme is that the rivers are all in countries that have a national language with a Romance root, and the rivers' names end with a vowel in that language. As before, but anti-examples include Tiber (ends with 'e' in Italian). So that can't be.

I think I'm going to have to proceed with the following, even if it's not perfect. Maybe the theme is that they are all major rivers in their countries but not the most famous ones, leading to lower scores for very famous rivers like Thames, Seine, Po, etc.

Scores:

1. Seine (very famous) → 0
2. Douro (less famous) → 8
3. Thames (very famous) → 0
4. Po (major but not as iconic as Danube) → 7
5. Guadalquivir (medium) → 5
6. Marne (less central) → 4
7. Rhine (major) → 0
8. Loire (major) → 3

This is a guess, but it spreads the scores across the range.
