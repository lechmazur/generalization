Okay, let's see. The user gave me examples and anti-examples to figure out a specific theme. The examples are satellite TV, Wi-Fi routers, and FM radio. The anti-examples are walkie-talkies, CB radios, and AM radio. Hmm, so I need to figure out what the common theme is between the examples that the anti-examples don't fit.

First, looking at the examples: satellite TV uses radio waves to send signals to a dish. Wi-Fi uses radio waves for local area networks. FM radio is a broadcast using a certain frequency range. The anti-examples include AM radio, which is similar to FM but on a different band. Walkie-talkies and CB radios are two-way communication, unlike the one-way broadcasts of FM or satellite TV.

Wait, maybe the theme is about one-way transmission over radio frequencies for broadcasting? But AM radio is also a broadcast, so that might not be it. Alternatively, maybe it's about specific frequency bands. FM is VHF/UHF, satellite TV uses microwave frequencies. Wi-Fi is 2.4 or 5 GHz. AM is lower frequency. But that might not be the key difference.

Another angle: the examples are all forms of broadcasting to many receivers, while the anti-examples are more point-to-point or two-way? Walkie-talkies and CB are two-way, so that's different. FM and satellite are one-way broadcast. AM radio is also broadcast, but it's listed as an anti-example. Hmm, so why is AM an anti-example? Maybe the theme is more about digital vs analog? But FM is analog, satellite and Wi-Fi can be digital. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the theme is about wireless transmission that's used for mass media distribution. So satellite TV, Wi-Fi (maybe as a general wireless tech?), and FM radio. The anti-examples like AM radio might be excluded because they're older or a different type. Walkie-talkies and CB are for direct communication, not broadcasting to the public. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is about specific technologies that use certain bands for broadcasting to multiple users simultaneously. Wi-Fi is a local network, but maybe it's considered a form of broadcast in the local area. Satellite and FM are definitely broadcasting. So the anti-examples are either two-way or use different bands or methods.

Now the candidates: 

1. Infrared remote controls: They use IR for short-range communication, like TV remotes. Not a broadcast medium for media, more point-to-point. Probably low score.

2. Coaxial cables: That's wired, so unlike the examples which are wireless. Probably 0.

3. Optical fiber networks: Also wired, so again, not wireless. Maybe 0 or low.

4. Telegraph systems: Old, uses Morse code over wires. Not wireless, so no.

5. Landline phones: Wired, so again, no.

6. Bluetooth headphones: Wireless, but point-to-point connection, not broadcasting. Maybe a 3 or 4.

7. Ethernet cables: Wired, so 0.

8. Fiber optic cables: Same as optical fiber, so 0.

Wait, but maybe the theme isn't strictly wireless. Let me think again. Wait the examples include satellite (wireless), Wi-Fi (wireless), FM (wireless). All wireless. The anti-examples are also wireless (walkie-talkie, CB, AM radio). But AM is an anti-example even though it's wireless. So maybe the theme is about a specific type of wireless transmission, like broadcast vs. two-way? So AM radio is a broadcast but still an anti-example. Hmm, maybe the difference is that the examples are digital? FM is analog, but satellite and Wi-Fi are digital. Not sure.

Alternatively, the examples are all using radio frequencies for broadcasting to multiple receivers, but AM is also a broadcast but maybe the theme excludes AM for some reason. Maybe the theme is about specific bands or services. For example, satellite TV uses microwave, Wi-Fi uses ISM bands, FM uses VHF. AM uses MF. Maybe the theme is higher frequency bands? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is about being a modern or current technology for mass media distribution. AM is older, so maybe that's why it's excluded. Then infrared remotes are not mass media. Coaxial is wired, so no. Bluetooth is personal area network, so not mass. Fiber is wired. Telegraph is old. Landline phones are point-to-point. So maybe the candidates would score low except maybe some? Wait, but the user wants a specific theme that the examples fit but anti-examples don't. Since the anti-examples include AM radio, which is a broadcast but still excluded, maybe the theme is about being a specific type of broadcast like audio/video over certain frequencies or methods. Alternatively, maybe the examples are all using radio waves for broadcasting to the public, while the anti-examples are either two-way (walkie-talkie, CB) or use a different modulation (AM vs FM). Not sure.

Alternatively, the examples are all unidirectional broadcast services that are part of the public media infrastructure, whereas AM radio, walkie-talkie, CB are more for personal or two-way communication. So the theme is one-way public broadcast services. Then infrared remotes are not public broadcast. Coaxial cables are infrastructure but wired. Optical fiber is also infrastructure but wired. So all candidates except maybe none would fit. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe I need to think of another angle.

Wait, maybe the theme is "wireless transmission that uses radio waves for broadcasting content to receivers that can be in a wide area". So satellite, FM radio, and Wi-Fi (which can cover a local area but still wireless). The anti-examples: walkie-talkie and CB are two-way, AM is a broadcast but perhaps considered a different category. Maybe the theme is about digital vs analog? FM is analog, satellite and Wi-Fi can be digital. Not sure. Alternatively, the examples are all using specific technologies for mass media (TV, internet, radio), while AM is a type of radio but maybe considered a different category. Maybe AM is excluded because it's a different frequency band, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is about transmission mediums that are not point-to-point. So satellite, FM, Wi-Fi are broadcast to many, while walkie-talkie and CB are two-way point-to-point. AM is broadcast but still excluded. Hmm, but why is AM excluded? Maybe because the theme is about a specific subset like digital broadcasting, but AM is analog. Alternatively, the theme could be "wireless transmission that uses a specific frequency band for broadcasting to multiple receivers, excluding AM radio and two-way communication devices". 

If that's the case, then the candidates:

1. Infrared remote: Not broadcast, point-to-point. Low score, like 1-2.

2. Coaxial cables: Wired, so 0.

3. Optical fiber: Wired, 0.

4. Telegraph: Wired and old, 0.

5. Landline: Wired, 0.

6. Bluetooth: Short-range, point-to-point, maybe 2-3.

7. Ethernet: Wired, 0.

8. Fiber optic: Same as 3, 0.

So maybe most are 0 except Bluetooth and infrared get low scores. Wait but the user said the anti-examples can follow a broader theme but not the exact. So the exact theme must be something that the examples have but the anti-examples don't. Let me try again.

Looking at examples and anti-examples:

Examples: satellite TV (one-way, high frequency), Wi-Fi (two-way but local broadcast), FM radio (one-way). Wait, Wi-Fi is two-way, but maybe the key is that they are for broadcasting content (like TV, internet, radio), whereas walkie-talkie and CB are for communication. AM is a broadcast but maybe it's considered a different type (audio only?), but not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "wireless transmission that is typically used for media broadcasting (audio/video) to the public", so AM is a broadcast but maybe the examples are more modern or higher bandwidth? So AM is excluded as an older tech. Then the candidates:

1. Infrared: Not media, so low.

2. Coaxial: Wired, 0.

3. Optical fiber: Wired, 0.

4. Telegraph: Not media, 0.

5. Landline: Not media broadcasting, 0.

6. Bluetooth: Maybe for audio (headphones), but point-to-point, so low.

7. Ethernet: Wired, 0.

8. Fiber optic: Same as 3, 0.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme is about using radio waves for broadcasting, excluding other forms. The anti-examples include AM which uses radio but maybe the examples are in specific bands. For instance, FM is VHF/UHF, satellite uses microwave, Wi-Fi uses 2.4/5 GHz. AM is MF. So maybe the theme is using higher frequency bands? Not sure.

Alternatively, the examples are all part of the electromagnetic spectrum for broadcasting, while the anti-examples are two-way or different. Then candidates like Bluetooth (radio waves, two-way) would get a low score. Infrared uses light, not radio, so even lower.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "wireless transmission that does not require a direct line of sight". Wait, satellite does (to the dish), but FM and Wi-Fi can have some line of sight but not always. Walkie-talkie sometimes needs line of sight, CB too. Not sure.

Hmm, this is challenging. Maybe the key is that the examples are all one-way broadcast services (satellite TV, FM radio) and Wi-Fi as a broadcast network (though it's two-way, maybe the infrastructure aspect). The anti-examples are two-way or different types. So the theme is one-way broadcast services. Then:

Infrared remotes are one-way but not a service, so low.

Coaxial is wired, so no.

Optical fiber is wired, no.

Telegraph is wired and two-way, no.

Landline is two-way, no.

Bluetooth is two-way, so no.

Ethernet is wired, no.

Fiber optic same as optical.

So all candidates would get 0 except maybe some? Wait, but maybe optical fiber can carry broadcast signals? But the question is about the specific theme, so unless the candidate is a service like the examples, they don't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "wireless transmission technologies used for public broadcasting of media content (audio/video)", excluding two-way and certain types. Then:

1. Infrared: No, not public media.

2. Coaxial: No.

3. Optical fiber: Can carry broadcast but is wired, so no.

4. Telegraph: No.

5. Landline: No.

6. Bluetooth: Not media broadcasting.

7. Ethernet: No.

8. Fiber optic: Same as 3.

So all would get 0 except maybe none. That can't be right because the user wants a range of scores. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the examples include Wi-Fi, which is a local network, not necessarily for public broadcast. Maybe the theme is about wireless transmission using radio waves for data transfer, but the anti-examples are two-way or lower frequency? Let me think of the anti-examples:

Walkie-talkie and CB are two-way, so maybe the theme is one-way. AM is one-way but still an anti-example. Hmm. Maybe AM is considered a different category like audio only, but FM and satellite include video. So the theme could be "wireless transmission of audio and video via radio waves for broadcasting", so AM is audio only, so excluded. Then:

Candidates:

1. Infrared: Not audio/video, so low.

2. Coaxial: Wired, 0.

3. Optical fiber: Can carry video/audio but wired.

4. Telegraph: No.

5. Landline: No.

6. Bluetooth: Transfers audio, but two-way and point-to-point, so maybe 3.

7. Ethernet: Wired.

8. Fiber optic: Same as 3.

So Bluetooth might get a 3. Infrared maybe 1.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "technologies that use radio waves for broadcasting to multiple receivers without a physical connection". Then:

Wi-Fi is wireless, but it's a local network (point-to-multipoint?), so maybe counts. FM and satellite are broadcast. The anti-examples: walkie-talkie is two-way, AM is broadcast but maybe considered a different category. So candidates:

Coaxial and optical are wired, so 0.

Bluetooth and infrared are wireless but not broadcasting to many. Maybe Bluetooth as a low score. Infrared even lower.

Telegraph and landline are wired, so 0.

Fiber optic same.

So maybe:

1. IR: 1

2. Coaxial: 0

3. Optical: 0

4. Telegraph:0

5. Landline:0

6. Bluetooth:2

7. Ethernet:0

8. Fiber optic:0

But the user wants a range up to 10, but I'm getting mostly 0s. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the theme. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the theme is "technologies that transmit data over the airwaves for public consumption", excluding two-way or specific types. Then:

Satellite, FM, Wi-Fi (as in internet access) are for public or mass consumption. AM is also public but excluded. Maybe the difference is that AM is considered a different type (analog audio), while the examples might include digital? Not sure.

Alternatively, the examples are all part of the electromagnetic spectrum used for broadcasting, but AM is a different part. Not sure.

Alternatively, the theme is "technologies that use radio waves for broadcasting content (audio/video) to the public", so AM is included but is listed as an anti-example. That contradicts. Hmm.

Wait, the user says the anti-examples can match a broader theme but not the specific one. So AM is part of a broader theme (radio broadcasts) but not the specific one. Maybe the specific theme is "digital wireless broadcasting", so FM is analog, satellite and Wi-Fi are digital. Then AM (analog) would be excluded. 

If that's the case, then:

1. Infrared: Not digital broadcasting, so low.

2. Coaxial: Wired.

3. Optical fiber: Can be digital, but wired.

4. Telegraph: Analog, wired.

5. Landline: Analog, two-way.

6. Bluetooth: Digital, but two-way.

7. Ethernet: Digital, wired.

8. Fiber optic: Same as 3.

So maybe Bluetooth could get a 3 because it's digital but two-way. Infrared maybe 1.

Alternatively, the theme is "wireless broadcasting of media (video/audio) over specific frequencies". So AM is audio only, maybe excluded for being audio only. Then FM and satellite include video. But Wi-Fi is data, so maybe it's included because it can carry media. Then:

Bluetooth can carry audio, so maybe gets a higher score? But it's two-way. Maybe a 4?

Hmm, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the best guesses based on the previous analysis.
