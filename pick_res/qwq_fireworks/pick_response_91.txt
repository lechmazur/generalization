Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples are Battleship Potemkin (1925), The Holy Virgin Mary (1996), and Frisk (1991). The anti-examples are The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), The Rite of Spring (1913), and Lolita (1955). 

Hmm, so the task is to identify what these examples have in common that the anti-examples don't, but the anti-examples are related but not exact. Let me think about each example.

Starting with Battleship Potemkin: that's a Soviet propaganda film about a real historical event, the 1905 rebellion on the Potemkin battleship. It's known for its revolutionary themes and cinematic techniques, like the Odessa Steps sequence. It's politically charged and uses art to make a strong statement.

Next, Chris Ofili's "The Holy Virgin Mary" is a controversial painting that features the Virgin Mary depicted with elephant dung and images that some found offensive, leading to backlash, especially from religious groups. It's about challenging traditional religious imagery and provoking reaction.

Dennis Cooper's "Frisk" is a novel known for its graphic, transgressive content, dealing with themes of violence, pedophilia, and a very dark, taboo-breaking narrative style. It's part of the transgressive literature movement.

Now the anti-examples. The Last Temptation of Christ caused controversy for its portrayal of Jesus, especially the idea of him doubting his divinity. It's religiously controversial but maybe more about challenging religious narratives rather than the specific theme here. Stravinsky's Rite of Spring was infamous for its premiere's riots due to its musical and choreographic innovations, but that's more about avant-garde shock in music and dance. Lolita is controversial for its subject matter involving an adult's relationship with a未成年少女, but it's more about moral ambiguity and literary style rather than the specific theme.

So, what's the common thread among the examples but not the anti-examples? Battleship Potemkin is political and revolutionary, Ofili's work is provocative against religious sensibilities, Frisk is transgressive and taboo-breaking. The anti-examples, while controversial, might not all be as focused on challenging specific societal or institutional norms in the same way. The Rite of Spring was about artistic innovation causing shock, which is different. Lolita's controversy is more about the subject matter's ethics rather than a direct provocation against an institution or pushing a transgressive aesthetic. The Last Temptation is similar to Ofili in religious provocation but maybe the examples are more about pushing boundaries in a way that's more aligned with transgressive art/literature with a rebellious edge against societal norms, maybe with a more intentional provocation.

So the theme might be works that intentionally provoke through transgressive or taboo-breaking content, often challenging specific institutions (like religion, societal norms) with a confrontational approach. The anti-examples, while controversial, might not be as intentionally provocative in the same way or their controversy stems from different aspects (like artistic style vs. content).

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. Hair (1967): A musical known for its anti-war and countercultural themes, addressing drug use, sexuality, and resistance to the draft. It's provocative in a 60s context, challenging societal norms. But is this as transgressive as the examples? Maybe, but perhaps not as explicitly taboo-breaking as Ofili or Frisk. Maybe a 6 or 7?

2. Ulysses by Joyce: Controversial for its content at the time, but more for stream-of-consciousness and sexual themes. It was banned for obscenity. However, compared to the examples, which are more overtly pushing boundaries against institutions (religion, societal norms), Ulysses' transgression is more literary and less directly confrontational. Maybe a 5 or 6?

3. Piss Christ by Serrano: This is a direct provocation against religious sensibilities, similar to Ofili's work. This should be a strong match, maybe 9 or 10. But wait, the anti-examples include The Last Temptation, which is also religious controversy. But the key difference might be that Piss Christ is more of a direct, in-your-face provocation using shock value, whereas The Last Temptation is a narrative work that's more about storytelling. Since Piss Christ is an anti-example? Wait no, the anti-examples are the ones that don't fit the specific theme. Wait, the anti-examples are the ones that are not part of the specific theme but could be part of a broader theme. Wait the user said the anti-examples are not examples of the specific theme but might follow a broader version. So Piss Christ is an example of the specific theme? Wait no, the user gave three examples (the first three) and three anti-examples (the next three). The task is to evaluate the candidates based on the specific theme from the examples, not the anti-examples. Wait, the user says the anti-examples do not match the specific theme. So the specific theme is found in the first three examples, and the anti-examples are not part of that. So Piss Christ (candidate 3) is similar to Ofili's work, which is an example. So maybe candidate 3 should be a high score, like 9 or 10. But wait, wait, the anti-examples include "The Last Temptation of Christ" which is religious controversy. So perhaps the specific theme is not just religious provocation, because then The Last Temptation would be an example. So maybe the theme is something else. Let me re-examine.

Wait the examples include Battleship Potemkin (revolutionary/political), Ofili's religious provocation, Frisk's transgressive content. The anti-examples include The Last Temptation (religious), Rite of Spring (avant-garde causing shock), Lolita (taboo subject but handled with literary merit). So the common theme among the examples might be works that are intentionally provocative and transgressive, often causing public outrage or controversy through explicit, taboo content, and challenging specific institutions (like religion, societal norms) with a confrontational approach. The anti-examples might be controversial but for different reasons: Rite of Spring is about artistic innovation causing shock, Lolita is a literary work that's ethically problematic but not as overtly transgressive in style, and The Last Temptation is similar to Ofili but maybe the specific theme requires a more direct provocation (like using offensive materials or explicit content) rather than narrative content.

So Piss Christ is a direct provocation using urine and religious imagery, similar to Ofili. So that's a 10? But the anti-examples don't include that, so it's an example. So candidate 3 would be a 10.

4. A Clockwork Orange: This film deals with ultra-violence, themes of free will vs. conditioning, and has explicit content. It was controversial for its violence and sexual content. It's transgressive and provocative. Kubrick even pulled it from release in the UK due to backlash. This seems to fit the theme. Maybe 8 or 9?

5. Sex Pistols' God Save the Queen: This is punk music, deliberately provocative, with anti-establishment lyrics, including the famous "God Save the Queen" which was banned and caused a lot of controversy. It's a direct attack on the British monarchy and establishment. This fits the theme of transgressive, confrontational art challenging institutions. Maybe 9?

6. The Exorcist: A horror film with intense content, but its controversy is more about shock value and horror elements rather than a direct challenge to an institution or societal norm in the same way. It's scary but not necessarily pushing a transgressive agenda against something specific. Maybe a 4 or 5?

7. Angels in America: A play dealing with AIDS crisis, homosexuality, and religious themes. It's provocative but more about addressing social issues and exploring identity. While controversial, it might not be as intentionally transgressive or shocking as the examples. Maybe a 6?

8. Duchamp's Fountain: Readymade art, a urinal presented as art. This was a radical challenge to the definition of art, causing controversy in the art world. It's a foundational example of conceptual art, pushing boundaries of what art can be. This fits the theme of provocative transgression against artistic norms. Maybe 9 or 10?

Wait, but the anti-examples include The Rite of Spring, which was avant-garde causing shock but not exactly the same as Fountain. The theme might be more about direct, in-your-face transgression against specific societal or institutional norms. So Fountain challenges the art world's norms, which is part of the theme. So 8 could be a 9 or 10.

Wait, let's recheck the examples. Battleship Potemkin is political revolution, Ofili's work is religious provocation, Frisk is literary transgression. So the theme is works that are provocative and transgressive in a way that directly challenges specific societal institutions (religion, government, art norms, etc.) with explicit content or form. So Fountain challenges art norms, which fits. Sex Pistols challenge monarchy and establishment. A Clockwork Orange challenges societal norms about violence and free will. Angels in America challenges societal views on AIDS and homosexuality, but maybe less confrontationally than the examples? Maybe.

Now, assigning scores:

1. Hair: Anti-war/counterculture, but maybe less extreme than the examples. Maybe a 6.

2. Ulysses: Banned for obscenity, but more literary. Maybe 5.

3. Piss Christ: Direct religious provocation, 10.

4. A Clockwork Orange: 8 or 9? Let's say 9.

5. God Save the Queen: 9.

6. Exorcist: 4.

7. Angels in America: 6 or 7. Maybe 6.

8. Fountain: 9 or 10. Since it's a foundational provocation in art, maybe 10?

Wait, but the user said the anti-examples include The Rite of Spring, which is avant-garde shock. Fountain is similar in challenging norms but maybe the specific theme requires the provocation to be more about content than form? Or maybe the theme is any transgressive provocation. Since the examples include a film (content), a painting (content), and a novel (content), maybe Fountain's form challenge fits. So 10.

Wait but I need to ensure that the anti-examples don't fit. Since the anti-examples include Rite of Spring, which is also about avant-garde form causing shock, but it's an anti-example, so the specific theme must exclude that. So perhaps the theme is more about content-based provocation rather than form-based. So Fountain's challenge is form, so maybe that's why Rite of Spring is an anti-example. Therefore, Fountain might not be a perfect fit. Hmm, this complicates things.

Wait, the examples include Battleship Potemkin which is a film about a political event (content), Ofili's content is the image (content), and Frisk's content is the narrative (content). The anti-examples: Rite of Spring is about musical and choreographic form causing shock, so form rather than content. Therefore, the specific theme might be content-based provocation against institutions or societal norms, not form-based. Therefore, Fountain's provocation is form-based (what is considered art), so it might be excluded. Therefore, Fountain would be an anti-example like Rite of Spring. Wait, but the user's anti-examples don't include Fountain. The user's anti-examples are The Last Temptation, Rite of Spring, Lolita. So maybe the theme includes both content and form, but the anti-examples are either form-based (Rite of Spring) or content that's more ethically ambiguous (Lolita) or religious narrative (Last Temptation). So perhaps the key is that the examples are more intentionally provocative with a confrontational edge, while the anti-examples have controversy but not as directly confrontational.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "works that have caused significant public controversy due to their provocative content, often involving taboo subjects or direct challenges to societal norms, institutions, or traditional values, with an intent to shock or provoke discourse." The anti-examples might have caused controversy but for different reasons. For example, Rite of Spring was controversial for its artistic innovation shocking the audience, not for its content. Lolita's controversy is more about the moral implications of its subject matter but presented in a literary way that's not as graphically confrontational. The Last Temptation's controversy is about religious content but maybe not as directly confrontational as Ofili's work which uses offensive materials.

Therefore, Fountain's controversy is about challenging the definition of art (a form/content issue), so it's similar to Rite of Spring in being form-based, hence an anti-example's category. So Fountain might not be a perfect fit, so maybe a lower score. Let's reassess.

Fountain by Duchamp: Challenges the concept of art, which is a form/content issue. Since the examples are content-based challenges (political, religious, literary taboos), Fountain might not fit as well. So maybe 7?

Sex Pistols' God Save the Queen: Lyrics attacking the monarchy, very direct. So 9.

A Clockwork Orange: Graphic violence and ultraviolence, challenging societal norms on violence and free will. 9.

Piss Christ: Direct religious provocation, 10.

Hair: Challenging societal norms (anti-war, sexual freedom), but maybe not as extreme as the examples. 7?

Ulysses: Banned for obscenity, but literary transgression. Maybe 6.

Angels in America: Deals with AIDS and homosexuality, provocative but more of a social commentary. 7?

Exorcist: Shock horror, but not necessarily challenging an institution. 4.

Fountain: 7?

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled, but let me try to finalize the scores based on this reasoning:

1. Hair: 7 (counterculture, but not as transgressive as others)
2. Ulysses: 5 (banned but literary style)
3. Piss Christ: 10 (direct religious provocation)
4. A Clockwork Orange: 9 (graphic content and themes)
5. God Save the Queen: 9 (direct attack on monarchy)
6. Exorcist: 4 (shock horror without targeting an institution)
7. Angels in America: 6 (social issues but less confrontational)
8. Fountain: 7 (form-based challenge, so less than 10 but still provocative)
