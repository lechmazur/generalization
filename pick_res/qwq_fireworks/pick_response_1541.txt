Okay, let's see. The user provided examples and anti-examples. I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples and then rate the candidates based on how well they fit that theme, avoiding the broader or related themes that the anti-examples might represent.

First, the examples are Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Carnival of Venice, and Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. Let's think about their commonalities. The Edinburgh Fringe is a performing arts festival, the Venice Carnival is a masquerade event, and the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta is a hot-air balloon event. So maybe the theme is large-scale, community-focused festivals that are unique to a specific location and have a particular traditional or cultural activity as their main feature. They might be more about arts, culture, or traditional events rather than music festivals.

Now the anti-examples are Coachella, Tomorrowland, and Mardi Gras New Orleans. Coachella and Tomorrowland are music festivals, especially electronic dance music. Mardi Gras is a carnival, but perhaps the user considers it more mainstream or part of a broader category. The anti-examples might be music-centric or more commercial, whereas the original examples are more traditional or have a specific unique activity beyond just music.

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Running of the Bulls in Pamplona: This is a traditional event, part of the San Fermín festival. It's a unique, specific activity, not a music festival. So this seems to fit the examples' theme well. Maybe a high score like 8 or 9?

2. Oktoberfest in Munich: A beer festival, traditional, specific to Munich, and a huge event. But Oktoberfest is more about beer and has a long tradition. However, it's a celebration with a specific focus, so maybe a 7 or 8?

3. Rio Carnival: The Carnival in Rio is similar to the Carnival of Venice, but the anti-example includes Mardi Gras which is another carnival. Wait, the user's anti-examples include Mardi Gras, so maybe Rio Carnival is similar to the Venice Carnival, so it should be a good fit. But the anti-examples have Mardi Gras, so maybe the user considers carnivals as part of the broader theme but Rio is still a specific carnival. Hmm. The original examples include Carnival of Venice, so Rio's Carnival would fit. So maybe 9? But wait, the anti-example Mardi Gras is a carnival but considered an anti-example, so maybe the theme is more specific than just carnivals. Wait, the examples have Carnival of Venice, so Rio's Carnival would fit the same category. So perhaps 9, but maybe lower if the user thinks it's too similar to Mardi Gras. Maybe 8?

4. Comic-Con International: This is a pop culture and comic convention. Not a traditional or cultural event, more of a convention. The examples are festivals with arts or cultural events. So Comic-Con might be an anti-example because it's more of a convention, but the user's anti-examples are music festivals. Hmm, maybe it's a lower score. Maybe 3 or 4?

5. Carnival of Brazil: Wait, the Carnival of Brazil is a broader term, but Rio's is part of that. But the user's examples include Carnival of Venice, so maybe the Carnival of Brazil (as a general term) is similar. But the anti-example is Mardi Gras, which is another carnival. Wait, maybe the specific theme is "carnivals" but the anti-examples are other carnivals? No, the user's anti-examples include Mardi Gras, so perhaps the theme isn't just carnivals. Let me think again.

Wait, the examples are Edinburgh Fringe (arts), Venice Carnival (carnival), Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta (balloon event). So the theme is large-scale festivals with a specific unique focus (arts, carnival, balloon), each being a distinct event tied to a location. The anti-examples are Coachella (music), Tomorrowland (EDM music), Mardi Gras (carnival). Wait, but Mardi Gras is a carnival like Venice. So maybe the theme is carnivals plus other specific festivals (Edinburgh Fringe, Balloon Fiesta). The anti-examples include a carnival (Mardi Gras) but maybe the specific theme is more about the non-music festivals? Or maybe the key is that the examples are not music festivals, while the anti-examples are music-focused. Let me check:

Edinburgh Fringe includes music but is broader (theater, comedy, etc.). Venice Carnival is about masks and parades. Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta is about balloons. The anti-examples are music festivals (Coachella, Tomorrowland) and Mardi Gras (which is a carnival, so maybe the user considers it part of a broader category but not the specific theme). So perhaps the specific theme is festivals that are not primarily music-focused, but have a unique cultural or traditional activity as their main attraction. 

So for the candidates:

1. Running of the Bulls: Non-music, traditional, unique activity. 9.

2. Oktoberfest: Beer festival, traditional, specific to Munich. But it's centered around beer, which is a product, but it's a big event. Maybe 8.

3. Rio Carnival: Similar to Venice, so 9? But Mardi Gras is an anti-example. Wait, maybe the user's examples include Venice Carnival, so Rio would be a good fit. So 9.

4. Comic-Con: Not a festival with traditional/cultural activity, more of a convention. So low score, maybe 2.

5. Carnival of Brazil: Like Rio's, but maybe the Carnival of Brazil as a whole is a broader term, but since it's a carnival like Venice, maybe 8? Or 9? Hmm, maybe 9.

6. Electric Daisy Carnival: Part of the name is "Carnival" but it's a music festival (EDC is EDM). So this is like Tomorrowland, an anti-example. So 0? Or maybe 1.

7. Ultra Music Festival: Definitely a music festival, so anti-example. 0 or 1.

8. South by Southwest: A music, film, and tech conference. It's a music festival component but more multi-genre and includes other aspects. Since the anti-examples are music festivals, SXSW might be a 3? Or 2?

Wait, let me reassess:

The anti-examples are Coachella (music), Tomorrowland (music), Mardi Gras (carnival). The theme examples include a carnival (Venice), a fringe festival (Edinburgh), and a balloon event (Albuquerque). The key is that the examples are not music-focused. So festivals that are primarily music would be anti-examples, even if they have other elements. So:

Candidate 6: Electric Daisy Carnival is a music festival, so 0.

Candidate 7: Ultra Miami is music, so 0.

Candidate 8: SXSW has music but also other things. Maybe 3, but since it's a music festival as a primary component, it's lower. Maybe 2.

Candidate 3: Rio Carnival is a carnival, so like Venice, so 9.

Candidate 5: Carnival of Brazil is same as Rio's Carnival? Maybe the Carnival of Brazil includes Rio, but the user's example is Venice Carnival, so Rio is a better fit. So 9.

Candidate 4: Comic-Con is a convention, not a festival with cultural/traditional activity. So 1.

Candidate 2: Oktoberfest is a beer festival, traditional, so 8.

Candidate 1: Running of the Bulls is a traditional event, so 9.

Wait but maybe the specific theme requires it to be a festival, not just an event within a larger festival? For example, the Edinburgh Fringe is part of the Edinburgh Festival but is a separate event. The Running of the Bulls is part of San Fermín festival, but maybe that's okay. The key is that each example is a specific festival with a unique focus. So the scores would be:

1. 9

2. 8

3. 9

4. 1

5. 9

6. 0

7. 0

8. 2

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be from 0-10, granular. Let me check again:

Wait, for number 5, Carnival of Brazil is a broad term, but the Carnival in Rio is part of it. But the example is Carnival of Venice, which is a specific instance. So Carnival of Brazil as a category might be broader, so maybe 8 instead of 9? Or the user might consider it a direct match. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are all annual festivals with a specific unique activity, not music-focused, and tied to their location. So:

Running of the Bulls (1) is a strong match (9)

Oktoberfest (2) is a beer festival, so 8.

Rio Carnival (3) 9.

Carnival of Brazil (5) 9.

Comic-Con (4) is a convention, so low, like 2.

Electric Daisy (6) 0.

Ultra (7) 0.

South by Southwest (8) includes music, so maybe 3.

Wait, but SXSW also has film and tech. The user's examples include Edinburgh Fringe which is multi-arts. So maybe SXSW is a bit closer but still primarily a music festival? Not sure. Maybe 3.

Alternatively, since it's a multi-genre event with music as a main component, it's more like the anti-examples, so 1.

Hmm, tricky. Let me make a final list based on this:

1. Running of the Bulls: 9

2. Oktoberfest: 8

3. Rio Carnival: 9

4. Comic-Con: 2

5. Carnival of Brazil: 9

6. Electric Daisy: 0

7. Ultra: 0

8. SXSW: 3

Wait, but the user's anti-examples include Mardi Gras as an anti-example even though it's a carnival. Wait, maybe the key difference is that the examples include the Carnival of Venice, which is a specific event, but the anti-example Mardi Gras is a carnival as well. That suggests that carnivals might not be the defining factor. Maybe the key is that the examples are not music festivals, whereas the anti-examples are music-focused. So:

Carnival of Venice is okay because it's not music-centric. So Rio and Brazil's Carnivals are okay. Mardi Gras is an anti-example because it's considered more part of a broader theme? Maybe not. Maybe the user's anti-examples include Mardi Gras because it's in the US, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the specific theme is "festivals that are the largest or most famous in their category and have a unique, non-music focus." So:

Comic-Con is a convention, so low. EDC and Ultra are music, so 0. SXSW includes music but also other things, so maybe 3.

Oktoberfest is a beer fest, so 8. Running of the Bulls is 9. Rio and Brazil's Carnivals are 9. So the scores would be as above.

Wait, but the user said to not output the theme, just the scores. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Another angle: the examples are all festivals with "Festival" in the name except Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta. The anti-examples have "Festival" in Coachella and Tomorrowland (though Tomorrowland is just named Tomorrowland). The Running of the Bulls is part of the San Fermín festival. So maybe "Festival" is part of the theme? But the user's examples include Balloon Fiesta. Maybe not.

Alternatively, the key is that they are all traditional, long-standing events. The Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta started in the 70s, Edinburgh Fringe since 1947, Venice Carnival is centuries old. The anti-examples like Coachella (since 1999) are more modern. But Mardi Gras is old. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, the examples are all non-music festivals except Edinburgh Fringe includes music but is more arts-focused. The anti-examples are music festivals. So the key is non-music festivals with unique cultural/traditional focus.

Thus:

1. Running of the Bulls: 9

2. Oktoberfest (non-music, traditional): 8

3. Rio Carnival: 9

4. Comic-Con (convention, not festival): 1

5. Carnival of Brazil: 9

6. Electric Daisy (music): 0

7. Ultra (music): 0

8. SXSW (includes music but also other stuff): 3

Wait, but SXSW has music as a major part, so maybe 2.

Alternatively, since it's a mix, maybe 4?

Hmm. Let's think again. The user wants the scores to be nuanced. Let me try to assign them step by step:

1. Running of the Bulls Pamplona: Very traditional, unique event. 9.

2. Oktoberfest: Traditional beer fest, unique to Munich. 8.

3. Rio Carnival: Major carnival, like Venice. 9.

4. Comic-Con: Not a festival in the same sense, more of a convention. 2.

5. Carnival of Brazil: Same as Rio's, so 9.

6. Electric Daisy Carnival: Music festival, so 0.

7. Ultra Music Festival Miami: Music, 0.

8. South by Southwest: Mix of music, film, tech. Since it's a music festival as part of it, but also other aspects. Maybe 3? Or 2? Since it's a multi-genre music fest, maybe 1?

Hmm. Maybe:

1. 9

2. 8

3. 9

4. 1

5. 9

6. 0

7. 0

8. 3

I think that's a reasonable spread using the scale.
