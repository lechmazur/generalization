Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given three examples (protractor, astrolabe, sundial) and three anti-examples (clock face, color wheel, dartboard). I need to figure out the specific theme that unites the examples and excludes the anti-examples.

First, looking at the examples: a protractor is a tool for measuring angles, an astrolabe is an historical instrument used for astronomy, which involves measuring angles too, and a sundial tells time using the sun's position, which also relates to angles and time measurement based on the sun's angle. So maybe the common theme is instruments that measure angles or use angular measurements for a specific purpose, like time or direction?

Now the anti-examples: a clock face shows time but isn't measuring angles directly as a tool; it's more about time display. A color wheel organizes colors, not angles. A dartboard has segments but isn't for measurement. So the key difference might be that the examples are tools designed primarily for measurement using angles, whereas the anti-examples use circular designs but aren't measurement tools in that specific way.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. Circular saw blade: It's circular and has angles in its teeth, but its primary function isn't measurement. It's for cutting. So maybe a low score, but maybe a 2? Not sure yet.

2. Compass rose: This is used on maps to indicate directions, which are angles. It's about showing cardinal directions, so maybe a good fit. Maybe a 7 or 8?

3. Roulette wheel: It's circular with numbered sections, but it's for gambling, not measurement. The numbers aren't about angles. Probably a low score like 1 or 2.

4. CD-ROM: Circular storage medium. No measurement function. 0 or 1.

5. Steering wheel: Controls a vehicle's direction, but isn't measuring angles. Maybe a 3? Not exactly a measurement tool.

6. Ship's helm: Similar to steering wheel. Controls direction but doesn't measure angles. Maybe 2 or 3.

7. Pie chart: Represents data with angles/slices, but it's a visual representation, not a measuring tool. So maybe a 4 or 5? It uses angles but isn't a tool for taking measurements.

8. Vinyl record: Plays music, circular but no measurement. 0 or 1.

Wait, but the examples include sundial which tells time via the sun's angle. A compass rose is about direction (angles), so maybe that's a 7 or 8. The pie chart uses angles to represent proportions, but is it a measurement tool? Hmm, maybe a 5. The ship's helm might be part of navigation, but it's more about control than measurement. Maybe a 3. The steering wheel is similar, so maybe 2. The saw blade's teeth have angles but not for measurement. Maybe 1. CD and vinyl are 0. Roulette wheel is 1. Let me check again.

Alternatively, the astrolabe and protractor are precise measurement tools, sundial uses the sun's angle to tell time. The compass rose is part of navigation, showing directions which are angles, so maybe 7. Pie chart uses angles to represent data, but it's a diagram, not a tool for measuring. Maybe a 4. The ship's helm might be connected to navigation but not directly measuring angles. So maybe 3. Steering wheel is control, so 2. Saw blade's angles are functional but not for measurement. 1. The rest are 0 or 1. Hmm, need to ensure the scores are spread out. Let me assign based on that.
