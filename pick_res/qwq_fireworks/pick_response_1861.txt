Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the given examples and anti-examples. The examples provided are all traditional, handcrafted items made from natural materials, used in specific cultural or ceremonial contexts. The Cherokee basket, Hopi kachina doll, and Navajo rug all share characteristics like being made from organic materials (sweetgrass, cottonwood, wool), having symbolic geometric patterns, and being used in cultural or spiritual ceremonies.

The anti-examples, on the other hand, are items like a bronze incense burner, metal menorah, and silver chalice. These are made of metal or other non-organic materials, and while they might have religious or ceremonial uses, they don't fit the specific theme because they're more generalized religious artifacts rather than being tied to specific indigenous or traditional crafts with the mentioned materials and patterns.

Now, evaluating each candidate against the specific theme:

1. **Maori carved wooden lintel with spiral patterns**: Wood is a natural material, spiral patterns are common in indigenous art, and it's part of a meeting house, which is cultural. But is it used in a specific ceremony like the examples? Maybe. So maybe a 7?

Wait, but the examples are objects used in festivals or ceremonies (harvest, healing). The lintel is part of a structure, not an object used in a ceremony. So maybe lower. Let me think again. The Cherokee basket is used in festivals, the Hopi doll is part of rituals, the Navajo rug in healing. The lintel is architectural, so perhaps less direct. Maybe a 5?

2. **Steel church bell**: Steel is a metal, so not natural material. Used in religious context but not indigenous or with the specific patterns. Definitely an anti-example style. So 0 or 1? Since anti-examples are excluded, but maybe steel is too far. 1?

3. **Marble altar**: Marble is natural but carved into an altar, which is a common religious item. The examples are more about portable objects with specific patterns. Marble altar is more general religious, so similar to anti-examples. Maybe 2?

4. **Stained glass window depicting a saint**: Stained glass is an art form, but made with glass and not natural materials like wood or grass. Depicts a saint, so religious but not aligned with the specific indigenous patterns. Maybe 3?

5. **Glass rosary**: Glass is non-organic, and a rosary is a common religious item. Not matching the materials or the cultural specificity. 1?

6. **Concrete statue of Buddha**: Concrete is a modern material, not natural. Statue is religious, but again, not the same as the examples. 0?

7. **Synthetic tapestry depicting a religious scene**: Synthetic material, not natural. The Navajo rug was natural and had specific patterns. This is synthetic and a different context (religious vs. specific indigenous ceremony). Maybe 2?

8. **Silk prayer shawl**: Silk is natural, but a prayer shawl (like a tallit) is part of Jewish tradition. It's used in religious ceremonies, but the materials might be natural. However, the patterns here might not be the same geometric ones as the examples. Maybe a 4? Or 3?

Wait, let me re-express the theme again. The specific theme is items that are handcrafted from natural materials (like grass, wood, wool), have symbolic geometric patterns (concentric circles, rain cloud designs, diamonds/zigzags), and are used in specific cultural or ceremonial events (harvest festivals, healing ceremonies, Hopi rituals). 

So the key elements are:
- Natural materials (sweetgrass, cottonwood, wool)
- Geometric patterns with cultural symbolism
- Used in specific cultural or ceremonial contexts

Now re-evaluating each candidate:

1. **Maori lintel**: Wood (natural), spiral/triangular patterns (geometric), part of a meeting house which is cultural. But is it used in a specific ceremony? The meeting house itself is part of cultural life, maybe the lintel is part of the structure, so maybe not directly used in a ceremony like the basket or rug. Still, it's close. Maybe 6 or 7? Since it's part of a cultural structure and has the right materials and patterns.

2. **Steel bell**: Metal, so not natural. Religious use but not the specific cultural context. Definitely 0 or 1. Since it's a bell, maybe 1?

3. **Marble altar**: Natural material (marble), but altars are common in many religions. Not tied to a specific indigenous group's ceremony with those patterns. Maybe 2?

4. **Stained glass**: Glass is non-natural, depicts a saint (religious figure), not geometric patterns. 1?

5. **Glass rosary**: Non-natural, religious but not the right context. 0?

6. **Concrete Buddha**: Non-natural material. 0.

7. **Synthetic tapestry**: Synthetic material, so no. Even if the scene is religious, material is key. 0 or 1? Maybe 1?

8. **Silk shawl**: Silk is natural. Prayer shawl is used in religious ceremonies, but the patterns? If it's a traditional Jewish shawl with tzitzit, maybe not the same geometric patterns. So maybe 3? Because material is natural, but patterns might not match. Alternatively, if the pattern is geometric, maybe higher? The problem states "depicting a religious scene", so perhaps not geometric. So 3?

Wait, the examples had specific patterns (concentric circles, geometric for rain clouds, diamond/zigzag). The anti-examples are items that might be religious but not tied to specific indigenous crafts. The silk shawl is part of a religious tradition but not necessarily with the same patterns. So maybe 3.

Let me adjust the scores accordingly:

1. Maori lintel: 7 (natural, patterns, cultural use)
2. Steel bell: 1 (metal, general religious)
3. Marble altar: 2 (natural but too generic)
4. Stained glass: 1 (non-natural, religious figure)
5. Glass rosary: 0 (non-natural)
6. Concrete Buddha: 0 (non-natural)
7. Synthetic tapestry: 1 (non-natural)
8. Silk shawl: 3 (natural, but not the same patterns and context)
