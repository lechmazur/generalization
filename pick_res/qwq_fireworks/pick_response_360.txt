Okay, let me start by figuring out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are viola, violin, and double bass. All of these are stringed instruments, but so are the anti-examples like lute, oud, and bouzouki. So the theme must be more specific than just string instruments. 

Looking closer, viola, violin, and double bass are all part of the orchestral string family. They're typically used in classical music ensembles. The anti-examples like lute and oud are also string instruments but from different musical traditions—like the lute is more Renaissance or Baroque, oud is Middle Eastern, and bouzouki is Greek. So maybe the theme is specifically the standard orchestral string instruments used in Western classical music.

Now, checking the candidates:

1. Charango: That's a South American instrument, smaller like a guitar or ukulele. Not part of the standard orchestra. So probably a low score, maybe 2 or 3.

2. Sitar: Indian classical music instrument. Definitely not in the Western orchestra. So maybe 1 or 2.

3. Cello: Oh, wait, cello is part of the same family as violin and viola. It's definitely in the orchestra. So that should be a 10. Wait, but the examples didn't include cello. Hmm, but the user said the theme is the specific one that includes the examples. Since cello is a direct sibling (viola, violin, cello, double bass are the four main orchestral strings), maybe it's a 10? But the user might have intended not to include it? Wait, the examples given are viola, violin, double bass. Cello is the missing fourth. So perhaps the theme is the orchestral string family, so cello is a perfect fit. So 10?

Wait, but the anti-examples are lute, oud, bouzouki. So maybe the theme is the standard Western orchestral bowed strings. Then cello is part of that. So 10. But maybe I should check other candidates first.

4. Guitar: It's a plucked string instrument, used in orchestras but not as part of the standard string section. The string section is usually violin, viola, cello, double bass. Guitar might be used in some pieces but isn't part of the core. So maybe a 4 or 5?

5. Mandolin: Plucked, similar to lute family. Not part of the orchestral strings. So maybe 1 or 2.

6. Ukulele: Small guitar-like, definitely not orchestral. 0 or 1.

7. Erhu: Chinese two-stringed fiddle. It's a bowed instrument but not part of Western orchestra. So maybe 2 or 3.

8. Balalaika: Russian triangular body string instrument. Not part of standard orchestra. Maybe 3 or 4.

Wait, but let me think again. The examples are all part of the violin family (viola, violin, double bass is a bit different but still in the same family). Cello is part of that family. So the theme is the violin family string instruments. Then cello is a 10. The others: guitar is not in that family. Mandolin is a lute family. So that's correct.

Wait, double bass is technically part of the violin family but much larger. So the theme is the violin family instruments used in orchestras. So cello is included. So 10.

Guitar is not part of that family. It's a lute family, like the anti-examples. So maybe a 0 or 1.

Charango is similar to a small guitar, so 0 or 1.

Sitar is definitely out, 0.

Mandolin is lute family, so 0-2.

Ukulele, same as guitar family, 0.

Erhu is a different tradition, so 0-2.

Balalaika is a string instrument but not in the violin family, so maybe 2?

Hmm, but I need to assign scores between 0-10, with nuance. Let me reassess each:

1. Charango: Not violin family, not orchestral. 1.

2. Sitar: Definitely not. 0.

3. Cello: Perfect match. 10.

4. Guitar: Not part of the string section in orchestra. Maybe 3?

Wait, sometimes guitar is used in orchestras but not as part of the standard strings section. So maybe 2?

5. Mandolin: Lute family, so like the anti-examples. 1.

6. Ukulele: Definitely not. 0.

7. Erhu: Bowed but different family. 1.

8. Balalaika: Plucked, different family. Maybe 2.

Wait, but let me see if there's any overlap. For example, double bass is part of the violin family but larger. The balalaika is a stringed instrument but not in that family, so lower. Maybe 2. 

Alternatively, maybe the cello is a 10, and others get lower. Let me structure the scores:

1. Charango: 1

2. Sitar: 0

3. Cello: 10

4. Guitar: 2 (since it's a string instrument but not in the family)

5. Mandolin: 1

6. Ukulele: 0

7. Erhu: 1

8. Balalaika: 2

Wait but maybe the balalaika is closer in some way? Not really. Alternatively, perhaps the guitar is a 3 because it's a stringed instrument but not bowed. Hmm, but the examples are all bowed (violin, viola, double bass). So the theme might require bowed instruments from the violin family. Then cello is 10. The others:

Guitar is plucked, so 0. But the user's anti-examples include lute (plucked), so maybe the key is the family. So the theme is violin family instruments. So any in that family get high. Cello is in the family. The others are not. So:

Guitar: 0, since it's a different family (lute). 

But maybe double bass is part of the same family, so the theme is that family. So cello is in, others not. 

Thus:

1. Charango (0)

2. Sitar (0)

3. Cello (10)

4. Guitar (0)

5. Mandolin (0)

6. Ukulele (0)

7. Erhu (0)

8. Balalaika (0)

Wait, but that's too polarized. The user said not to use just 0s and 10s. So I must have a mistake here. Maybe I misinterpreted the theme. Let me think again.

The examples are viola, violin, double bass. All are part of the standard orchestral string section. The anti-examples are lute, oud, bouzouki, which are plucked and from other traditions.

So the theme might be "standard Western orchestral string instruments that are bowed." Thus:

Cello is part of that, so 10.

Guitar is plucked and not in the section, so 0.

Mandolin is plucked and not in the section, so 0.

Erhu is bowed but not Western, so maybe 2?

Balalaika is plucked, so 0.

Charango is plucked, 0.

Sitar is plucked and non-Western, 0.

Ukulele, same as guitar, 0.

Wait but the user wants a nuanced score. Maybe some get 1 or 2. For example, the balalaika is a string instrument but not part of the orchestral family. Maybe a 1?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "members of the violin family". The violin family includes violin, viola, cello, double bass. So cello is 10, and the others are 0 except maybe if any others are in that family. But none of the candidates except cello are in that family. So the rest would be 0 except maybe the double bass is an example, but it's already given. Wait the candidates don't include double bass again. 

Wait the candidates are the ones listed. So for the given candidates, only cello is a 10. The rest are 0-2. But the user wants a range from 0 to 10. Maybe I need to consider other factors. For instance, some might be closer in structure. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments played with a bow in Western classical music". Then cello is 10, erhu is a bow but non-Western, so maybe 3? Balalaika is plucked, so 0. Guitar is plucked, 0. Mandolin plucked, 0. Charango plucked, 0. Sitar plucked, 0. Ukulele plucked, 0. 

But then erhu would get a 3. That might make sense. The user said anti-examples are lute, oud, bouzouki (plucked, non-Western), so the theme is bowed and Western. So erhu is bowed but not Western, so maybe 4? Hmm. 

Alternatively, the theme is "members of the violin family". So only cello is in that family. The others are all not. So they get 0 except cello. But the user wants the scores to use the full range. 

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. The examples are viola, violin, double bass. All are chordophones (string instruments) with a neck, played with a bow, and part of the standard orchestral strings. The anti-examples are lute, oud, bouzouki—plucked, lute family, non-orchestral. 

So the theme is: bowed, part of the Western classical orchestra's string section, and from the violin family (violin, viola, cello, double bass). 

Thus, candidates:

1. Charango: plucked, South American. 0.

2. Sitar: plucked, Indian. 0.

3. Cello: yes, 10.

4. Guitar: plucked, not part of the string section. 0.

5. Mandolin: plucked, lute family. 0.

6. Ukulele: plucked, small guitar. 0.

7. Erhu: bowed but Chinese, not Western. Maybe 2? Because it's bowed but outside the family.

8. Balalaika: plucked, Russian. 0 or 1.

Wait, but the user wants nuanced scores. Maybe:

Erhu gets a 2 because it's a bowed string but non-Western.

Balalaika: 1 because it's a string instrument but not bowed or in the right family.

Others are 0. 

Cello 10. 

So the scores would be:

1. 0

2. 0

3. 10

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 2

8. 1

But that's still mostly 0s and a few low scores. The user said to use the full range. Maybe I need to consider another angle. Perhaps the theme is "string instruments with four strings" or something else? Let's check the examples:

Violin has 4 strings, viola 4, double bass 4 or 5. Cello has 4. Guitar has 6, mandolin 8, etc. Not sure. 

Alternatively, the examples are all part of the "violin" family, which includes violin, viola, cello, double bass. So the theme is being a member of that family. Thus, cello is 10, others are 0 except if any are in that family. None of the candidates except cello are in that family. So the rest are 0. But the user wants a range. Maybe the balalaika is a bit similar in shape but not. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments played with a bow". Then erhu would be 8, cello 10, etc. But then the anti-examples include plucked, so the theme would exclude them. But the anti-examples are not part of the theme but are in a broader category. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments used in Western classical music orchestras". Then cello is 10, erhu (non-Western) 0, guitar is sometimes used but not standard, so maybe 3. Mandolin? Not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all instruments that are part of the "orchestral strings section" which includes violin, viola, cello, double bass. Thus, cello is 10, others are 0. But the user wants scores across the range. 

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that some candidates are closer in other aspects. For instance, the balalaika is a stringed instrument but plucked. So maybe a 1. The charango is a small stringed instrument, so 1. The sitar is a lute-like but with more strings, so 0. 

Alternatively, the user might have intended a different theme. Let me think again: the examples are all from the violin family. The anti-examples are lute family. So the theme is violin family. Thus, only cello is in that family (so 10), others are 0 except maybe double bass is already given. 

But the candidates don't include double bass again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "string instruments that are not plucked". Then the examples are bowed, anti-examples are plucked. So candidates:

Cello: 10 (bowed).

Erhu: 10 (bowed), but it's non-Western. Wait but the anti-examples include plucked instruments. So the theme would exclude non-Western? Or just exclude plucked. 

If the theme is "bowed string instruments", then erhu and cello would be high. But the anti-examples are plucked. 

Wait the anti-examples are lute, oud, bouzouki, which are plucked, so the theme must exclude them. So the theme could be "bowed string instruments used in Western classical music". Then:

Cello: 10.

Erhu: 2 (bowed but non-Western).

Guitar: 0 (plucked).

Mandolin: 0 (plucked).

Balalaika: 0 (plucked).

Charango: 0 (plucked).

Sitar: 0 (plucked).

Ukulele: 0 (plucked).

So that gives some variation. 

In that case:

1. Charango (plucked, non-West): 0.

2. Sitar (plucked, non-West): 0.

3. Cello (bowed, West): 10.

4. Guitar (plucked, West but not classical strings): 1? Or 0.

Wait guitar can be in classical music but not as part of the string section. Maybe 2.

5. Mandolin (plucked, lute family): 0.

6. Ukulele (plucked, small guitar): 0.

7. Erhu (bowed, non-West): 3.

8. Balalaika (plucked): 0.

But then scores would be:

1:0, 2:0, 3:10,4:2,5:0,6:0,7:3,8:0.

This uses some numbers but maybe not the full range. Alternatively, maybe the balalaika is considered a bit closer? 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments with a neck and resonator, played with a bow, and part of the Western classical tradition". 

In that case, only cello (10). 

Alternatively, maybe the user's theme is "string instruments that are part of the standard symphony orchestra's string section". That would include violin, viola, cello, double bass. So cello is 10, others 0 except maybe the guitar which is sometimes used but not standard. So guitar might get a 1 or 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "string instruments that are fretless and bowed", then cello (10), erhu (bowed but fretted? No, erhu has no frets. Wait, erhu is fretless. So erhu would be 9? But non-Western. Hmm. 

Alternatively, the theme is "members of the violin family", so cello is 10. 

Given the user's instructions, I think the safest is to assume the theme is the violin family (violin, viola, cello, double bass). Thus, only cello gets 10, others 0. But that's too polarized. 

Alternatively, perhaps the examples are all "string instruments with a curved bridge", but not sure. 

Wait maybe the theme is "string instruments that are part of the standard quartet (violin, viola, cello, double bass)". So quartet instruments. Then cello is 10, others 0 except none. 

Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake, but I need to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments that are not plucked and have a specific number of strings". But violin, viola, cello have 4, double bass has 4 or 5. 

Alternatively, the theme is "string instruments that are part of the orchestral string section". Thus:

Cello (10), others are not. 

Guitar is sometimes used in orchestras but not as part of the string section. Maybe 2.

Erhu is not part of it, so 0.

Balalaika: 0.

Sitar:0.

Ukulele:0.

Mandolin:0.

Charango:0.

Thus:

3. Cello 10

4. Guitar 2

others 0.

But that still has mostly 0s. 

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that some instruments are similar in shape or structure. For instance, the balalaika has a triangular body, but that's different. 

Alternatively, the theme might be "string instruments that are part of the violin superfamily", which includes some others. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "string instruments with a neck and a resonator, played with a bow, and used in classical music". Then erhu is a bowed string used in classical Chinese music, so maybe 7? But the anti-examples include lute which is plucked, so maybe the theme requires Western. 

If the theme requires Western classical tradition, then erhu is out. 

In that case, perhaps:

Cello 10.

Guitar: sometimes in orchestras but not part of the string section, so 3.

Balalaika: 0.

Erhu:0.

Charango:0.

Sitar:0.

Mandolin:0.

Ukulele:0.

This way, only Cello is 10, Guitar gets 3, others 0. Still not full range.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments that are part of the standard Western classical orchestra's string section". So:

Cello (10), Violin (given as example), Viola (example), Double bass (example). 

Candidates not in examples:

Guitar is sometimes used but not part of the core section. Maybe 2.

Others are 0.

Thus, scores:

1. Charango:0

2. Sitar:0

3. Cello:10

4. Guitar:2

5. Mandolin:0

6. Ukulele:0

7. Erhu:0

8. Balalaika:0

Still mostly 0s and 10 and 2. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments that are fretted or unfretted". But violin family are unfretted, while the anti-examples are fretted (lute, oud, bouzouki). So the theme is unfretted. Thus:

Cello (unfretted):10.

Guitar is fretted:0.

Mandolin fretted:0.

Ukulele fretted:0.

Erhu unfretted: maybe 8? Since it's unfretted but non-Western. 

Charango is fretted:0.

Sitar has frets:0.

Balalaika fretted:0.

So:

3:10,7:8, others 0.

This gives some variation. 

Alternatively, the theme is "unfretted, bowed string instruments in Western classical music". Then:

Cello:10.

Erhu: non-Western, so maybe 4.

Guitar: plucked and fretted:0.

So:

7:4, 3:10, others 0.

This uses some scores. 

I think I need to proceed with this approach. Let me try to assign scores based on being part of the Western classical bowed string family (violin family):

Cello is 10.

Others are 0 except:

Erhu is a non-Western bowed string. So maybe 2.

Balalaika is plucked, but maybe 1.

Charango is plucked, 0.

Sitar:0.

Guitar: plucked, 0.

Mandolin: plucked, 0.

Ukulele:0.

So:

1. Charango:0

2. Sitar:0

3. Cello:10

4. Guitar:0

5. Mandolin:0

6. Ukulele:0

7. Erhu:2

8. Balalaika:1

That uses 0,1,2,10. 

Alternatively, maybe the balalaika is 1, charango 0, others 0 except erhu 2.

But the user wants the full range. Hmm. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "string instruments in the violin family", so only cello is 10. The others are 0 except maybe some are close. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments played with a bow in Western music". So erhu is non-Western, so 3. Cello 10. 

Guitar: plucked, 0.

Balalaika: plucked, 0.

Sitar: plucked, 0.

Mandolin: plucked, 0.

Charango: plucked,0.

Ukulele:0.

Thus:

3:10,7:3, others 0.

Still limited. 

Given the instructions, I think I need to proceed with the following approach: the theme is the violin family (violin, viola, cello, double bass). Thus:

Cello is 10.

Others are 0 except maybe some get 1 or 2 if they are string instruments but not in the family. 

Alternatively, the balalaika is a Russian string instrument but not in the family. So maybe 1.

Erhu is Chinese, so 1.

Charango is South American, 0.

Sitar is Indian,0.

Guitar is Western but not in the family, so maybe 1.

Mandolin is Western but lute family, so 1.

Ukulele:1.

Thus:

3:10

Others:

1. Charango:0

2. Sitar:0

4. Guitar:1

5. Mandolin:1

6. Ukulele:1

7. Erhu:1

8. Balalaika:1

This way, scores are 0,1,10. 

Alternatively, maybe give some higher scores for those closer to the theme. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "string instruments used in orchestras", which includes some others like guitar sometimes. 

If that's the case, then:

Cello:10.

Guitar:3 (sometimes used but not standard).

Others:0.

But that still limited.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to assign scores based on how closely they fit the violin family:

3. Cello is 10.

Others:

7. Erhu is a two-stringed bowed instrument but not Western, so maybe 2.

8. Balalaika is plucked, triangular body, so 1.

4. Guitar is plucked, so 0.

5. Mandolin is plucked and lute family, so 0.

1. Charango: plucked small guitar, 0.

2. Sitar: plucked, 0.

6. Ukulele: plucked,0.

Thus:

3:10,7:2,8:1, others 0.

That uses 0,1,2,10. Maybe also:

Guitar is sometimes in orchestras, so 1.

Mandolin in some orchestras? Maybe 0.5 but can't do fractions.

Alternatively:

Guitar:1, Mandolin:0, etc.

So final scores:

1. Charango:0

2. Sitar:0

3. Cello:10

4. Guitar:1

5. Mandolin:0

6. Ukulele:0

7. Erhu:2

8. Balalaika:1

This uses 0,1,2,10.

The user wants the full range, but maybe I need to give some higher scores to others. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments with a neck and played with a bow". Then:

Cello:10.

Erhu:9 (since it's bowed, but non-Western).

Guitar:0.

Balalaika:0.

So:

7:9,3:10, others 0.

This gives 9,10,0.

Alternatively, the theme is "Western classical bowed string instruments". 

Cello:10.

Erhu:0 (non-West).

Balalaika:0 (plucked).

Guitar:0.

So:

3:10, others 0 except maybe some get 1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "string instruments with four strings". 

Violin:4, viola:4, double bass:4 or 5. Cello:4.

So candidates:

Cello:10.

Guitar:6 strings, so 7?

Mandolin:8 strings, so 6?

Ukulele:4 strings, so 9?

Erhu:2 strings, so 5?

Charango:10 strings? Wait, charango typically has 10 strings. So 5.

Sitar:7 strings, so 6.

Balalaika:3 strings, so 4.

Thus:

1. Charango (10 strings) → 5

2. Sitar (7) →6

3. Cello (4) →10

4. Guitar (6) →7

5. Mandolin (8) →6

6. Ukulele (4) →9

7. Erhu (2) →4

8. Balalaika (3) →3

This uses a range from 3 to 10, which fits the user's request. But is this the correct theme? The examples have 4 strings (violin, viola, double bass has 4 or 5). Cello has 4. The anti-examples: lute (6), oud (5 or 6), bouzouki (8). So maybe the theme is "string instruments with 4 strings used in Western classical orchestras". Then:

Cello:10.

Ukulele has 4 but is not orchestral → maybe 5.

Guitar (6) → lower, maybe 3.

Erhu (2) → 2.

Charango (10) →0.

Sitar (7) →1.

Mandolin (8) →1.

Balalaika (3) →0.

Thus:

1. Charango:0

2. Sitar:1

3. Cello:10

4. Guitar:3

5. Mandolin:1

6. Ukulele:5

7. Erhu:2

8. Balalaika:0

This gives a range from 0 to 10. Maybe this is better. But I'm not sure if the theme is based on number of strings. The examples include double bass which can have 4 or 5 strings. So maybe it's not strictly 4. 

Alternatively, the theme is "string instruments with a neck, played with a bow, and part of the Western classical tradition". 

Cello:10.

Erhu: non-Western →2.

Guitar: plucked →0.

Mandolin: plucked →0.

Balalaika: plucked →0.

Sitar: plucked →0.

Charango: plucked →0.

Ukulele: plucked →0.

Thus, only Cello is 10, Erhu 2, others 0.

Hmm, this is the best I can think of. The user wants the full range, but given the examples and anti-examples, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "string instruments that are part of the standard symphony orchestra's string section", so:

Cello:10.

Double bass is an example, so that's included. The candidates not in examples are others. 

Guitar: sometimes used but not part of the string section →1.

Erhu: no →0.

Balalaika: no →0.

Thus:

3:10,4:1, others 0.

Still limited. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "string instruments in the violin family", so only cello is 10, others 0 except maybe double bass but it's already given. 

Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the initial assumption that the theme is the violin family (violin, viola, cello, double bass), so only cello is 10, others 0 except some get 1 or 2 for being string instruments but not in the family. 

Final scores:

1. Charango (plucked, non-West):0

2. Sitar (plucked, non-West):0

3. Cello (violin family):10

4. Guitar (plucked):0

5. Mandolin (plucked):0

6. Ukulele (plucked):0

7. Erhu (bowed but non-West):2

8. Balalaika (plucked):1

This uses 0,1,2,10. It's not the full range but better than all 0s except 10. Alternatively, maybe give some higher scores for other aspects. 

Wait, perhaps the balalaika is closer to the violin family in shape? Not really. 

Alternatively, the guitar is a string instrument, so 1.

Thus:

4. Guitar:1

So scores:

1:0,2:0,3:10,4:1,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:1.

That's better. 

I think that's the best I can do.
