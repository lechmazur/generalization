Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user gave me examples and anti-examples, and I need to score the candidates based on a specific theme. First, I need to figure out what the theme is from the examples provided.

The examples are Leonardo da Vinci's helicopter design, Alan Turing's universal computing machine, and Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. All of these are notable for being visionary or conceptual designs that were ahead of their time, but not necessarily implemented or practical during their creators' lifetimes. Da Vinci's helicopter was a design that couldn't be built with the technology of his time. Turing's machine was a theoretical concept that laid the groundwork for computers but wasn't a physical machine he built. Babbage's Analytical Engine was a design for a mechanical computer that was never fully constructed.

The anti-examples are Bell's telephone, Edison's light bulb, and the Wright brothers' airplane. These are all practical inventions that were successfully implemented and had immediate real-world applications. So the theme seems to be about conceptual or theoretical designs that were visionary but not practically realized at the time, as opposed to actual inventions that worked and were used.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. James Watt's steam engine: Watt improved the steam engine, making it practical. His design was implemented and became widely used, so this is more like the anti-examples. So probably a low score.

2. Benjamin Franklin's lightning rod: Franklin actually developed and implemented the lightning rod. It was practical and immediately useful. Another anti-example, so low score.

3. Samuel Morse's telegraph: Morse developed a working telegraph system, including the code. It was a practical invention, so anti-example. Low score.

4. Galileo's telescope: Galileo improved the telescope and used it for observations. He built actual telescopes, so this is a practical invention. Anti-example, low score.

5. Nikola Tesla's wireless power transmission system: Tesla designed and experimented with wireless power, but it wasn't practically implemented on a large scale in his time. His ideas were ahead of their time and theoretical. This seems closer to the theme examples. Maybe a higher score.

6. Johannes Gutenberg's printing press: The printing press was a revolutionary invention that was successfully built and used. Definitely practical, so anti-example. Low score.

7. George Eastman's camera: Eastman's Kodak camera made photography accessible and was a practical product. So anti-example, low score.

8. Karl Benz's automobile: Benz created the first practical automobile, which was used and became the basis for cars. Practical invention, so anti-example. Low score.

Wait, but let me double-check Tesla's wireless power. Tesla did build some experimental setups, like the Wardenclyffe Tower, but it wasn't a commercial success and didn't become practical in his lifetime. So that's similar to da Vinci's helicopter. That should be a better match. So Tesla's might be a 7 or 8?

Wait, the examples are all from people whose concepts were not fully realized. Da Vinci's helicopter wasn't built, Turing's machine was theoretical, Babbage's engine wasn't completed. So Tesla's system, while he tried to build it, it didn't become practical. So that's a good match. So maybe a 8?

But the other candidates are all practical except maybe Tesla. Let's see:

James Watt's steam engine was an improvement but was built and used, so 0 or 1. Franklin's lightning rod was practical, so 0. Morse's telegraph was real, so 0. Galileo's telescope was built, so 0. Gutenberg's press was real, 0. Eastman's camera, 0. Benz's car, 0. Tesla's wireless is the only one that's visionary but not realized. So maybe Tesla gets a 9 or 10? Wait, but Turing's machine was theoretical, not built, so maybe Tesla's is similar. But maybe there's a nuance. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "premature concepts that were later foundational"? Like da Vinci's helicopter inspired later designs, Turing's machine is the foundation of computers, Babbage's engine for programmable computers. So Tesla's wireless power transmission might be similar in that it was a foundational idea but not realized then, and now wireless power is a thing but not in his time. So Tesla's would be a 9 or 10?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "conceptual designs that were never actually built by their creators"? Then Watt's steam engine was built, so 0. Franklin's was built, 0. Morse's telegraph was built, 0. Galileo's telescope, built, 0. Gutenberg's press built, 0. Eastman's camera built, 0. Benz's car built, 0. Tesla's wireless transmission system? He did some prototypes but not a full system. So maybe a 8?

Alternatively, maybe the examples are all "theoretical inventions by individuals that were not feasible at the time but were precursors to modern tech". So Tesla's wireless power would fit here, so maybe 8 or 9. The other candidates are all successful inventions, so 0-2.

Wait, the anti-examples are Bell, Edison, Wright. So Bell's telephone was a real invention, so the anti-examples are practical and successful. The theme is the opposite: conceptual but not realized. So the only candidate that fits is Tesla's wireless. So Tesla gets 10? But maybe not exactly. Let me check the examples again. Da Vinci's helicopter wasn't built, Turing's machine was a theoretical concept (he didn't build a physical one, though the Bombe was a different machine). Babbage's Analytical Engine was designed but not completed. So Tesla's wireless system, which he did attempt but didn't achieve practical use, would be similar. So maybe 9 or 10. But perhaps the others are all 0 except that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the candidates have some nuances.

Wait, let's see the candidates again:

1. James Watt's steam engine: He improved the Newcomen engine, making it practical. So definitely an actual invention. So 0.

2. Benjamin Franklin's lightning rod: Practical, so 0.

3. Samuel Morse's telegraph: Built, so 0.

4. Galileo's telescope: He built it, so 0.

5. Nikola Tesla's wireless power transmission: He did some experiments (like the Wardenclyffe Tower), but it wasn't commercially viable or widely adopted in his time. So similar to the examples. Maybe 8 or 9.

6. Gutenberg's press: Built and used, 0.

7. Eastman's camera: Practical, 0.

8. Benz's automobile: Built and used, 0.

So Tesla's would be the highest, maybe 9? The examples are all 10s. Wait, the user said to use the full range. The anti-examples are 0. So perhaps Tesla's is 9, and others 0 except maybe some others?

Wait, is there another candidate that might be a better fit? Let me see again. Maybe Galileo's telescope? No, he built it. Maybe Gutenberg's? No. So only Tesla's wireless is the candidate. So 5 gets 9. The rest 0 except maybe someone else?

Wait, what about George Eastman's camera? He made photography accessible, but maybe his camera was a practical invention. So no. Then the only one is Tesla. So 5 is 9. The rest are 0. But the user wants the scores to be granular, not all 0 or 10. Maybe some others have a slight connection?

Wait, maybe Samuel Morse's telegraph? Wait, Morse's telegraph was a working system. So no. Maybe Galileo's telescope was an improvement but still practical. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "inventions related to information processing or computation"? But Turing and Babbage are clearly in that category. Da Vinci's helicopter is not. So that can't be. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "inventions that were theoretical or on paper but not built", so the examples are all that. So Tesla's wireless is the only one. So 9. The rest 0 except perhaps others?

Wait, maybe Galileo's telescope was an improvement but still built. So no. So only Tesla. So I'll go with that. Then the scores would be:

1. 0

2.0

3.0

4.0

5.9

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user said to use the full range. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Let's see if any other candidates could be considered.

What about George Eastman's camera? His Kodak camera was the first to make photography accessible, but it was a practical invention. So no.

Wait, maybe the Wright brothers' airplane is an anti-example, so Benz's automobile is similar to that, so 0.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "inventions that were conceptual but not realized in their time but laid the foundation for future tech". In that case, Tesla's wireless power is a good match. Maybe Galileo's telescope was foundational, but it was built, so not. So Tesla is the only one. So 9. The rest 0-1 except that.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "inventions that were not immediately practical but later became important"? Then perhaps the candidates could have some. But the examples are all from people whose work wasn't realized in their time. So maybe the key is that the original examples were not built or functional at the time. So Tesla's system wasn't functional then, so that's a 9 or 10. The others are built, so 0.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "designs by Renaissance figures or earlier"? But da Vinci is Renaissance, Turing and Babbage are later. So that's not it.

Alternatively, the theme could be "theoretical or conceptual inventions in the realm of machinery or computing". Then maybe Tesla's wireless is more in the machinery realm. Hmm.

Alternatively, the theme is "inventions that were proposed but not built by the inventor". Da Vinci's helicopter was a design but not built. Turing's machine was a theoretical concept. Babbage's engine was designed but not completed. So the key is that the inventor didn't actually build a working version. So in that case, Tesla's wireless system: he did build some prototypes (like the Wardenclyffe Tower) but didn't create a practical system. So maybe a 8 or 9.

James Watt's steam engine was built and used, so 0. Franklin's lightning rod was built. Morse's telegraph was built. Galileo's telescope was built. Gutenberg's press was built. Eastman's camera was built. Benz's automobile was built. So only Tesla's is the one not built as a practical system. So 9.

Wait, but maybe some others have a partial fit. For example, maybe the lightning rod was a concept that was quickly implemented, so it's an anti-example. The others are all practical. So yeah, only Tesla's wireless power is a 9. The rest are 0. But the user wants the scores to use the full range, so maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "inventions that were conceptual but later became the basis for modern technology". In that case, maybe the printing press (Gutenberg) is foundational, but it was built and used, so it's an anti-example. So still only Tesla.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "inventions that were theoretical or on paper but not realized in their time". So Tesla's wireless power fits. So 9. The rest 0. But the user's examples are all 10, and anti-examples 0, so maybe the scores need to be spread out more. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe some candidates are partially related. For instance, Galileo's telescope was an improvement but maybe the concept was borrowed from others? Not sure. The problem says to base it on the examples. So I think I should stick with Tesla's getting a 9 and others 0 except maybe someone else?

Wait, looking at the examples again:

Leonardo's helicopter design (not built, conceptual)

Turing's universal machine (theoretical, not built as a physical machine)

Babbage's Analytical Engine (designed but not completed)

So the key is that the invention was either purely theoretical, or designed but not built/functional in the inventor's time.

So for candidates:

1. James Watt: His steam engine was built and functional. So 0.

2. Franklin's lightning rod: Built, so 0.

3. Morse's telegraph: Built, so 0.

4. Galileo's telescope: Built, so 0.

5. Tesla's wireless: He built some prototypes but it wasn't functional as a system then. So maybe 8 or 9.

6. Gutenberg's: Built, 0.

7. Eastman's camera: Built, 0.

8. Benz's car: Built, 0.

Thus, only Tesla gets a high score. So 5:9. The rest 0 except maybe some others? Let me think again. Maybe someone else has a design that was not built.

Wait, George Eastman's camera: he invented the roll film and the Kodak camera, which was a practical product. So no. Karl Benz's automobile was the first, but it was built. So no.

Hmm, so the only one is Tesla. So the scores would be 0 for all except Tesla's 9. But the user wants the scores to be granular, not just 0 and 10. Maybe there are other candidates that have a slight connection but not as strong?

Wait, maybe the theme is "inventions in the field of computing or aviation/aeronautics"? But da Vinci's helicopter is aeronautics, Turing and Babbage are computing. So maybe the theme is a combination. But the anti-examples include the airplane, so that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "inventions that were not immediately successful but later recognized as important". But again, the examples were not built at all, so that might not fit.

Alternatively, the theme is "inventions that were visionary but impractical at the time". So Tesla's wireless was visionary but impractical then. So that's a good fit. The others are practical, so 0. So 9.

Alternatively, maybe the Wright brothers' airplane is an anti-example because it was successful, so Benz's automobile is similar, so 0. So yeah.

Alright, I'll proceed with that reasoning.
