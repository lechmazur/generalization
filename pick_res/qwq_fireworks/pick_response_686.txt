Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are Neural networks in AI processing info, Blockchain for secure distributed data transactions, and HTML used in web pages. 

Hmm, so what's common here? Neural networks are a subset of AI that process information, blockchain is a technology enabling secure, decentralized data transactions, and HTML is a markup language for structuring web content. All three are technologies or systems that handle data in some structured or processed way, especially in the context of information technology, maybe even digital systems. They all seem to involve some form of structured data processing, security in transactions (blockchain), or foundational digital infrastructure (HTML). 

Now the anti-examples are linear TV, radio signals, and live sports broadcasts. These are more about one-way transmission of media or real-time events without the structured data processing or the underlying tech infrastructure like the examples. So the theme isn't just about transmitting data but more about specific technologies that process, secure, or structure data in a digital context.

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Podcast episode: It's an audio file, usually digital. But it's similar to a radio broadcast (anti-example). But maybe since it's digital and can be processed (like via AI for transcripts?), but the podcast itself is just content. Not sure. Maybe a 3 or 4?

2. Traditional printed book: Definitely physical, no digital processing. So probably a 0 or 1. Since it's not digital or using any of those technologies.

3. Morse code transmission: It's a form of encoding, but it's a communication method, like radio signals. Not using neural networks, blockchain, or HTML. So maybe a 1 or 2? It's a data transmission but not structured in the same way as the examples.

4. Video conference call: Uses real-time data transmission, maybe some processing (like video compression, encryption). Video conferencing could involve some of the underlying tech like secure data (like blockchain aspects?), but it's more of an application. Maybe a 5 or 6?

5. Streaming music service: This is digital, uses data transmission. It might use things like encryption (secure?), but it's more about delivering content. Similar to the anti-example of radio, but digital. Maybe a 4?

6. Graph databases managing connected data: Graph databases are a type of database designed for connected data, which is similar to how HTML structures data (though HTML is markup vs. database). Blockchain also deals with transactions which are connected. Neural networks process information which can be relational. So this might be a strong match. Maybe an 8 or 9?

7. Fax machine transmission: Similar to the anti-examples, it's a transmission method, outdated, not using modern digital structures. Maybe 1 or 2?

8. Satellite communication system: It's a method of transmitting data, like radio signals but via satellite. It's more about the infrastructure for transmission rather than processing/structuring data. So maybe 2 or 3?

Wait, let me reassess each:

1. Podcast: Stored digital file. Maybe processed by platforms, but the podcast itself isn't a tech that processes info. So lower. Maybe 3.

2. Printed book: No tech, just physical. 0.

3. Morse code: Encoding method, but not part of the specific tech examples. 1.

4. Video conference: Uses data transmission with some processing (compression, encryption), maybe part of the broader theme but not the specific. Maybe 5.

5. Streaming music: Uses data streams, but not the structured processing. Maybe 4.

6. Graph databases: Definitely a data management tech, so close to the examples. 9?

7. Fax: Outdated transmission, not matching. 1.

8. Satellite: Communication infrastructure, not processing or structuring data. 2.

Hmm, but maybe the satellite system could involve secure data transmission (like blockchain's secure aspect) but it's more the medium than the tech. So 2.

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 0

3. 1

4. 5

5. 4

6. 9

7. 1

8. 2

Wait, the anti-examples are things like linear TV, radio, live sports broadcast. So podcast is digital and stored, not linear broadcast, so maybe a bit better than the anti-examples. So podcast might be a 3 or 4. Streaming music is digital, but similar to radio but on-demand, so maybe a 4.

Video conference uses real-time data, maybe some processing, but not exactly like neural networks or blockchains. So 5.

Graph DB is definitely a data structure, so 9.

Fax is like the anti-example, so 1.

Satellite is transmission, so 2.

Morse code is similar to radio, so 1.

Printed book is 0.

Yes, that seems right.
