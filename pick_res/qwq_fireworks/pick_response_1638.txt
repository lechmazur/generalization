Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided three examples of a specific theme: New York Point, Moon type, and Boston Line Type. Then there are anti-examples like Morse code, Semaphore, and Semaphore flags, which don't fit the exact theme but are related in a broader sense. The task is to evaluate the given candidates on a scale from 0 to 10 based on how well they fit the specific theme, not the broader ones.

First, I need to figure out what the common theme is among the examples. Let's look at each example:

1. **New York Point**: I recall that New York Point is a braille shorthand system developed for faster writing. It uses a different system than standard braille.
2. **Moon type**: Moon type is another tactile writing system designed for the blind, created in the 19th century. It's an alternative to braille, with simpler shapes.
3. **Boston Line Type**: This is an early embossed alphabet for the blind, pre-dating braille. It uses raised lines and shapes instead of dots.

So, the common theme here seems to be **tactile writing systems designed specifically for the blind**, but not necessarily the most common ones (like standard Braille). The anti-examples (Morse code, Semaphore) are communication systems but not tactile or for the blind. 

Now, let's analyze each candidate:

1. **Finger spelling**: This is part of sign languages (like ASL) where letters are spelled out with hand shapes. It's not a tactile writing system but a part of sign language. However, it's used by the deaf, not necessarily for the blind. So maybe a lower score, but related to communication for disabled individuals. But since the examples are tactile writing for the blind, this might be a 0-3.

2. **Unified English Braille**: This is a standardized form of Braille for English. Since Braille is a tactile system for the blind, this should be a strong candidate. But the examples include alternatives to standard Braille (like New York Point and Moon type). Since UEB is standard Braille, maybe it's part of the broader category but not the specific theme (since the examples are alternatives to standard Braille). Hmm, maybe a 6-7?

3. **SignWriting**: A writing system for sign languages. Again, for the deaf, not tactile. So probably a low score, maybe 1-2.

4. **American Braille**: This is another term for standard Braille in the US. Similar to #2, so maybe 6-7?

5. **Braille**: The standard system itself. Again, the examples are alternatives to it, so maybe it's part of the broader theme but not the specific one. So perhaps a 5?

6. **Sign language**: Like ASL, used by the deaf community. Not tactile writing for the blind. So very low, maybe 0-1.

7. **Haptic communication**: This involves touch but is a broader category. It could include things like tactile signals, but not necessarily a writing system. Maybe 3-4?

8. **Shorthand**: Systems like Gregg shorthand are for quick writing, but they're visual, not tactile. The examples are tactile systems for the blind. So probably a low score, maybe 1-2.

Wait, but let's think again. The examples are all tactile writing systems for the blind, but alternatives to Braille. So the theme is "tactile writing systems for the blind that are not standard Braille". So standard Braille (candidates 2,4,5) would be part of the broader theme but not the specific theme. So they should score lower than the examples but higher than the anti-examples.

But the anti-examples (Morse, Semaphore) are communication systems not for the blind. So candidates that are tactile writing systems for the blind but standard Braille would be in the broader category (since the specific theme is the alternatives to Braille). Therefore:

- Candidates that are alternatives to Braille (like the examples) would be 10. But since we don't have those, the closest would be things like Moon type, which are already examples. The given candidates include Unified English Braille (standard), American Braille (same as Braille), so they might be lower. 

Wait, the task says the examples are part of the specific theme, so the theme is "tactile writing systems for the blind that are alternatives to standard Braille (like Moon type, New York Point, Boston Line Type)". Therefore:

- Braille itself (candidates 2,4,5) are part of the broader theme (tactile systems for the blind) but not the specific theme (the alternatives). So they should score lower, maybe around 5 or so.

- Shorthand (candidate 8) is not tactile, so 0-2.

Finger spelling (candidate 1): part of sign language, not tactile writing, so 0-1.

SignWriting (3) and Sign language (6): same, 0-1.

Haptic communication (7): if it's a system like Braille but not, maybe 3?

Wait, perhaps Haptic communication is broader. The examples are specific tactile writing systems. Haptic could include things like Braille, but also other touch-based systems. Since it's a category, maybe it's too broad, so lower.

Alternatively, maybe Haptic is a system, but not sure. Let me think again.

Let me list each candidate with possible scores:

1. Finger spelling: Part of sign language (visual, for deaf). Not tactile writing for blind. So 0-2.

2. Unified English Braille: Standard Braille. The examples are alternatives to Braille, so this is the standard, so it's part of the broader theme but not the specific. Maybe 5?

3. SignWriting: Writing system for sign languages. Not tactile, so 0.

4. American Braille: Same as standard Braille in the US. So same as #2, 5.

5. Braille: The standard system. So same as 5.

6. Sign language: Not tactile, 0.

7. Haptic communication: Broad category. The examples are specific systems. Maybe 3?

8. Shorthand: Visual, not tactile. 0-1.

Wait, but maybe shorthand like Moon type or Boston Line Type are considered shorthand? Moon type is an alternative to Braille, but perhaps "shorthand" in the candidate refers to writing systems for speed, not for the blind. The examples are for the blind. So shorthand (like Gregg) is for sighted people, so 0.

Alternatively, maybe "Boston Line Type" is a type of shorthand? Not sure. The key is that the specific theme is tactile writing systems for the blind that are alternatives to Braille. So any system that fits that is a good score. Candidates that are such systems would get high scores, but none of the candidates except maybe Haptic communication?

Wait, Haptic communication could include Braille and alternatives, but it's a category. So maybe 2.

Alternatively, maybe "Unified English Braille" is part of the broader theme but not the specific. So:

1. Finger spelling: 1

2. Unified English Braille: 5

3. SignWriting: 0

4. American Braille: 5

5. Braille: 5

6. Sign language: 0

7. Haptic communication: 3

8. Shorthand: 0

Wait, but maybe Haptic communication is a system, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps "shorthand" in the context here is like New York Point, which is a shorthand braille. Wait, New York Point is a braille shorthand. So maybe Shorthand (candidate 8) could be considered a category that includes such systems. But the anti-examples include Morse and Semaphore, which are not for the blind, so shorthand (as a general concept) might be too broad, but if "Shorthand" refers to tactile systems for the blind, then maybe it's better. Hmm, but the examples include New York Point (a braille shorthand), so maybe Shorthand could be a 7? But the candidate is just "Shorthand", which is a broad term. So perhaps 3?

Alternatively, if the user considers that New York Point is a shorthand, then maybe "Shorthand" is part of the theme, so 7?

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try to re-express the theme again. The theme is tactile writing systems for the blind that are alternatives to standard Braille. So:

- Moon type is an alternative to Braille (so high score)

- Boston Line Type is an alternative (high)

- New York Point is a Braille shorthand (alternative)

So the theme is alternatives to Braille. Therefore:

Candidates that are alternatives to Braille would score high. So:

Unified English Braille (standard Braille) is the opposite, so low.

American Braille is same as standard Braille, so same.

Braille itself is standard, so low.

Finger spelling: no

SignWriting: no

Sign language: no

Shorthand: if it refers to systems like New York Point (a braille shorthand as an alternative), then maybe Shorthand could be considered part of the theme. But the term "Shorthand" is too broad. The examples are specific systems. So maybe "Shorthand" is a category, so 3?

Haptic communication: too broad, 2.

Hmmm, perhaps I need to think of each candidate as to whether they are tactile writing systems for the blind, but not standard Braille.

So:

1. Finger spelling: Not tactile writing, so 0.

2. Unified English Braille: standard Braille, so 0.

3. SignWriting: Not tactile, 0.

4. American Braille: same as Braille, 0.

5. Braille: 0.

6. Sign language: 0.

7. Haptic communication: Too broad, maybe 1.

8. Shorthand: If it's referring to a tactile shorthand like New York Point, but "Shorthand" in general is for sighted, so maybe 2.

Alternatively, perhaps "Shorthand" could be a system like New York Point, so if the candidate is "Shorthand", maybe 6?

Wait, New York Point is a type of shorthand for Braille, so if "Shorthand" here refers to that kind, then maybe it's a good fit. But the problem is the candidate is just "Shorthand" without qualification. Since the examples include New York Point (a Braille shorthand), perhaps "Shorthand" as a category could be considered, but the anti-examples include Morse, which is a code. So maybe "Shorthand" is a possible 7?

Alternatively, maybe the user considers that shorthand systems for the blind (like New York Point) are part of the theme, so "Shorthand" would be a 7, but if it's general shorthand (like Gregg) then 0. Since the question says "candidates" are terms, "Shorthand" alone is ambiguous. But given the examples include a shorthand variant, maybe it's a 7?

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to proceed with the initial analysis.

Final scores based on being tactile writing systems for the blind, alternatives to Braille:

1. Finger spelling: 0

2. Unified English Braille: 0 (since it's standard Braille)

Wait, but the theme's examples include alternatives to Braille. So the specific theme is "alternative tactile writing systems for the blind to Braille". So Braille itself is the broader theme, so the specific theme is the alternatives. Therefore:

- If a candidate is an alternative (like Moon type), then 10.

- If it's standard Braille (candidates 2,4,5), then 0.

- Haptic communication is a category, so maybe 2.

- Shorthand, if it's referring to a Braille shorthand like New York Point, then 7, else 0. Since the candidate is just "Shorthand", which can include many types, but the examples have a Braille shorthand, maybe 5?

Alternatively, since the examples include New York Point (a Braille shorthand), perhaps "Shorthand" in the context of tactile writing for the blind would be a good fit. So maybe 7?

Hmm, perhaps:

1. Finger spelling: 1 (since it's part of a communication system for the deaf, but not tactile writing for blind)

2. Unified English Braille: 0 (standard Braille)

3. SignWriting: 0

4. American Braille: 0

5. Braille: 0

6. Sign language: 0

7. Haptic communication: 2 (too broad but related)

8. Shorthand: 6 (if it includes Braille shorthand like the examples)

Alternatively, maybe Shorthand is 7 because the examples include a shorthand variant, so it's part of the theme.

Alternatively, the examples are all specific systems, so "Shorthand" as a category might not be specific enough. Maybe 4.

This is really tough. I think I need to make a decision based on the closest fit.

Let me try to assign scores step by step:

1. **Finger spelling**: Part of sign language, not tactile writing for blind. 0.

2. **Unified English Braille**: Standard Braille. The theme is alternatives to Braille, so 0.

3. **SignWriting**: For sign languages, not tactile. 0.

4. **American Braille**: Same as standard Braille. 0.

5. **Braille**: Standard system, so 0.

6. **Sign language**: Visual, 0.

7. **Haptic communication**: Broad term, but includes tactile systems. Since the examples are specific tactile systems, maybe 3.

8. **Shorthand**: If it refers to a tactile shorthand like New York Point (which is a shorthand for Braille), then maybe 7. But since "Shorthand" can also mean non-tactile, it's ambiguous. Maybe 5.

Alternatively, since the examples include a Braille shorthand (NY Point), "Shorthand" might be considered part of the theme. So 7.

Hmm, I'll go with 7 for Shorthand.

Wait, but the anti-examples include Morse code, which is a code. So the theme is not just any code, but specifically tactile writing for the blind. So Shorthand (if it's tactile and for the blind) would fit. Since NY Point is a Braille shorthand, "Shorthand" could be considered part of the theme, hence a 7.

Final scores:

1. 0

2. 0

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 3

8. 7

Wait, but Haptic communication might be a 2 or 3. Let's see:

Haptic communication is a broader category, so not specific to the examples, so maybe 2.

Shorthand: 7.

Yes.

So the final answers would be:

1:0

2:0

3:0

4:0

5:0

6:0

7:2

8:7

Wait, but maybe Haptic is 1?

Alternatively, perhaps Haptic includes Braille and alternatives, so it's part of the broader theme. Since the theme is the alternatives, Haptic would be too broad. So 1.

Shorthand as 7.

Okay, proceeding with that.
