Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The three examples are the Aztec animal sacrifices at pyramids, ancient Greek offerings at outdoor altars, and Vedic rituals with animal offerings in open-air ceremonies. So the common elements here seem to be:

1. Involvement of animal sacrifices or offerings to deities.
2. These rituals are performed in outdoor settings (pyramids, outdoor altars, open-air ceremonies).
3. They are part of a religious or spiritual practice.

Now, the anti-examples are Druidic tree worship, Celtic Samhain, and Native American rain dances. These don't involve animal sacrifices but might have other elements like nature worship or seasonal festivals. So the key is that the specific theme requires animal offerings in outdoor religious contexts.

Now, looking at each candidate:

1. **Wiccan solstice gathering**: Wicca often involves outdoor rituals, but I'm not sure if they use animal sacrifices. Modern Wicca tends to be more symbolic, maybe using cakes and wine instead. So maybe a 3 or 4? Lower because no animal sacrifice.

2. **Mayan ball game ritual**: The Mayans did have rituals, sometimes with sacrifices. The ball game might have been tied to such rituals, possibly involving human or animal sacrifices. But I'm not certain if the ball game itself is the ritual with offerings. Maybe a 6 or 7 if it's linked to sacrifices.

3. **Vodou ceremony with drumming and dancing**: Vodou does involve animal sacrifices in some ceremonies, but drumming and dancing are part of their rituals. However, not all Vodou ceremonies use animals. The mention here doesn't specify animal offerings, so maybe a 4 or 5?

4. **Hindu temple ceremony with flowers**: Hindu rituals often use flower offerings, but they are usually plant-based, not animal. Temples are indoor, so that's another minus. Probably a 1 or 2.

5. **Modern indoor church service**: Definitely indoor, and Christian services typically don't involve animal sacrifices now. Unless it's a very traditional one, but generally a 0 or 1.

6. **Jewish Passover Seder**: Passover involves symbolic foods but no animal sacrifices since the Temple was destroyed. So 0 or 1.

7. **Norse blóts with animal sacrifices outdoors**: Blót rituals in Norse religion did involve animal sacrifices outdoors. This seems like a perfect match. So a 9 or 10. Wait, the examples are Aztec, Greek, Vedic—all with animal offerings. Norse blót fits exactly. So maybe 10?

8. **Confucian ancestor worship**: Typically involves offerings like food, but not animal sacrifices. More about respect and rituals indoors. So 1 or 2.

Wait, but let me check each again carefully.

For candidate 2, the Mayan ball game: I think sometimes the losers of the ball game were sacrificed, but the ritual itself might be the game leading to that. So if the ball game is part of a ritual that includes sacrifices, then maybe it's a good match. So maybe 7?

Candidate 7: Norse outdoor animal sacrifices. That's exactly the theme. So 10.

Candidate 3: Vodou. If the ceremony does involve animal offerings, then it would be a match. But the question is, does the candidate mention animal offerings? The description says "involving drumming and dancing" but not animals. So without that, it's not a direct match. So maybe 3 or 4.

Candidate 1: Wiccan solstice. If they don't use animal sacrifice, then low. Maybe 2.

Candidate 4: Hindu with flowers. No animals, so 1.

Candidate 5: Indoor church, 0.

Candidate 6: Passover, 0.

Candidate 8: Confucian, 1.

So final scores would be:

1. 2

2. 7

3. 4

4. 1

5. 0

6. 0

7. 10

8. 1

Wait, but let me check again for Mayan. The Mayan ball game's connection to sacrifice: sometimes kings were sacrificed if they lost, but not sure if the game itself is the ritual with offerings. Maybe the ritual is more about the game leading to a sacrifice. So if the candidate is about the ball game ritual, and if that ritual includes animal (or human) sacrifice, then it's a good match. So maybe 7 is okay.

Vodou: If the ceremony is a specific one where animal offerings are made, but the description doesn't specify, so maybe a 3? Since it's possible but not certain. So maybe 3.

Wait, the user says anti-examples are Druidic, Samhain, rain dance. These are nature or seasonal without animal sacrifice. So the key is the animal offering in outdoor religious context.

Hindu temple with flowers: temple is indoor, so even if they use flowers, no animal, so low.

Confucian ancestor: offerings are food, not animal, and indoors? Probably. So 1.

So adjusting:

1. 2 (Wiccan: outdoor, but no animals)

2. 7 (Mayan: if the ritual includes animal sacrifice, maybe)

3. 3 (Vodou: possible but not specified, so lower)

4. 1 (flowers, no animal)

5. 0

6. 0

7. 10 (Norse: exact match)

8. 1 (Confucian)

That seems better. Maybe that's the way to go.
