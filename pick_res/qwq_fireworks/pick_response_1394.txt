Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the examples given: animal horn, gourd, and hollowed-out bamboo. Then, I have to consider the anti-examples: glass bottle, plastic jug, and glass jar. The key here is to identify what exactly unites the examples and excludes the anti-examples.

Looking at the examples: animal horn is a natural material, part of an animal. A gourd is a plant that's dried and hollowed out, and hollowed-out bamboo is another natural plant material. All three are natural, organic materials that have been hollowed or used in their natural form for holding things. The anti-examples, on the other hand, are all man-made materials (glass, plastic) and perhaps more refined or industrial products. So maybe the theme is natural, organic containers that are either hollowed or used in their natural state.

Now, let's look at each candidate:

1. Metal can: Metal is man-made, not natural. So probably a low score, maybe 2 or 3? But wait, metal cans are containers. However, since the examples are natural, this would be more like the anti-examples. Maybe a 1 or 2?

2. Steel flask: Similar to metal can. Steel is man-made. So maybe similar to 1. Perhaps a 2?

3. Porcelain teapot: Porcelain is a ceramic, which is man-made. The examples are natural materials. So this is a manufactured item, so probably a low score, maybe 1 or 2. But porcelain is fired clay, which is a natural material processed. Hmm, maybe a bit higher? Maybe 3?

4. Coconut shell: Coconut is a natural product, often used as a bowl or container. Since it's a natural, hollowed-out item, this fits the examples. So maybe a 9 or 10? Wait, but is it hollowed out naturally or by humans? If you use a coconut shell as a container, you might need to remove the flesh and maybe hollow it, similar to a gourd. So maybe 8 or 9.

5. Ceramic bowl: Ceramic is man-made from clay. Even though clay is natural, the process of making ceramic is industrial. So similar to porcelain, but maybe lower. Like 2?

6. Plastic tub: Plastic is definitely an anti-example material. So 0?

7. Paper cup: Paper is a processed material, but from natural sources. However, the anti-examples include plastic, which is synthetic. Paper is more natural but processed. Maybe a 4? Or is it too processed? Since the examples are natural and not processed (like bamboo is hollowed but not as much as paper?), maybe 3?

8. Ceramic vase: Same as porcelain, so maybe 2?

Wait, let me reassess. The examples are all natural materials used as containers, possibly without heavy processing. So coconut shell would be a strong match (maybe 9). Porcelain and ceramic are processed, so lower. Metal and plastic are definitely out. 

Wait the anti-examples include glass bottle and glass jar. Glass is a man-made material, so the theme excludes man-made materials. So the key is natural materials that are either naturally hollow or minimally processed (like hollowed bamboo or gourds). 

So:

1. Metal can: 0 (man-made, like anti-examples)
2. Steel flask: 0 or 1? Maybe 1 because it's a container but material is definitely excluded.
3. Porcelain teapot: 1 (processed ceramic)
4. Coconut shell: 10? Wait, but is coconut shell considered "hollowed-out"? If you use it as a container, you have to hollow it, similar to a gourd. So yes, that's exactly like the examples. So maybe 10. But wait, the examples are animal horn (natural), gourd (hollowed), bamboo (hollowed). Coconut is a fruit, so when you hollow it, it's similar. So 10? But maybe 9 to leave room for possible differences. Hmm. Maybe 9.

Wait, the examples include animal horn which is a natural horn, so maybe the coconut shell is as natural as that. So 10? But let me check the anti-examples again. The anti-examples are glass and plastic, which are synthetic. So coconut is natural, so it should be a 10. Wait, but maybe the user considers that coconut is more like a fruit and the examples are parts of animals and plants (gourd and bamboo). But coconut is a plant product. So maybe yes. 

Wait, but the anti-examples include glass jar. The user says the anti-examples can follow a broader theme. The specific theme is the exact one. So if coconut is part of the specific theme, then it should be 10. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "containers made from naturally hollow or easily hollowed organic materials without synthetic processing". Then coconut is perfect. So 10. 

But maybe the user thinks that coconut is not hollowed out by humans? Like, the shell is the outer part, but to use it as a container, you have to remove the inside. So similar to the gourd. So yes, so 10. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the examples are all "natural horns or plant parts used as containers without much modification". Coconut is similar. 

Wait, the examples include "hollowed-out bamboo" which requires some work. So coconut would be similar. So 10. 

But maybe the user wants to exclude something? Let me see the candidates again. The other candidates: porcelain teapot is man-made, so definitely lower. 

So proceeding:

1. Metal can: 0 (since it's metal, which is synthetic like the anti-examples)
2. Steel flask: 0 (same as above)
3. Porcelain teapot: 1 (processed ceramic)
4. Coconut shell: 10 (natural, hollowed or used as is)
5. Ceramic bowl: 1 (processed)
6. Plastic tub: 0 (anti-example material)
7. Paper cup: Maybe 3? Since paper is processed from natural material, but more processed than coconut. Not as natural as the examples. 
8. Ceramic vase: 1 (same as porcelain)

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be graded and not polarized. So maybe some in between. Let me think again. 

Wait, the anti-examples include glass and plastic, which are synthetic. So the key is natural materials. So:

Metal can: 0 (synthetic)
Steel flask: 0 (synthetic)
Porcelain is ceramic, which is from clay, a natural material but processed. So maybe 2? Because it's made from natural but heavily processed. 

Coconut shell: 10.

Ceramic bowl: 2.

Plastic tub: 0.

Paper cup: Paper is made from wood pulp, so natural but processed. Maybe 3. Since paper is more processed than coconut but less than ceramic? 

Porcelain and ceramic are higher processing, so lower scores.

Steel and metal: 0.

So:

1. Metal can: 0
2. Steel flask: 0
3. Porcelain teapot: 2
4. Coconut shell: 10
5. Ceramic bowl: 2
6. Plastic tub: 0
7. Paper cup: 3
8. Ceramic vase: 2

Wait, but the user wants the scores to be granular, so maybe some differences between porcelain, ceramic, etc. Porcelain and ceramic are similar, so same scores. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is not just natural materials, but also that they are containers made from parts that are naturally hollow or can be hollowed with minimal work. So coconut is a good fit, 10. 

Paper cup is processed, so 3. 

But let me check another angle. The examples are all things that can be naturally occurring or minimally altered. Animal horn is naturally a horn, maybe used as is. Gourd is dried and hollowed. Bamboo is hollowed. 

So, the key is natural material, and either naturally hollow or can be easily hollowed. 

So for each candidate:

Metal can: Not natural, 0.

Steel flask: Same, 0.

Porcelain teapot: man-made, so 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

Ceramic bowl: same, 1.

Coconut shell: 10.

Paper cup: processed paper, maybe 3.

Plastic tub: 0.

Ceramic vase: 1.

Wait, but why paper cup is 3? Maybe it's made from a natural material but heavily processed. Since the examples are minimally processed, so maybe 3 is better than 0 but not great. 

Alternatively, maybe paper is considered more natural than plastic or metal. But compared to the examples, it's still more processed. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "containers made from natural materials that are either naturally hollow or can be hollowed with minimal processing". So coconut is perfect (10). 

Porcelain and ceramic are made from clay but processed a lot, so low. 

Paper is processed but from natural, but maybe the form isn't hollowed but molded, so maybe lower. 

Hmm, perhaps:

1. Metal can: 0

2. Steel flask: 0

3. Porcelain teapot: 1

4. Coconut shell: 10

5. Ceramic bowl: 1

6. Plastic tub: 0

7. Paper cup: 3 (since paper is natural but processed into a form that's not hollowed but formed, so less like examples)

8. Ceramic vase: 1

Alternatively, maybe the ceramic items are 2 instead of 1? To have more granularity.

Alternatively, maybe the porcelain teapot is 2, ceramic bowl 2, etc. 

Alternatively, maybe the paper cup is 4, because it's a container made from a natural material but not hollowed. The examples are all hollowed or naturally hollow, so paper is a container but not hollowed. So maybe lower.

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to see the differences between the examples and anti-examples again.

Examples: animal horn (naturally hollow?), gourd (hollowed), bamboo (hollowed). 

Wait, animal horn is not naturally hollow. Wait, horns are solid, right? Wait, maybe the user made a mistake? Or perhaps the horn is used as a container by hollowing it? Maybe I assumed wrong. Wait, let me confirm: animal horns are actually solid. So to use as a container, you have to hollow them out. So maybe all three examples are items that are hollowed by humans from natural materials. 

Therefore, the key is that they are natural materials that have been hollowed out (or modified) to create a container. 

So the criteria are:

- Made from natural material (plant or animal)

- The container is created by hollowing or modifying the natural material (e.g., cutting, shaping, hollowing)

Therefore, coconut shell would be similar to gourd and bamboo: you take the natural material and hollow it (or use the natural hollow part). 

Porcelain is clay that's been shaped and fired, which is a different process. So not just hollowing but forming. 

Paper cup is formed from processed paper, not hollowed from a natural material. 

So:

Metal can: no, 0

Steel flask: no, 0

Porcelain: no, 1

Ceramic: same, 1

Coconut: yes, 10

Paper cup: 0? Or maybe 2? Because it's paper (natural), but not hollowed. The process is different. So maybe 2 is better than 0 but worse than 10. 

Wait, maybe the key is that the material itself is the container. Like, the coconut shell is the container, whereas paper is formed into a new shape. So coconut is better. 

So:

Paper cup: made from processed paper into a new form, so 2.

Plastic tub: 0.

Ceramic vase: 1.

So final scores:

1. 0

2. 0

3. 1

4.10

5.1

6.0

7.2

8.1

Alternatively, maybe paper is 3. 

Alternatively, maybe porcelain is 2, ceramic bowl 2, to have more gradation. 

Alternatively, porcelain is 2 because it's a more refined material. 

Hmm, I think I'll go with:

1.0

2.0

3.1

4.10

5.1

6.0

7.3

8.1

Because paper is a natural material but processed into a different form, so a bit better than 0 but not great. 

Wait, but why 3 for paper? Maybe 2 is better. Let me think again. Since the examples are all natural materials that are hollowed or used in their natural form as containers. The paper cup is a container made from a natural material (paper) but it's not hollowed from the source material (tree) but processed into a new form. So maybe it's a 3 because it's still natural but not meeting the hollowing aspect. 

Alternatively, maybe 2. 

Alternatively, maybe the score for paper is 2, porcelain 1, ceramic 1, etc. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ceramic items are 2 because they are made from natural clay but processed. 

Hmm. Let me try to assign scores with more steps. Let's see:

Coconut is a perfect match (10). 

Items made from natural materials but with significant processing: ceramic (clay fired), porcelain (similar), these are 2. 

Paper is made from wood but processed into pulp and formed into a cup, which is more processing than coconut, so maybe 3? 

Wait, but paper is more processed than clay? Maybe not. Clay is raw earth, whereas paper is from wood. So maybe paper is more processed. 

Alternatively, maybe paper is 3 because it's a step closer than plastic but not as much as ceramic. 

Alternatively, maybe the scores are:

0 for metal, steel, plastic.

For ceramic, porcelain: 1 each.

Coconut 10.

Paper: 3.

Vase and teapot are ceramics, so 1 each.

So the final scores would be:

<number>1</number><score>0</score>

<number>2</number><score>0</score>

<number>3</number><score>1</score>

<number>4</number><score>10</score>

<number>5</number><score>1</score>

<number>6</number><score>0</score>

<number>7</number><score>3</score>

<number>8</number><score>1</score>

This uses the full range from 0 to 10. The paper cup gets a 3 because it's natural but processed, but not as much as the ceramics. The coconut is the best match. The rest are either synthetic (0) or natural but heavily processed (1-3).
