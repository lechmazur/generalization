Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples provided are Hopi yucca fiber sandals, Navajo wool blanket, and Cherokee river cane blowgun. 

Looking at these, they all seem to be traditional crafts made by Indigenous peoples. Let me break them down more precisely. The Hopi, Navajo, and Cherokee are all Native American tribes. The materials used are natural fibers or materials (yucca, wool, river cane). The items are functional or traditional crafts specific to their culture. 

Now, the anti-examples are Inuit soapstone carving, Bamboo fan from China, and African wooden mask. The Inuit are also Indigenous, but soapstone carvings might be more sculptural or decorative rather than functional. The bamboo fan is from China, which is a different region, and the African mask is another cultural artifact but perhaps not from the same Indigenous groups as the examples. The key here is that the anti-examples might be too broad (like just being Indigenous art) but not matching the specific theme. 

So the specific theme might be: traditional functional crafts made by Indigenous peoples of the Americas using natural, locally sourced materials. The anti-examples include non-American Indigenous groups (like Inuit maybe? Wait, Inuit are from the Arctic, which is part of the Americas, so maybe that's why it's an anti-example. Hmm, maybe the theme is more specific to certain regions or types of items. Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the examples are all from Native American tribes, and the anti-examples include other regions (China, Africa) but also maybe different material uses? The Inuit carving is soapstone, which is a different material than the fibers and natural materials in the examples. 

Alternatively, maybe the specific theme is that they are all items made from plant-based materials by specific Native American tribes for practical or cultural uses. The anti-examples include non-plant materials (soapstone, wood for masks, bamboo is a grass but the fan might be more decorative). Let me check each example again:

- Hopi: yucca fiber (plant) sandals (functional)
- Navajo: wool (animal, but from sheep, which are domesticated) blanket (functional)
- Cherokee: river cane (plant) blowgun (functional, but also a tool)

Wait, the Navajo uses wool, which is animal, so maybe plant-based isn't the key. Alternatively, the materials are all natural, non-industrial. The key might be that they are all traditional crafts of specific Native American tribes, each named (Hopi, Navajo, Cherokee), so the theme is "traditional crafts made by specific Native American tribes using traditional materials and techniques."

The anti-examples are Inuit (which are Indigenous but from a different region, though technically part of the Americas), Chinese bamboo fan (non-Native American), African mask (non-American Indigenous). So the theme is specifically Native American tribes, with the crafts being traditional and functional or culturally significant.

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Peruvian alpaca scarf: Peru is in the Americas, and alpaca is a traditional material. But is Peruvian considered part of the same grouping as Hopi, Navajo, Cherokee? Those are all from North America, while Peru is South American. The theme might be specifically North American tribes, so this might be a lower score. But maybe the theme is broader to all Native American (including South). Not sure yet.

2. Haida cedar bark basket: Haida are a Native American/First Nations group in the Pacific Northwest. Cedar bark is traditional material. This seems to fit perfectly.

3. Indonesian batik cloth: Indonesia is outside the Americas, so definitely an anti-example.

4. Australian aboriginal dot painting: Australia's Indigenous, not American. So anti-example.

5. Mexican clay pottery: Mexico is in the Americas. Clay is traditional material. But does it fit the specific theme? The examples are sandals, blanket, blowgun. Pottery is a traditional craft, so maybe yes. But need to see if Mexican is considered in the theme. The original examples are all from tribes in what's now the US, but Mexican tribes would also be Native American.

6. Celtic woven tapestry: Celtic is European (Ireland, Scotland), so non-American. So anti-example.

7. Vietnamese silk embroidery: Vietnam, so Asia. Definitely anti.

8. Maori jade pendant: Maori are from New Zealand (Pacific Islands), so again non-American.

So now scoring:

Looking again at the anti-examples, Inuit are technically from the Arctic (North America), but their example is an anti-example. Maybe the theme is specifically tribes from the continental US? Or perhaps the key is that the examples are all from specific named tribes (Hopi, Navajo, Cherokee) and the crafts are utilitarian or traditional tools (sandals, blanket, blowgun). The Inuit carving might be more decorative, hence anti-example.

So for candidate 1, Peruvian alpaca scarf: if the theme is Native American (including South), then it's a good fit. But maybe the original examples are all North American tribes. Peru is South America, so maybe a 5? Or lower.

Candidate 2: Haida is definitely a North American tribe, so 10.

Candidate 3: Indonesia, 0.

Candidate 4: Australia, 0.

Candidate 5: Mexican clay pottery. Mexico is part of the Americas. If the theme includes all Native American, then 8? Maybe 7?

Candidate 6: Celtic, 0.

Candidate 7: Vietnam, 0.

Candidate 8: Maori, 0.

Wait but need to check the exact theme. The original examples are all specific tribes with specific items made from natural materials, functional or traditional. The anti-example Inuit soapstone is from a Native group but maybe their item is considered more decorative, so the theme might prioritize functional items. The Haida basket is functional. The Cherokee blowgun is a tool. The Navajo blanket is functional. So maybe functional items are part of the theme.

Peruvian alpaca scarf: functional (warmth) so that's okay. But is Peruvian considered? If the theme is specifically North American tribes, then Peru is South, so lower. But if it's all Native American, then higher. Since the examples are all from the US, maybe the theme is US-based tribes. Then Peru would be a 3 or 4.

Mexican pottery: if Mexico is included as part of the Americas, then maybe 6 or 7.

Haida: 10.

Now, the anti-examples include Inuit (Arctic, which is part of North America but maybe excluded because their example is an anti-example). So perhaps the specific theme is tribes from the continental US. That would make Inuit soapstone an anti-example because it's from a different region even within the Americas. So then:

1. Peru (South America): 2.

2. Haida (North America, US/Canada border region): 10.

3. Indonesia: 0.

4. Australia:0.

5. Mexico: maybe 5? Since it's part of the Americas but not the US.

6. Celtic:0.

7. Vietnam:0.

8. Maori:0.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are all from tribes with names that are specific and well-known in the US, so the theme is "traditional crafts of specific Native American tribes from the contiguous US or recognized as part of the US history." Then Haida is on the edge (Canada/US border), but still considered. Mexican might be a 4 or 5.

Alternatively, the theme could be that each example is a specific tribe's traditional craft made from a natural material indigenous to their region. The Inuit carving uses soapstone which is a stone, not plant or animal fiber like the examples. The anti-examples include materials not matching (stone, wood for mask, bamboo). So perhaps the materials are plant or animal fibers/textiles. Let's check:

Hopi: yucca fiber (plant fiber)

Navajo: wool (animal fiber)

Cherokee: river cane (plant)

So materials are fibers (plant or animal) or plant-based. The anti-examples include soapstone (stone), bamboo (plant, but the fan is maybe more decorative?), and wooden mask (wood). So maybe the theme is crafts made from plant or animal fibers, not stone or wood. 

If that's the case, then:

Peruvian alpaca scarf: alpaca is animal fiber, so that's a 10? But the original examples include both plant and animal fibers, so that's okay. So Peru would be 10? Wait but why is the Inuit soapstone an anti-example? Because it's stone, not fiber. The African mask is wood, so also not fiber. The Chinese bamboo fan is bamboo (plant), but maybe the theme requires the fiber to be from a specific tribe's traditional material. Hmm, but the Cherokee used river cane (plant), so bamboo could fit, but it's from China. So maybe the region (Native American) is key.

Putting this together, the specific theme is: traditional crafts made by specific Native American tribes using fibers (plant or animal) from their region. 

Thus:

1. Peruvian alpaca scarf: alpaca fiber (animal), Native American (South). If region is only North, then lower. If includes all Americas, then 8 or 9? But since the examples are all North, maybe 6.

2. Haida cedar bark basket: plant fiber (cedar bark), North American. 10.

3. Indonesian batik: cotton or plant, but non-Native American. 0.

4. Aboriginal: non-American. 0.

5. Mexican clay pottery: clay isn't a fiber. So even if Mexican, the material is different. So lower. Maybe 3.

6. Celtic: non-American. 0.

7. Vietnamese silk: silk is animal (silkworm), but Vietnam. 0.

8. Maori jade: stone, non-American. 0.

Wait, but the Navajo used wool, which is animal fiber, so animal fibers are allowed. So Peruvian alpaca is okay. But Mexican clay is not fiber, so that's out. So:

1. Peru: 8 or 9? Because it's a fiber (alpaca) from a Native American group (though South American). Since the original examples are North, maybe a 6 or 7.

Haida is 10.

Mexican pottery: 2 (since clay is not fiber, but maybe functional? But material is key here).

Wait, maybe the material is a key part. So the theme requires fibers (plant or animal) so materials like clay or stone disqualify. Thus:

Candidate 5 (clay) would be 0, but since it's Mexican, maybe 1? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, if the material is a strict requirement, then:

1. Peru: 10? If region is okay.

But the anti-example includes Inuit soapstone (stone), which is a material issue. So if the region is Native American (including South), then Peru's scarf is 10. But original examples are all North. So perhaps the region is North America. Then Peru would be 3.

Haida is North, so 10.

Mexican: if it's in North, but clay is non-fiber, so 0 or 1.

Alternatively, maybe the region is not the key, but the tribe being a specific named group with traditional craft using fibers. So even if the tribe is in South America, as long as they use fiber, it's okay. Then Peru's scarf would be a good match (8-10?), but lower than Haida which is a direct example's region.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to assign scores based on the strictest possible interpretation where the theme is: traditional crafts made by specific Native American (North American) tribes using fibers (plant or animal) from their region.

Thus:

1. Peru: South American, so 3 (material is good but region is not North).

2. Haida: 10.

3. Indonesia:0.

4. Australia:0.

5. Mexico: if considered North (since Mexico is part of North America geographically), then 5? But material is clay (non-fiber). So 0.

Wait Mexico is part of North America. So if the region is North America, then:

1. Peru (South America): 2.

5. Mexico (North America, but clay): material disqualifies, so 1.

Haida:10.

6. Celtic:0.

7. Vietnam:0.

8. Maori:0.

But maybe the material is a key factor. The examples include both plant and animal fibers, so any fiber is okay. So:

Candidate 5 (clay) is non-fiber, so 0.

Candidate 1 (alpaca fiber, South America) is 6 (since region is a bit off but material is good).

Haida is 10.

Mexican:0.

Others are 0.

So the scores would be:

1. Peruvian alpaca scarf: 6 or 7? Maybe 7 because it's a fiber, just different region.

Wait, maybe the region is not strictly North, but any Native American. Since the examples are all from the US, but the theme might be broader to all indigenous peoples of the Americas. In that case, Peru is acceptable, so 8-9. But the anti-example Inuit is from the Arctic (North America) but their example is anti, so maybe the theme excludes Inuit? That complicates it. Alternatively, the Inuit example is an anti-example because it's a carving (stone) not a fiber. So maybe material is the key, not region. 

If material (fiber) and tribal specificity are the key, then:

1. Peru: fiber (alpaca) from a specific tribe (Peruvian, like Quechua?), so 9.

2. Haida:10.

3. Indonesia:0 (non-Native American).

4. Australia:0.

5. Mexico: clay, so 0.

6. Celtic:0.

7. Vietnam:0.

8. Maori:0.

But why is Inuit soapstone an anti-example? Because it's stone, not fiber. So yes, material is key. Then the theme is "traditional crafts made by specific Indigenous tribes using fibers (plant or animal) from their region."

Thus, the scores would be:

1. Peru: 9 (fiber, specific tribe).

2. Haida:10.

3. Indonesia:0 (non-Native American, but the material is plant (bamboo). Wait, bamboo is a plant fiber? The fan is made from bamboo, which is a grass, so maybe it's a fiber. But the anti-example is bamboo fan from China. Since China is non-Native American, it's excluded. So Indonesia's batik cloth is cotton? Or batik uses fabric, which is plant-based (cotton). But the anti-example includes it because it's non-Native American. So the key is region (Native American tribes) plus fiber material.

So for the candidates:

Indonesian batik: non-Native American, so 0.

Haida is 10.

Peruvian: 9 (assuming the tribe is specific and in the Americas).

Mexican clay:0 (material is clay).

Vietnamese silk: silk is animal (silkworm), but non-Native American, so 0.

Maori jade: stone, non-Native American, so 0.

Celtic:0.

Australian:0.

So the scores would be:

1. Peruvian: 9.

2. Haida:10.

3.0.

4.0.

5.0.

6.0.

7.0.

8.0.

But wait the anti-examples include African mask (wood) and Inuit carving (stone). So the Inuit example is an anti-example because material is stone, not fiber. So the material must be fiber. 

Wait the Cherokee blowgun uses river cane (plant fiber?), so yes. So the Haida basket is cedar bark (plant fiber). So the material must be fiber. 

Vietnamese silk embroidery: silk is a fiber (from silkworms), but non-Native American. So it's 0.

Maori jade pendant: stone, so 0.

Mexican clay pottery: clay is non-fiber, so 0.

So the scores:

1. Peru:9 (fiber, Native American).

2. Haida:10.

3.0.

4.0.

5.0.

6.0.

7.0.

8.0.

But the user said to use the full range 0-10, not just 0,9,10. Maybe some candidates have partial matches.

Looking again at the candidates:

Candidate 4: Australian aboriginal dot painting. Non-Native American, so 0.

Candidate 5: Mexican clay. Not fiber, so 0.

Candidate 6: Celtic. 0.

Candidate7: Vietnamese silk (fiber but non-Native). 0.

Candidate8: Maori jade (non-fiber and non-Native). 0.

Candidate3: Indonesian batik (non-Native). 0.

Candidate1: Peru. Maybe 8 instead of 9? To have a range.

Alternatively, maybe some have low scores. For example, the Mexican pottery might have a 1 because it's from the Americas but wrong material.

Wait the original examples are all functional items (sandals, blanket, blowgun). The Peruvian scarf is functional (clothing), so that's okay. The Haida basket is functional. The Mexican pottery is also functional, but material is clay. So maybe 2 for material mismatch but functional and region okay?

If the theme is functional items made from fibers, then:

Mexican: clay, so 0.

Alternatively, if the key is the tribe's specific traditional craft regardless of material, then maybe Mexico's pottery is a 5, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the key is the combination of tribe specificity (named tribes), material (fiber), and region (Native American). So Peru's alpaca scarf is a good match (9), Haida 10. The others are 0 except maybe some others.

Wait the user mentioned that anti-examples can follow a broader theme. For instance, the Inuit carving is a sculpture, which might be a broader category of Indigenous art, but the specific theme is fiber-based crafts. So the broader theme is Indigenous crafts, but the specific is fiber-based.

So candidates that are from Native American tribes but use non-fiber materials would get lower scores.

Mexican clay: if the tribe is specific (like Aztec or Maya), but material is clay, then maybe 3? Since it's Native American but material mismatch.

Peru's alpaca scarf is 9, Haida 10.

Others:

Australian:0

Indonesian:0

Celtic:0

Vietnamese:0

Maori:0

So for the candidates:

1. Peru:9

2. Haida:10

3.0

4.0

5.3 (if considering region but material mismatch)

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user said to use the full range. Maybe some others can have low scores.

Alternatively, the Mexican pottery could be a 2, Vietnamese silk embroidery is 1 (since it's fiber but not Native American), etc. But I need to assign each candidate a score from 0-10, using all numbers.

Let me try again with more granularity:

1. Peruvian alpaca scarf: matches on fiber (alpaca is animal fiber), and is a Native American tribe (Peru's indigenous groups). The only difference is the region (South America vs. North in examples). Since the examples are all from North, this might be a 7 or 8. Let's say 8.

2. Haida cedar basket: perfect match, 10.

3. Indonesian batik: non-Native, 0.

4. Australian dot painting: non-Native, 0.

5. Mexican clay: Native American (Mexico is part of North America), but material is clay (non-fiber). So maybe 3 (for region but material mismatch).

6. Celtic:0.

7. Vietnamese silk: non-Native, but uses silk (fiber). Maybe 1 (material matches but region wrong).

8. Maori jade: non-Native and non-fiber, 0.

This way, scores use 0,1,3,8,10.

Alternatively, for candidate 7: Vietnamese uses silk (fiber) but non-Native, so 2.

Candidate 5: Mexican clay: 2.

Candidate1: 7.

Candidate2:10.

Others 0,1, etc.

Alternatively, maybe the Maori pendant is made from jade (stone), so 0.

So the scores would be:

1.8

2.10

3.0

4.0

5.2

6.0

7.1

8.0

But the user wants each on a line with numbers 1-8. Let me structure it as per instructions.
