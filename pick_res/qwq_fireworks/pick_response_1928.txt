Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are green jade prayer beads, red ochre powder bowl, and white sage smudge bundle. Hmm, all of these are natural materials used in some kind of ritual or spiritual practice. The materials are all organic or earthy: jade, ochre, sage. They’re not metals. The anti-examples are brass bell, bronze ritual vessel, metal singing bowl—so metals are out. The theme seems to be items made from natural, non-metal materials used in rituals or spiritual ceremonies.

Now looking at the candidates. 

1. Steel ritual sword: Steel is a metal. The anti-examples include brass and bronze, so metal items are excluded. So this should be a 0. Wait, but it's a ritual sword. But since the material is metal, it's an anti-example. So 0.

2. Gold offering plate: Gold is a metal. Again, same as anti-examples. So 0.

3. Silver chalice: Silver is metal. 0 again.

4. Wooden cross: Wood is natural. A cross could be a religious symbol. So maybe this is a good candidate. The examples use materials like jade, ochre, sage—natural. Wooden cross fits. But is the theme specifically about ritual items? The cross could be for prayer or religious use. Maybe a 7 or 8? Wait, but the examples are prayer beads, a bowl for powder, and a smudge bundle. These are all items used in specific rituals, maybe more related to earth-based or natural practices. A wooden cross might be more general religious, but still, material is natural. Maybe 6 or 7?

5. Clay ritual pot: Clay is natural. The example has a bowl made of red ochre powder, which is a clay-like material. So this fits well. Maybe 9 or 10. Wait, the original examples have specific colors (green, red, white). The clay pot is just clay, but the theme might not require color. The main thing is the material and ritual use. So 9?

6. Copper meditation bowl: Copper is a metal. The anti-examples include metal bowls. So this would be 0. Wait, but the example has a meditation bowl? No, the examples include a smudge bundle, prayer beads, and a powder bowl. The anti-examples have metal singing bowls, which are similar to meditation bowls. So copper is metal, so 0.

7. Black obsidian ceremonial knife: Obsidian is a natural volcanic glass. It's not metal. Ceremonial use. The material is natural. The first example has jade, which is a stone. Obsidian is similar. So maybe a 9 or 10. But the examples are prayer beads, a bowl for powder, and a smudge bundle. The knife is a tool, which might be different. But still ceremonial and natural material. Maybe 8?

8. Ceramic incense holder: Ceramic is a fired clay, so natural material. Incense is part of rituals. The example has a powder bowl, so maybe this is similar. Ceramic is like clay. The anti-examples don't include ceramics. So maybe 7 or 8. Since ceramic is a processed material but still from earth, perhaps 8?

Wait, let me reassess. The original examples are all natural materials in their raw or minimally processed forms: jade (stone), ochre (mineral powder), sage (plant). The anti-examples are all metal. The candidates: 

Wooden cross (natural material, but maybe not as processed as the examples?), clay pot (raw material), obsidian knife (natural stone), ceramic is processed. Maybe ceramic is a bit more processed than clay, but still okay. 

Clay ritual pot: 10? Since it's raw material and ritual use. 

Black obsidian ceremonial knife: obsidian is natural, so maybe 9. 

Wooden cross: 7 because cross is a common religious symbol, but the material is wood which is natural. 

Ceramic incense holder: 8? 

Wait, but the original examples include a bowl (red ochre powder bowl) which is a container, prayer beads, and a smudge bundle. The ceramic incense holder is a container, so that's a good match. 

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust. Let me list all the candidates again with scores:

1. Steel ritual sword – metal, so 0
2. Gold offering plate – metal, 0
3. Silver chalice – metal, 0
4. Wooden cross – natural material, used in rituals, so maybe 7
5. Clay ritual pot – matches perfectly, 10
6. Copper meditation bowl – metal, 0
7. Black obsidian ceremonial knife – natural, ceremonial, 9
8. Ceramic incense holder – natural material, ritual use, 8

Wait, but maybe the cross is more of a symbol than a ritual tool. The examples are tools or containers for specific rituals. The cross might be more of a symbol than a functional ritual item. So maybe lower. Maybe 5 or 6? 

Alternatively, the wooden cross could be used in rituals, so 7 is okay. 

Clay pot is exactly like the ochre bowl, so 10. 

Obsidian knife: the examples don't have knives, but it's a ceremonial tool made from natural material, so 8 or 9. Maybe 9. 

Ceramic incense holder: similar to the bowl, so 8. 

Alright, let me assign scores accordingly.
