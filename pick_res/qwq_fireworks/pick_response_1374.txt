Okay, let's see. The user has given me three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to figure out the specific theme that distinguishes them. The examples are Lion of Babylon, Great Sphinx of Giza, and Colossal Olmec Head 1. The anti-examples are Egyptian obelisks, Stonehenge trilithons, and Assyrian lamassu.

First, I need to find what's common among the examples. The Lion of Babylon is a large statue, the Sphinx is a monumental sculpture with a human head and lion body, and the Olmec heads are massive stone heads. All of these are colossal sculptures, probably ancient, and likely depicting rulers or deities. They're all massive in size and serve a symbolic or religious purpose.

Now the anti-examples: Egyptian obelisks are tall, four-sided pillars, often with pyramidion tops. They're monumental but not necessarily depicting figures. Stonehenge trilithons are the structures made of two vertical stones and a horizontal one, part of the monument but not a single sculpted figure. Assyrian lamassu are protective deities depicted as winged bulls with human heads, similar to the Sphinx, but since they're listed as anti-examples, maybe the key difference is that lamassu are part of a broader category but perhaps not standalone colossal heads or specific to a different culture or style?

Wait, the examples include the Olmec heads, which are just heads, while the Sphinx is a body with a head, and the Lion of Babylon is a lion (maybe a full body). The anti-examples include lamassu which are also composite figures but maybe the theme is specifically colossal heads or colossal figures from ancient civilizations that are representations of rulers or important figures, but not necessarily part of a larger structure or not of a certain type.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is colossal stone heads or statues from ancient civilizations that are anthropomorphic or zoomorphic, but not obelisks, trilithons, or lamassu. The lamassu are similar to the sphinx but perhaps the key is that the examples are singular, monumental pieces, while the anti-examples are part of architectural structures. For example, the lamassu were often at gateways, part of buildings, whereas the sphinx is a standalone monument. The Olmec heads are individual heads, the Lion of Babylon is a statue, etc.

Looking at the candidates now:

1. Terracotta Warriors: These are a collection of statues, not a single colossal figure. They are part of a larger army, so maybe not as singular. So maybe lower score.

2. Persepolis reliefs: These are carvings on walls, not freestanding sculptures. So probably anti-example because they are part of a structure, like the lamassu and trilithons.

3. Khmer Buddha statues: These can be large, but Buddha statues might be more religious than the examples which might be more about rulers. Not sure. The Olmec heads are thought to be rulers, so maybe Buddha statues are different in purpose.

4. Parthenon frieze: Again, part of a building, so similar to Persepolis reliefs, which are anti-examples. So lower score.

5. Moai at Rano Raraku: These are the Easter Island statues, which are large stone heads (or full bodies, but some are just heads). They are singular, monumental, so this might be a good match. Higher score.

6. Trajan's Column: A column with reliefs, so like an obelisk, which is an anti-example. So probably low score.

7. Aztec Sun Stone: That's the calendar stone, a disc, not a statue or colossal head. So maybe lower.

8. Mayan stone reliefs: Again, part of structures, like walls or temples, so similar to Persepolis and Parthenon, so lower.

Wait, but the examples include the Colossal Olmec Head, which is a head. The Moai are similar in being large stone figures, often with large heads. The Sphinx is a body with a head, but still a single monumental statue. The Lion of Babylon is a lion statue, possibly full body. So maybe the theme is large, ancient, monumental sculptures (statues) that are either heads or full figures, not part of a larger structure, and perhaps associated with rulers or deities. 

So the anti-examples are things like obelisks (columns), trilithons (parts of Stonehenge), and lamassu (which are protective figures but part of architectural structures like gateways). So the key is standalone colossal statues, not part of buildings. 

So for the candidates:

1. Terracotta Warriors: Many statues, not a single colossal one. So maybe 3.

2. Persepolis reliefs: Part of a building, so 0 or 1.

3. Khmer Buddha statues: Some are large, standalone. Angkor Wat has large statues, but if they are part of temples, maybe lower. Maybe 4?

Wait, some Khmer Buddhas are standalone, like the Bayon temple's faces. But the question is whether they are part of a structure or standalone. The examples are standalone. So maybe 5 or 6.

4. Parthenon frieze: Part of the temple, so 1.

5. Moai: Standalone, monumental, so 9 or 10?

6. Trajan's Column: Column with reliefs, so 0 or 1.

7. Aztec Sun Stone: A disk, not a statue, so 2.

8. Mayan stone reliefs: Part of structures, so 1.

Wait, but maybe the Mayan reliefs are standalone? Not sure. The examples include the Olmec heads which are part of the Olmec civilization, so maybe Mayan reliefs are part of buildings, so lower.

Moai are definitely standalone and monumental, so maybe 9 or 10. The Olmec heads are heads, but the Moai are full figures (though some are just heads). The Lion of Babylon is a lion statue. The Sphinx is a lion with a human head. So the theme might be colossal stone sculptures of animals or human figures, possibly rulers, from ancient civilizations, standalone. 

So the Aztec Sun Stone is a carved stone disc, so not a statue. The Khmer Buddhas could be standalone statues, like the ones at Angkor Thom, which are large faces. Those are similar to Olmec heads. So maybe Khmer Buddha statues would get a higher score, like 7 or 8?

Wait, the Olmec heads are heads, while the Buddha statues are full bodies but with large heads? Maybe the key is the colossal size and being a single monumental piece. 

So:

1. Terracotta Warriors: Many, so 3.

2. Persepolis: 1.

3. Khmer Buddha: 7.

4. Parthenon: 1.

5. Moai: 9 (since they're standalone, large, like the examples).

6. Trajan's Column: 0.

7. Aztec Sun Stone: 2.

8. Mayan reliefs: 1.

Wait, but the Mayan stone reliefs might be part of temples, so 0 or 1. The anti-examples include lamassu which are part of structures, so Mayan reliefs would be similar.

But maybe the Mayan reliefs are standalone? Not sure. Probably part of walls, so 1.

The Khmer Buddha statues like the Bayon's four faces are on the towers, so part of the structure. Hmm, maybe that's part of a building, so lower. Maybe 4.

Alternatively, if there are standalone Buddha statues, like the ones at Banteay Srei, but perhaps not as monumental as the examples. Maybe 5.

Hmm. Let me re-examine each candidate again carefully.

Terracotta Warriors: They are an army of statues, so not a single monumental piece. So maybe 3.

Persepolis reliefs: Definitely part of the building, so 0 or 1.

Khmer Buddha statues: The Bayon temple has massive faces on its towers, which are part of the structure. If the question is standalone, then those would be part of the structure. But there are also standalone statues, like some of the Avalokiteshvara statues. Not sure. Maybe 4 or 5.

Parthenon frieze: Part of the temple, so 1.

Moai: Definitely standalone, monumental, so 9.

Trajan's Column: Column with reliefs, like obelisks, so 0.

Aztec Sun Stone: A disk, not a statue, so 2.

Mayan stone reliefs: Part of structures, so 1.

So the scores would be:

1. Terracotta Warriors: 3

2. Persepolis reliefs: 1

3. Khmer Buddha statues: 5 (assuming some are standalone but not as exact as Moai)

4. Parthenon: 1

5. Moai: 9

6. Trajan's Column: 0

7. Aztec Sun Stone: 2

8. Mayan reliefs: 1

Wait, but the user said to use the full range from 0-10. Let me see if I can adjust for nuance.

Maybe the Terracotta Warriors are a collection of many, so less likely. Maybe 2.

Khmer Buddhas, if they are part of structures like the Bayon, which are monumental but part of the building, so 3? Or if there are standalone ones, maybe 6?

Alternatively, the Olmec heads are heads, and the Khmer statues might be full figures but still large and standalone. So maybe 7.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me think again.

The key is to match the specific theme from the examples but not the broader ones. The examples are all singular, colossal, monumental sculptures that are either zoomorphic (lion), anthropomorphic (human head), or a mix (sphinx). They are standalone, not part of a building. The anti-examples are either structures (obelisks, trilithons) or parts of structures (lamassu).

So candidates:

1. Terracotta Warriors: Many statues, part of a tomb's army. Not a single monumental piece. So low score, maybe 2.

2. Persepolis reliefs: Part of building, so 0.

3. Khmer Buddha statues: If they are standalone, like the ones at Angkor Wat's library or some temples, maybe 6 or 7. The Bayon's faces are part of the towers, so maybe those count as part of the structure, but there are standalone statues elsewhere. So maybe 5.

4. Parthenon frieze: Part of structure, 0.

5. Moai: Perfect fit, standalone, colossal, so 10.

6. Trajan's Column: Column with reliefs, so 0.

7. Aztec Sun Stone: A monolithic carving, but not a statue. It's a disc, so maybe 3?

Wait, the Aztec Sun Stone is a single, large stone carving, though not a statue. The examples are statues or sculptures of figures. So maybe 2.

8. Mayan stone reliefs: Part of structures, so 0 or 1.

Wait, but the Mayan stone reliefs might include standalone stelae, which are carved stone slabs depicting rulers. Oh, that's a good point! Stelae are standalone, like the ones at Tikal or Cop√°n. They are carved stone monuments depicting rulers, often with hieroglyphs. So those are standalone, monumental, and represent figures. That would be closer to the examples. So Mayan stone reliefs might include stelae, which are similar to the Olmec heads (both Mesoamerican, monumental, depicting rulers). So maybe Mayan stone reliefs (if referring to stelae) would score higher.

Hmm, the user's examples include the Colossal Olmec Head, which is part of the Olmec civilization, and Mayan stone reliefs could be stelae. So maybe Mayan stelae are a good match. So perhaps Mayan stone reliefs (if considering stelae) would be a 8?

Wait, the anti-examples include Assyrian lamassu which are protective deities, but the Mayan stelae are more like commemorative monuments, so maybe they are better.

So maybe Mayan stone reliefs (as stelae) are a 8 or 7. But if the question is about the exact theme, which includes the Olmec heads, Sphinx (which is a mythical creature), and Lion of Babylon (a lion statue). So the theme could be ancient monumental sculptures of rulers or deities, often zoomorphic or anthropomorphic, standalone.

Mayan stelae are anthropomorphic, depicting rulers, standalone, so that's a good fit. So maybe 8 or 9.

But I need to check the exact term: "Mayan stone reliefs" might refer to the carvings on temple walls, which are part of structures, but if they include stelae, which are standalone, then it's ambiguous. Since the question says "stone reliefs", perhaps they are part of buildings, so lower. Alternatively, the term might be used broadly. Since I'm not sure, I might have to assume they are part of structures, so lower score.

Alternatively, maybe the Mayan stone reliefs include both, but the examples are standalone, so if the candidate is ambiguous, maybe 5.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to make a list with the best possible scores based on the criteria:

1. Terracotta Warriors: 2 (many statues, not single monument)

2. Persepolis reliefs: 0 (part of building)

3. Khmer Buddha statues: 6 (some are standalone, large, but maybe not rulers)

4. Parthenon frieze: 0 (part of structure)

5. Moai: 10 (perfect fit)

6. Trajan's Column: 0 (column, not statue)

7. Aztec Sun Stone: 3 (monumental but not a figure)

8. Mayan stone reliefs: 7 (if stelae, then good; if wall carvings, lower. Maybe 7 as a middle ground)

Wait, maybe Mayan stone reliefs as stelae are a better match. So 8? Hmm, but the user's examples include the Olmec heads (which are heads, not full figures), the Sphinx (body and head), and the Lion (full body). The Mayan stelae are full figures of rulers, so maybe 8.

Alternatively, the Aztec Sun Stone is a calendar, not a figure, so 2.

So adjusting:

1. Terracotta Warriors: 3

2. Persepolis: 1

3. Khmer Buddha: 6

4. Parthenon: 1

5. Moai: 10

6. Trajan's Column: 0

7. Aztec Sun Stone: 2

8. Mayan reliefs: 8 (if considering stelae)

Alternatively, if Mayan reliefs are part of buildings, then 3.

Hmm, I'm a bit uncertain on Mayan reliefs. Since the examples are all standalone, if Mayan stone reliefs are part of structures like temple walls, then it's lower. But if they include stelae, which are standalone, then higher. The term "stone reliefs" can sometimes refer to carvings on surfaces, which might be part of buildings. So maybe 4?

Alternatively, maybe the Mayan stone reliefs are similar to the Persepolis ones, so 2.

This is tough. Let me proceed with the best possible reasoning, assuming that "Mayan stone reliefs" includes both types, but leaning towards part of structures. So 3.

Final scores:

1. Terracotta Warriors: 3 (they're many, not a single monument)

2. Persepolis reliefs: 1 (part of structure)

3. Khmer Buddha statues: 6 (if some are standalone and large)

4. Parthenon frieze: 1 (part of building)

5. Moai: 10 (matches perfectly)

6. Trajan's Column: 0 (column, not a statue)

7. Aztec Sun Stone: 2 (monumental but not a statue of a figure)

8. Mayan stone reliefs: 4 (if part of structures but with some standalone elements, or ambiguous)

Wait, maybe the Mayan stone reliefs are part of the broader theme but not the specific one. Since the examples are all singular, large sculptures, the Mayan stelae would be a better fit. So if "Mayan stone reliefs" includes stelae, then 8. But if not, lower.

Alternatively, the user's examples are all from ancient civilizations, and Mayan stelae are similar in purpose (commemorative, rulers), so maybe 8.

I think I need to make a decision here. Let's go with:

<number>1</number><score>3</score>

<number>2</number><score>1</score>

<number>3</number><score>6</score>

<number>4</number><score>1</score>

<number>5</number><score>10</score>

<number>6</number><score>0</score>

<number>7</number><score>2</score>

<number>8</number><score>7</score>

Because Mayan stone reliefs, if they include stelae (which are standalone monuments), then they are similar to the Olmec heads and Sphinx. So 7 or 8. Let's put 7 to be cautious.
