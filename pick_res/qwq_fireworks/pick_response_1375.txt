Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples provided are:

1. Periglacial weathering of exposed bedrock
2. Ice-driven rock splitting in coastal sea stacks
3. Frost wedging in mountain cliffs

Looking at these, I notice that all involve ice or frost as a key agent in breaking down rocks. Specifically, they mention processes like splitting, wedging, and weathering in cold environments. The common thread here is mechanical weathering caused by ice expansion. Periglacial areas are near glaciers, coastal sea stacks with ice, and mountain cliffs—so it's about ice-related physical breakdown.

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. Chemical weathering from acid rain
2. Dissolution of limestone
3. Glacial scouring of valleys

These are either chemical processes (acid rain, dissolution) or a different mechanical process (glacial scouring by ice movement, not freeze-thaw). The key here is that the anti-examples are either chemical or a different type of mechanical action (like abrasion from moving ice), not the freeze-thaw cycle.

So the specific theme must be mechanical weathering specifically caused by ice or frost, likely through the freeze-thaw cycle (frost wedging, ice-driven splitting). The anti-examples are excluded because they are chemical or a different mechanical process.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. Frost shattering of canyon walls: Frost wedging is exactly the process here. Canyon walls in cold areas would fit. This seems like a strong match. Maybe 8 or 9?

2. Oxidation of iron-rich rocks: Oxidation is a chemical process. The examples are all mechanical. So this is an anti-example type. 0 or 1?

3. Mechanical weathering from temperature changes: Temperature changes can cause expansion and contraction. But the examples are specifically about ice. However, if temperature changes lead to ice (like water freezing and expanding), then maybe it's related. But if it's just thermal expansion without ice, it's different. The wording here is vague. Maybe a 5 or so?

Wait, the examples all involve ice. So temperature changes leading to ice forming and expanding would be part of the theme. But if it's just thermal without ice, then not. The candidate says "mechanical weathering from temperature changes"—temperature changes can cause non-ice related mechanical weathering (like rock expanding and contracting without water). So it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe a 3 or 4? Hmm.

4. Salt crystallization in desert rocks: This is another form of mechanical weathering, but caused by salt expanding when it crystallizes, not ice. So it's similar in mechanism (expansion within cracks) but the agent is salt, not ice. So it's a related process but not the specific theme. Maybe a 2 or 3?

5. Biological weathering from lichens: That's biological, so different from the mechanical ice processes. Definitely an anti-example. 0 or 1.

6. Hydrothermal alteration of rocks: Chemical, involving heat and water. Not mechanical. 0.

7. Wind erosion of desert formations: Wind is a different mechanical agent (abrasion, deflation), not ice. So 0 or 1.

8. Sand blasting of rock formations: Similar to wind erosion, physical abrasion. So 0 or 1.

Wait, let me recheck each candidate:

1. Frost shattering: Exactly the same as frost wedging. So 10?

Wait the examples include periglacial, ice-driven splitting, and frost wedging. Frost shattering is another term for frost wedging. So that's a perfect match. So 10?

But the user said to use the full range and not just 10s. But maybe 10 is okay here.

2. Oxidation is chemical. So 0.

3. Mechanical from temp changes: If it's thermal expansion without ice, then it's a different process. But maybe the temp changes cause water to freeze. The question is whether the theme requires ice specifically. Since all examples involve ice, then temp changes leading to ice would fit. But the candidate doesn't specify ice. So it's a bit ambiguous. Maybe a 5? Because it's mechanical but not necessarily ice-driven. Hmm. The theme is ice-driven mechanical weathering. So if the temp changes are causing ice, then yes, but if it's just thermal expansion without water/ice, then no. Since the candidate doesn't specify, perhaps it's a 3 or 4.

4. Salt crystallization: Similar mechanism (expansion in cracks) but different agent (salt vs ice). So maybe a 2.

5. Biological: 0.

6. Hydrothermal: chemical. 0.

7. Wind erosion: 0.

8. Sand blasting: 0.

Wait but the user said the anti-examples are part of a broader theme. The specific theme is ice-driven mechanical weathering. The candidates need to match that exactly.

So let's re-express the theme: mechanical weathering processes specifically caused by ice or frost (frost wedging, ice splitting). So any process that involves ice forming, expanding, and breaking rock.

Candidate 1: Frost shattering (frost wedging) - 10.

Candidate 3: If temperature changes lead to ice, then maybe. But the candidate just says "temperature changes"—could be day-night without ice. So maybe 3? Since it's mechanical but not specifically ice.

Candidate 4: Salt crystallization is a different mechanical process (haloclasty), so 2.

Others are 0.

Wait but the user's anti-examples include "glacial scouring of valleys"—which is mechanical but from moving ice, not freeze-thaw. So that's why it's an anti-example. So the key is that the theme is freeze-thaw or ice expansion in cracks, not movement.

So candidate 3: mechanical weathering from temp changes. If that temp change is causing water to freeze and expand (like frost wedging), then yes. But if it's just expansion from heat, then no. Since the candidate doesn't specify ice, maybe it's a 4? Because it's in the ballpark but not exact.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is specifically ice-driven, so temp changes that lead to ice would count. But since the candidate doesn't specify, it's ambiguous. So perhaps 4?

Let me recheck the examples again. The examples all mention ice or frost. So the theme is specifically ice or frost as the agent. So any process where ice is the cause. So:

1. Frost shattering: yes, 10.

2. Oxidation: no, 0.

3. Temperature changes causing mechanical weathering—only counts if the temp changes involve ice. Since it's not specified, perhaps it's a 3 or 4.

4. Salt crystallization: 2.

5. Biological: 0.

6. Hydrothermal: 0.

7. Wind: 0.

8. Sand: 0.

So the scores would be:

1. 10

2. 0

3. 4

4. 2

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

Wait but the user said to use the full range. Maybe adjust a bit. Let's see.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 3 is a 5. Because temperature changes leading to ice would be part of the theme, but since it's not specified, it's a possible 5. Hmm.

Alternatively, the user's examples are all about ice in periglacial, coastal, and mountain areas. So maybe temperature changes that involve freezing are part of the theme. So if "temperature changes" here refers to freeze-thaw cycles, then it's a match. But the term "temperature changes" is broader. Since the candidate doesn't specify, it's ambiguous. So maybe a 5.

Similarly, candidate 4's salt is a mechanical process but not ice, so 2.

But let me see the anti-examples include "chemical weathering from acid rain" which is chemical, so the theme is specifically mechanical via ice. So any mechanical process not involving ice is lower.

Candidate 3 is mechanical but the cause is temp changes (could be ice or not). If it's ice, then yes. Since it's unclear, maybe 3?

Alternatively, the question is to match the specific theme exactly. Since the theme is ice-driven, any process that is mechanical and ice-driven gets a high score. If the candidate doesn't mention ice, even if it's a similar mechanism (like salt), it's lower.

So for candidate 3, if "temperature changes" lead to ice, then yes, but if not, then no. Since it's not specified, maybe it's a 3.

Similarly, candidate 4 is similar but with salt, so 2.

So final scores:

1. 10

2. 0

3. 3

4. 2

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

Wait but the user said to use the full range. Maybe some candidates are in the middle. Let's check again.

Wait candidate 7: wind erosion. The anti-example includes "glacial scouring" which is a type of abrasion by ice. Wind erosion is abrasion by wind, but that's a different agent. So 0.

Candidate 8: sand blasting is same as wind erosion. 0.

Candidate 3: maybe 5. If temperature changes include freezing and thawing, then it's part of the theme. Since the theme's examples all involve freezing, maybe temp changes that cause freezing would count. But since the candidate doesn't specify ice, it's a 5? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme requires the explicit mention of ice or frost. In that case, candidate 3's "temperature changes" without ice would be lower. So 3.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky, but I think I'll proceed with the first assessment.
