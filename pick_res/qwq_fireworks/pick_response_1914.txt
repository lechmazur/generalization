Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are: a kiva of the Ancestral Puebloans, a sweat lodge of various North American tribes, and a stone circle like Stonehenge built by Neolithic Britons. The anti-examples are medicine wheels, effigy mounds, and burial mounds.

So, what's the common theme here? The examples are all structures with a ritual or ceremonial purpose. Kivas were used for religious and social activities by the Pueblo peoples. Sweat lodges are ceremonial structures for purification rituals. Stonehenge is believed to have been a ritual site aligned with astronomical events. 

Now, the anti-examples are medicine wheels (which are also ceremonial but maybe more symbolic or related to astronomical markers), effigy mounds (earthworks in shapes, often ceremonial but not structures for active rituals), and burial mounds (primarily for interment, which is a different purpose). So the key difference might be that the specific theme is structures used for active ceremonial or ritual activities, not just symbolic markers or burial sites.

Looking at the candidates:

1. An igloo: Igloos are temporary shelters made of snow, primarily for living, not ceremonial. So probably a 0 or low score.
2. A teepee: A portable dwelling of Plains Native Americans. Again, a residence, so low score.
3. A pyramid: Pyramids like Egyptian ones were tombs or temples. Wait, Egyptian pyramids are tombs (burial purpose, so maybe anti-example?), but Mayan pyramids were temples for rituals. Hmm, need to consider context. Since the theme includes ceremonial structures, maybe some pyramids qualify, but the example given is ambiguous. Maybe a 5 or 6?
4. A kiva used as a living space: The original kiva is a ceremonial site, but if it's repurposed as living space, that's against the theme. So maybe a 0 or 1.
5. A marae of the Māori: Marae includes a meeting ground and a wharenui (meeting house), often used for ceremonies and gatherings. That seems similar to the examples, so maybe a 8 or 9?
6. A ziggurat: Mesopotamian ziggurats were temple structures, sacred, so likely high score like 8 or 9.
7. A totem pole: Totem poles are symbolic, sometimes part of rituals but not structures for ceremonies. More decorative or commemorative. So maybe 3 or 4.
8. A longhouse: A communal living structure, so low score like 1 or 2.

Wait, need to check each against the specific theme. The theme is structures built for specific ceremonial/ritual purposes by their cultures, not dwellings or symbolic markers. 

1. Igloo: Living, so 0. 
2. Teepee: Living, 0. 
3. Pyramid: If it's a temple pyramid (like Mayan), then yes. Since pyramids can vary, but since the question doesn't specify, maybe assume a general pyramid. The Egyptian ones are tombs (anti-example?), but others are temples. Maybe a 7?
4. Kiva as living space: Original purpose is ceremonial, but repurposed. So 0 or 1. Since it's a kiva but not used for its intended purpose, maybe 1.
5. Marae: Definitely ceremonial and communal for rituals, so 10? But wait, the examples are specific structures. Marae includes a complex, but the wharenui is part of it. Maybe 9.
6. Ziggurat: Definitely ceremonial, so 10? But the examples are from specific cultures. Ziggurats are Mesopotamian, so maybe matches the theme. 9 or 10.
7. Totem pole: Not a structure for rituals, so 2.
8. Longhouse: Living, so 0 or 1.

But the anti-examples include burial mounds, so burial isn't the theme. So pyramids as temples (ceremonial) would be good. Maybe:

3. Pyramid: 8 (assuming temple)
4. Kiva as living: 1
5. Marae: 9
6. Ziggurat: 9
7. Totem pole: 2
8. Longhouse: 0

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Let me adjust again. Need to ensure scores are spread out. Let me think again:

1. Igloo: 0
2. Teepee: 0
3. Pyramid (assuming ceremonial): 8
4. Kiva living: 1 (since it's a kiva but misused)
5. Marae: 9 (ritual use)
6. Ziggurat: 9
7. Totem pole: 2 (not a structure for rituals)
8. Longhouse: 0

But maybe ziggurat is 10? Since it's a temple. The examples are all structures used for specific rituals. So maybe:

3. Pyramid (as temple): 9
6. Ziggurat: 9 or 10. Since the examples include Stonehenge (non-residential, ritual), ziggurat is a temple. Maybe 10. But the user might want to differentiate. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "ritual structures of ancient cultures not primarily for burial or symbolic purposes." So burial mounds are anti-examples. So pyramids that are tombs (Egypt) would be anti-examples, but those that are temples (Maya) are examples. Since the question doesn't specify, maybe the candidate "a pyramid" is ambiguous. So perhaps give it a 6 because it depends on context but generally can be ceremonial. 

Similarly, marae is definitely ceremonial. Ziggurat is temple. So maybe:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 6
4. 1
5. 9
6. 9
7. 2
8. 0

But need to make sure all scores are used. Let me check again:

- The examples are all structures with a primary ritual/ceremonial function. The anti-examples are either symbolic (medicine wheel), burial (mound), or earthworks (effigy). 

So:

1. Igloo: dwelling → 0
2. Teepee: dwelling → 0
3. Pyramid: If it's a temple (like Mayan), then 8-9. Since it's a general term, maybe 7
4. Kiva as living: 1 (since it's a kiva but not used for rituals)
5. Marae: 9
6. Ziggurat: 9
7. Totem pole: 2
8. Longhouse: 0

That's better. So the scores would be:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 7
4. 1
5. 9
6. 9
7. 2
8. 0

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Maybe adjust to spread more. Let me think again.

Alternatively, for the pyramid, if it's a temple like Egyptian ones (though Egyptians are tombs but others are temples), maybe 6. 

Ziggurat is definitely temple, so 9 or 10. Let's go with 9. 

Marae is 9 or 10. 

So:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 7
4. 1
5. 9
6. 9
7. 2
8. 0

That uses 0,1,2,7,9. Maybe the totem pole is 3? Since it's somewhat symbolic but not a structure for rituals. Maybe 3 instead of 2.

Then:

7. 3

So:

1.0, 2.0, 3.7,4.1,5.9,6.9,7.3,8.0

That's better. 

Alternatively, maybe the longhouse is sometimes used for ceremonies? Like Iroquois longhouses had a central fire for gatherings. But primarily residential. Maybe 1?

But the question says anti-examples are burial mounds etc. So longhouse is living, so 0.

Final scores as per above.
