Alright, let's tackle this. The user provided three examples: Vienna Secession, Fluxus, and Dadaism. Then three anti-examples: Performance Art, Street Art, Surrealism. Need to figure out the specific theme that the examples share but the anti-examples don't.

First, let's analyze the examples. Vienna Secession was an art movement around 1897 in Vienna, breaking away from traditional academies, emphasizing modern art. Fluxus is an avant-garde movement from the 60s, known for intermedia and blending different art forms. Dadaism started during WWI, anti-war, anti-bourgeois, experimental, and absurd.

Looking for commonalities: all are avant-garde movements that were radical, challenging existing norms, and emerged in specific historical contexts (early 20th century or mid-20th). They are more about challenging traditional art forms, maybe with a focus on conceptual or anti-art aspects.

Now the anti-examples: Performance Art is more about live presentations, which can be part of avant-garde but perhaps not as specifically tied to the historical movements listed. Street Art is public, often urban, but again, maybe too broad or not as movement-specific. Surrealism is an art movement but more focused on the unconscious and dreams, which is different from Dada's anti-art or Fluxus's intermedia.

So the specific theme might be avant-garde art movements that are specifically 20th-century, radical, and challenging established norms, possibly with a focus on conceptual or anti-art aspects, but not necessarily the broader categories like performance or street art.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. Conceptual Art: Mid-20th century, focuses on ideas over aesthetics. It's avant-garde, challenging traditional forms. Close to Dada and Fluxus in challenging norms. Maybe a 7 or 8?

2. Impressionism: 19th century, more about technique and light. Not as radical or avant-garde in the same way. Probably lower, like 3 or 4.

3. Minimalism: Mid-20th, reduces art to basics, conceptual. Shares some with Vienna Secession's modernism but maybe less radical. Maybe 5 or 6?

4. Outsider Art: Not a movement but art by self-taught artists. Doesn't fit the movement structure of the examples. Maybe 2.

5. Pop Art: Mid-20th, uses popular culture. It's a movement but more about consumerism. Not as radical or anti-establishment as Dada. Maybe 4?

6. Installation Art: More about 3D environments. It's a medium rather than a movement. Not exactly a historical movement like the examples. Maybe 3?

7. Abstract Expressionism: Mid-20th, emotional abstraction. Part of the New York School, challenging traditional forms. Maybe 6 or 7?

8. Futurism: Early 20th century, focused on technology and speed. Avant-garde, anti-traditional. Similar to Dada's era and radicalism. Maybe 8 or 9?

Wait, need to ensure not to include broader themes. For example, Surrealism is an anti-example, so maybe the theme excludes movements focused on dreams. Futurism is a good fit because it's an early 20th-century avant-garde movement. Vienna Secession is early 1900s, Fluxus mid-60s, Dada early 20s. So Futurism (early 20s) aligns. 

So Futurism would be high. Let's adjust:

Futurism (8) maybe 9.

Conceptual Art (1) maybe 7.5 (7)

Abstract Expressionism (7) maybe 6.

Minimalism (3) 5.

Installation (6) 3.

Outsider Art (4) 2.

Impressionism (2) 3.

Pop Art (5) 4.

Wait, but need to check if Pop Art is more aligned. Dada was anti-art, while Pop was more playful with culture. Maybe Pop is lower.

So final scores:

1. Conceptual Art: 7 (avant-garde, conceptual, anti-traditional)
2. Impressionism: 3 (too traditional, 19th century)
3. Minimalism: 5 (conceptual but less radical)
4. Outsider Art: 2 (not a movement)
5. Pop Art: 4 (movement but less radical)
6. Installation Art: 3 (medium, not a movement)
7. Abstract Expressionism: 6 (avant-garde, but more about emotion)
8. Futurism: 9 (avant-garde, early 20th century, radical)
