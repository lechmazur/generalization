Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples provided. The examples given are:

- Moai statues on Rapa Nui (Easter Island) constructed from volcanic tuff
- Marae platforms in the Marquesas Islands built with basalt blocks
- Petroglyphs carved into basalt flows in Hawai'i

And the anti-examples are:

- Obsidian arrowheads in North America
- Sandstone carvings in Australia
- Granite tools in Japan

So, the task is to determine the common theme among the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while avoiding the broader or related themes that the anti-examples might represent.

Starting with the examples:

1. Moai statues are made of volcanic tuff. Volcanic tuff is a type of volcanic rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash.
2. Marae platforms use basalt blocks. Basalt is another volcanic rock, often found in lava flows.
3. Petroglyphs in Hawaii are carved into basalt flows. Again, basalt is volcanic.

So, the commonality here seems to be that all examples are monumental or significant structures/artworks made from volcanic rocks (tuff and basalt). The key points are:

- They are constructed or carved from volcanic rock (specifically tuff and basalt).
- They are large-scale or culturally significant structures/artworks (statues, platforms, petroglyphs).

Looking at the anti-examples to see what they represent and exclude:

1. Obsidian arrowheads: Obsidian is a volcanic glass, but arrowheads are tools, not large structures. The anti-example here might be excluding small tools, even if made from volcanic material.
2. Sandstone carvings: Sandstone is a sedimentary rock, not volcanic. So non-volcanic stone is excluded.
3. Granite tools: Granite is an igneous rock but formed from cooled magma (intrusive), not volcanic (extrusive like basalt or tuff). So non-volcanic igneous rocks are excluded, and tools again might be excluded as they are functional rather than monumental.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely: **Large-scale or monumental structures/artworks made from volcanic rocks (like basalt or tuff)**.

Now, evaluating each candidate against this theme:

1. **Limestone sculptures in Thailand**: Limestone is a sedimentary rock, not volcanic. So it's like the anti-example (sandstone carvings). Score: 0 or 1? Since it's a sculpture (monumental?), but wrong rock type. Probably 0 or 1.

2. **Stone adzes fashioned from obsidian in the Solomon Islands**: Obsidian is volcanic, but adzes are tools, not monumental structures. The anti-example (obsidian arrowheads) also tools. So this is similar to an anti-example. Score: 1 or 2.

3. **Cave paintings in Indonesia**: These are paintings, not made from volcanic rock. The surface might be in a cave (maybe volcanic?), but the material is paint. Doesn't fit. Score: 0.

4. **Wood carvings in Papua New Guinea**: Wood isn't volcanic rock. So definitely not. Score: 0.

5. **Volcanic hot springs in New Zealand**: Natural geological features, not human-made structures. So not fitting the theme. Score: 0 or maybe 1 if considering volcanic association but not human-made. Probably 0.

6. **Volcanic eruptions in Iceland**: Natural phenomenon, not human-made. So 0.

7. **Jade ornaments in New Zealand**: Jade is a metamorphic rock, not volcanic. Ornaments are small items. So similar to obsidian arrowheads. Score: 0 or 1.

8. **Marble statues in Greece**: Marble is a metamorphic rock (from limestone), so not volcanic. Even though statues are monumental, the material is wrong. So like the sandstone carvings. Score: 0 or 1.

Wait, but let me check again. The examples are all volcanic rocks (tuff and basalt). The anti-examples include non-volcanic (sandstone, granite) and tools. So the key is volcanic rock and monumental structures.

So any candidate that is a monument made from volcanic rock would score high. If the material is volcanic but not a monument (like tools or small items), lower. Non-volcanic but monument would be like the anti-examples (sandstone carvings, etc.), so low.

Looking again:

1. Limestone sculptures: non-volcanic, but monumental. Since the anti-examples include sandstone carvings (non-volcanic, but carvings), so this is similar. So score 0-2. Maybe 1.

2. Obsidian adzes: volcanic material but tools. Anti-example is obsidian arrowheads (tools). So similar to anti-example, so 1-2. Let's say 2.

3. Cave paintings: not made of volcanic rock, so 0.

4. Wood carvings: not volcanic. 0.

5. Volcanic hot springs: natural, not human-made. 0.

6. Volcanic eruptions: natural. 0.

7. Jade ornaments: non-volcanic and small. 0.

8. Marble statues: non-volcanic but monumental. So like sandstone carvings in Australia (anti-example). So 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

Wait, but the anti-examples include sandstone carvings, which are carvings in non-volcanic rock. So the candidate 1 is sculptures (which are carvings?) in limestone (non-volcanic). So exactly like the anti-example. So same as the anti-example's sandstone carvings in Australia. Therefore, the score for candidate 1 would be 0. Similarly, candidate 8 (marble statues) is like the sandstone carvings. So 0.

Wait, but maybe marble is a different category. Let me confirm:

The anti-examples are:

- Sandstone carvings (non-volcanic rock, carvings)
- Granite tools (non-volcanic igneous, tools)
- Obsidian arrowheads (volcanic material, but tools)

So the anti-examples include non-volcanic rocks used in carvings (sandstone) and tools (granite and obsidian). The theme is volcanic rocks used in monumental structures.

So any candidate that is a monument made of volcanic rock would be good (like the examples). Candidates that are monuments but non-volcanic (like sandstone or marble) would be like the anti-examples (sandstone carvings) so 0. Candidates that are volcanic but tools (like obsidian adzes) are like the anti-examples (obsidian arrowheads), so low scores. Candidates that are natural features (hot springs, eruptions) are 0. Wood carvings, not volcanic.

So the scores:

1. Limestone sculptures: non-volcanic monument → 0 (like anti-example)
2. Obsidian adzes: volcanic but tool → 2 (since it's volcanic but tool, like an anti-example but maybe slightly different? Hmm, maybe 1)
Wait, the obsidian arrowheads are anti-examples. So this is similar, so 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to be more nuanced. Let me reassess each candidate again:

1. Limestone sculptures: non-volcanic, but similar to the anti-example (sandstone carvings). So same category, so 0.

2. Stone adzes (obsidian): volcanic (obsidian is volcanic), but tools. So similar to anti-example (obsidian arrowheads). So 1 or 2. Let's say 2.

3. Cave paintings: not made of volcanic rock, so 0.

4. Wood carvings: no volcanic rock, 0.

5. Volcanic hot springs: natural, not human-made. So 0.

6. Volcanic eruptions: natural, 0.

7. Jade ornaments: jade is metamorphic, not volcanic. Ornaments are small, so like anti-example tools. 0.

8. Marble statues: marble is metamorphic, non-volcanic. So like sandstone carvings → 0.

Wait, but maybe the marble statues are monumental? The examples include statues (moai). But the difference is material. So the examples are volcanic, so marble is not, so 0. The anti-examples include sandstone carvings, so same category.

Thus, the scores would be:

1. 0

2. 2

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

Wait, but maybe I missed some nuance. Let me check again. Are there any candidates that might be closer?

Looking at candidate 5: Volcanic hot springs in New Zealand. They are natural features made from volcanic activity, but not human-made. The examples are all human-made structures. So definitely 0.

Candidate 2: Obsidian is volcanic, but it's tools. The anti-examples include obsidian arrowheads (tools). So this is exactly like an anti-example. So maybe 1.

Candidate 7: Jade is non-volcanic. So even though they are ornaments, but material is wrong. So 0.

Hmm, but what about the "volcanic hot springs" – maybe they are associated with volcanic activity, but not made of volcanic rock. So no.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is specifically about human-made structures from volcanic rocks. So any human-made structure using volcanic rock would score higher.

Wait, the examples are all human-made. The anti-examples are human-made but either wrong material or form (tools).

So:

- If a candidate is a human-made structure/artifact made of volcanic rock, but not a monument? Like the adzes (tools) would be lower. But if it's a monument made of volcanic rock, that's a 10.

So let's see:

Candidate 2: obsidian adzes – tools, volcanic material. Since the examples are all monumental, this is like an anti-example (tools), so low score. 1 or 2.

Candidate 8: marble statues. Non-volcanic but statues (monumental). Since the theme requires volcanic rock, so 0.

Candidate 1: limestone sculptures. Non-volcanic but sculptures (monumental). So like the anti-example sandstone carvings → 0.

So the only possible candidates that might have some points are those that are volcanic but not exactly matching, but I don't see any except maybe candidate 2.

Wait, what about candidate 7: Jade ornaments in New Zealand. Jade is not volcanic. So 0.

Candidate 5 and 6 are natural, so 0.

So the highest score would be candidate 2 at 2, others 0 except maybe none. Wait but the user wants a range from 0-10, so maybe some candidates have higher scores?

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think again.

The examples are:

- Moai statues (volcanic tuff, statues)
- Marae platforms (basalt blocks, platforms)
- Petroglyphs (carved into basalt flows)

So the common elements are:

- Made from volcanic rock (tuff or basalt)
- Human-made structures or artworks
- Monumental in scale or cultural significance (statues, platforms, petroglyphs are not small tools)

The anti-examples are:

- Obsidian arrowheads: volcanic material, but tools (so form is wrong)
- Sandstone carvings: non-volcanic, but similar form (carvings) to petroglyphs
- Granite tools: non-volcanic, tools

Thus, the theme is: human-made, monumental structures or artworks made from volcanic rocks (tuff or basalt).

Now, evaluating candidates:

1. Limestone sculptures: non-volcanic rock, but sculptures (monumental). So similar to the anti-example sandstone carvings. So score 0.

2. Stone adzes from obsidian: volcanic material (obsidian is volcanic), but tools (form is wrong). Similar to anti-example arrowheads. Score 1.

3. Cave paintings: not made of volcanic rock, so 0.

4. Wood carvings: no volcanic rock. 0.

5. Volcanic hot springs: natural, not human-made. 0.

6. Volcanic eruptions: natural. 0.

7. Jade ornaments: non-volcanic rock, ornaments (tools/small items). 0.

8. Marble statues: non-volcanic rock, but statues (monumental form). Similar to sandstone carvings (anti-example), so 0.

Wait, but maybe some have slightly higher? Let me see if any candidates use volcanic rock but in the wrong form or vice versa.

Wait, candidate 2 uses volcanic rock (obsidian) but in the form of tools (anti-example). So it's exactly like the anti-example. So 1.

Candidate 1 is similar to an anti-example (sandstone carvings) but with limestone. So same category. 0.

Others are all 0 except candidate 2 is 1.

But the user said to use the full range 0-10. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check each again.

Wait, perhaps the theme is more specific. Let me think again.

Wait, the examples are all made of volcanic rocks (tuff and basalt) and are structures (statues, platforms) or petroglyphs (carved into volcanic rock). The anti-examples are made of non-volcanic (sandstone, granite) or volcanic tools (obsidian arrowheads).

So the key is volcanic rock + either structures, statues, or petroglyphs (carvings on volcanic rock). So carvings on volcanic rock (like petroglyphs) are okay, but carvings in non-volcanic rock (sandstone) are not.

Wait, the petroglyphs are carved into basalt flows (volcanic). So carvings on volcanic rock are allowed. So if a candidate is a carving in volcanic rock, that would be good. For example, if there was a petroglyph in the candidates, that would score high.

Looking at the candidates again:

1. Limestone sculptures: sculptures in non-volcanic rock. 0.

2. Obsidian adzes: volcanic material but tools. 1.

3. Cave paintings: not made of volcanic rock. 0.

4. Wood carvings: non-volcanic. 0.

5. Volcanic hot springs: natural. 0.

6. Eruptions: natural. 0.

7. Jade ornaments: non-volcanic. 0.

8. Marble statues: non-volcanic. 0.

Hmm, so only candidate 2 gets a 1, others 0. But the user wants a scale up to 10, so maybe some candidates are partially matching?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the form. Let me check the examples again:

- Moai: statues (sculptures), made of volcanic tuff.

- Marae: platforms built with basalt blocks (structures).

- Petroglyphs: carvings into volcanic rock (basalt flows).

So the form can be sculptures, platforms (structures), or carvings into volcanic rock. So carvings into volcanic rock are acceptable, but carvings in non-volcanic rock are not.

Looking at the candidates again:

Is there any candidate that is a carving into volcanic rock? Let me see:

Candidate 3: Cave paintings. The cave might be in volcanic rock, but the paintings are made of paint, not carved into the rock. So not.

Candidate 7: Jade ornaments. Jade is not volcanic, and they are ornaments.

Candidate 2: Adzes are tools, made of volcanic rock, but form is wrong.

Candidate 5: Volcanic hot springs are natural, not carved.

So no candidates are using volcanic rock in the form of sculptures, structures, or carvings except maybe none. Thus, all are 0 except candidate 2 (1). But the user wants a scale up to 10. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the theme also requires the structures to be in the Pacific? The examples are Easter Island, Marquesas, Hawaii – all Pacific. The anti-examples are North America, Australia, Japan. The candidates include Solomon Islands (Pacific), New Zealand (Pacific), Papua New Guinea (Pacific), Greece (Mediterranean), Thailand (Southeast Asia).

If the theme includes geographical region, but the examples didn't specify that. The user didn't mention location as part of the theme. So probably not.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "volcanic rock used in monumental human-made structures or carvings". So any such structure would fit. The anti-examples are either non-volcanic or small items.

Looking at the candidates again:

Is there any candidate that uses volcanic rock for a structure or carving?

Candidate 2: adzes (tools) made of obsidian. So volcanic but tools.

Candidate 5: volcanic hot springs – natural, not human-made.

Candidate 6: eruptions – natural.

Candidate 7: jade (non-volcanic).

Candidate 8: marble (non-volcanic).

Candidate 1: limestone (non-volcanic).

Candidate 3: cave paintings (material not volcanic).

Candidate 4: wood (non-volcanic).

So only candidate 2 uses volcanic material, but it's a tool. So score 1.

Wait, but maybe the form is not strictly "monumental" but any structure? The examples include platforms and statues, which are large. Petroglyphs are carvings on rock surfaces, so they are monumental in the sense of being in place.

So maybe candidate 3: cave paintings. If the caves are in volcanic rock, but the paintings themselves are not carved into the rock. So no.

Alternatively, if there was a candidate like "volcanic rock carvings", that would score high, but none exist here.

Thus, the only possible points are candidate 2 at 1, others 0. But the user wants a range up to 10. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in considering the examples. Let me see:

The examples are all in the Pacific, but the theme might not be location-based. The key is volcanic rock + monumental/human-made structures or carvings.

Looking at candidate 2: obsidian adzes. Even though they're tools, they're made from volcanic rock. So maybe a slight score because of the material but form is wrong. Maybe 2?

Similarly, if another candidate had volcanic rock in a structure but not exactly a statue or platform, maybe a 5?

Wait, candidate 5: volcanic hot springs. Not human-made. So no.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a candidate that uses volcanic rock but in a structure. Let me check again:

None of the candidates use volcanic rock for a structure except candidate 2's material is volcanic but form is tool.

Wait, maybe the "volcanic hot springs" are formed from volcanic activity, but they're natural features. So not.

Alternatively, the "volcanic eruptions" are natural events. So no.

Thus, perhaps the scores are all 0 except candidate 2 is 1 or 2. But the user wants a scale up to 10, so maybe I need to consider other aspects.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "volcanic rock used in prehistoric human-made structures or artworks". The examples are all Polynesian, but the anti-examples are from other regions. Maybe the candidates from Polynesia get higher scores?

Looking at the candidates:

2. Solomon Islands (Pacific/Polynesian? The Solomon Islands are Melanesian, but part of the Pacific region). If the theme is Pacific region, then maybe that's a factor. The examples are all in the Pacific.

But the user didn't specify location as part of the theme. So maybe not.

Alternatively, the theme is "volcanic rock used in large-scale human-made structures or petroglyphs". So any candidate that uses volcanic rock for such purposes would score high.

Since none of the candidates do except maybe none, except candidate 2 is volcanic but tool. So it's the closest but still low.

Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the theme. Let me try another angle.

The examples are all made of volcanic rocks (tuff, basalt) and are cultural/monumental structures. The anti-examples use non-volcanic rocks (sandstone, granite) or volcanic but tools.

So the key is volcanic rock plus monumental/cultural purpose.

Looking at the candidates again:

1. Limestone sculptures: non-volcanic, but monumental → 0 (like anti-example)
2. Obsidian adzes: volcanic, but tools → 1 (like anti-example)
3. Cave paintings: non-volcanic → 0
4. Wood carvings: non-volcanic →0
5. Volcanic hot springs: natural →0
6. Eruptions: natural →0
7. Jade ornaments: non-volcanic →0
8. Marble statues: non-volcanic →0

So the scores would be:

1. 0

2. 1

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants a scale up to 10. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the "volcanic hot springs" are associated with volcanic activity, but not made of volcanic rock. So not.

Alternatively, maybe "volcanic rock" includes other types like pumice or andesite. But the examples use tuff and basalt. The anti-examples include obsidian (a volcanic glass) as a tool, so maybe the theme excludes glass? Or is obsidian considered volcanic?

Yes, obsidian is volcanic. So candidate 2 uses volcanic material but form is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the form is flexible as long as it's monumental. But adzes are tools, not monumental.

Hmm. Since the user insists on using the full range, maybe I need to assign some middle scores for partial matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme also requires the rock to be a specific type like tuff or basalt. The examples use those, while the anti-examples use obsidian (a different volcanic rock but used for tools) and others.

Wait, the anti-examples include obsidian arrowheads (volcanic but tools), so the theme excludes tools even if volcanic. So the material must be volcanic, form must be monumental, and not tools.

So candidate 2 is volcanic but tool → 1.

Other candidates:

Candidate 5: volcanic hot springs (natural) →0.

Candidate 7: jade (non-volcanic) →0.

Candidate 8: marble (non-volcanic) →0.

Candidate 1: limestone (non-volcanic) →0.

Candidate 3: cave paintings →0.

Candidate 4: wood →0.

Candidate 6: eruptions →0.

So only candidate 2 gets 1. The rest 0. But the user wants a range up to 10. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "volcanic rock used in cultural or monumental structures", so even if the form is not exactly a statue or platform, but another structure.

For example, if there was a "volcanic rock temple", that would be good. But none of the candidates.

Alternatively, perhaps the "cave paintings" are in volcanic caves, so the location is volcanic, but the material isn't. So no.

Alternatively, maybe "volcanic eruptions" as a theme? No, they are natural.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that the examples are all Polynesian, so maybe the theme includes region? The user didn't say that, but the anti-examples are outside. Candidates 2 (Solomon Islands, which is Pacific), 5 and 7 are New Zealand (Pacific), 4 is Papua New Guinea (Pacific). So maybe these have a regional aspect.

If the theme includes being in the Pacific, then:

- Candidates from Pacific region might get higher scores even if material is off?

But the user said not to consider broader themes, just the specific theme from examples. Since the examples are in Pacific but the theme is material and form, not location.

Hmm, this is tricky. Given the user's instruction to use the full range, perhaps I need to assign some higher scores where possible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing that "volcanic rock" includes other types. Let me think:

The examples use tuff and basalt. The candidates:

- Candidate 2 uses obsidian (volcanic glass, still volcanic)
- Candidate 5: volcanic hot springs (not made of volcanic rock)
- Candidate 6: eruptions (natural)
- Candidate 7: jade (metamorphic)
- Candidate 8: marble (metamorphic)

So only candidate 2 uses volcanic rock but in a tool form.

Perhaps the form is more important. The examples are all structures/artworks, so any structure made from volcanic rock would score high. If there was a candidate like "basalt statues", that would be a 10. But none of the candidates do that.

Alternatively, maybe the "stone adzes" are tools, but made of volcanic rock. Since the theme excludes tools but includes any structures, maybe it's a 2.

The other candidates use non-volcanic rocks, so 0.

Alternatively, maybe the "volcanic hot springs" are associated with volcanic activity, so they get a 1? No, they're natural.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. According to the strict analysis, only candidate 2 gets a 1, others 0. But to use the full range, perhaps adjust:

- Candidate 2: 2

- Candidate 1: since it's sculptures (like statues but wrong material), maybe 1?

- Candidate 5: maybe 1 because it's volcanic but natural.

Wait, but the examples are all human-made. So natural features are 0.

Candidate 8: marble statues (wrong material but same form as statues in example) → maybe 1?

Similarly, candidate 1: sculptures (same form as statues) but wrong material → 1.

Candidate 2: tool (wrong form) but volcanic →1.

So:

1. 1

2. 1

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.1

But then two candidates at 1 and one at 1. Still limited.

Alternatively, maybe the "volcanic hot springs" are made of volcanic rock (like basalt), so if the spring is in a volcanic area, but the spring itself is water. Not made of rock. So no.

Hmm. Given the user's instruction, perhaps I'll proceed with the initial assessment:

1.0

2.1

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.0

But the user wants a full range. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the theme is "volcanic rock used in ancient human-made structures", excluding tools. So:

- Candidate 2 is a tool →1.

- Candidate 8 is marble (non-volcanic), but statues (form matches) → maybe 2? Because form matches but material wrong.

Wait, the examples' form is sculptures (statues), platforms (structures), carvings (petroglyphs). So statues are part of the form. Thus, candidate 8 is a statue (form matches) but wrong material → maybe 2?

Similarly, candidate 1 is sculptures (form) but wrong material →2?

Candidate 2 is tool (form doesn't match) but material right →1?

Candidate 5 and 6 are natural →0.

Candidate 3: paintings (not carved) →0.

Candidate 4: wood →0.

Candidate 7: ornaments (tools) →0.

So:

1.2

2.1

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.2

That uses more of the scale.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 8's statues are monumental but wrong material → 3?

Candidate 1's sculptures (same form) but wrong material →3?

Candidate 2's tools (wrong form) but volcanic →1.

This way:

1.3

2.1

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.3

This uses more of the scale. Maybe that's better.

Alternatively, if the material is the primary factor, then:

- Volcanic material but wrong form →1-2

- Non-volcanic but form matches →1-3

- Both wrong →0

So:

1.3 (non-volcanic but form matches)

2.2 (volcanic but form wrong)

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.3 (non-volcanic but form matches)

That uses 0,1,2,3.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 8's marble statues are closer to the examples' form (statues), so 3.

Candidate 1: sculptures (statues) →3.

Candidate 2: tools (adzes) but volcanic →1.

This way, the scores are:

1.3

2.1

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.3

Thus, using 0,1,3.

Alternatively, maybe even higher. For example:

- If a candidate has both form and material correct →10.

- If material correct but form wrong →5?

Wait, but no candidates have material correct except candidate 2.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The user might expect that the theme is "volcanic rock used in monumental structures or carvings", so any candidate with volcanic rock and a structure/carving would score high. Since only candidate 2 uses volcanic but it's a tool, so 2. Others are non-volcanic: 0.

Alternatively, the user might consider that "carvings into basalt" (example) would include any carvings in volcanic rock. So if a candidate is a carving in volcanic rock, even if not the examples' form, but the question is, are there any such candidates?

Looking again:

Candidates:

3. Cave paintings: not carvings, so no.

2. Adzes are carved tools, but the material is volcanic. So maybe it's a carving in volcanic rock (the adze is carved from obsidian). So the form is a tool, but it's a carving. The examples include petroglyphs (carvings into rock). So maybe the form of "carving" is acceptable, but the purpose (tool vs. petroglyph) matters.

Petroglyphs are for cultural/religious, adzes are functional. So maybe candidate 2's form is a carving but for tools, so lower score.

But since the examples include carvings (petroglyphs), then carvings in volcanic rock would qualify. So if a candidate has a carving in volcanic rock for a non-tool purpose, that would score high. But none of the candidates do that except maybe none.

Candidate 2 is a carving (adze) in volcanic rock, but it's a tool. So similar to the anti-example arrowheads (obsidian tools). So score 1.

Candidate 3's cave paintings are on rock, but not carved, so 0.

Thus, the only score is 2.1, others 0.

Since the user insists on using the full range, I'll go with the following:

1. Limestone sculptures: 0 (non-volcanic, but form matches anti-example's carvings →0)

2. Obsidian adzes: 2 (volcanic material but tool form, similar to anti-example but volcanic →2)

3. Cave paintings:0

4. Wood:0

5. Hot springs:0

6. Eruptions:0

7. Jade:0

8. Marble statues:0 (non-volcanic but form matches → maybe 1?)

Wait, maybe the statues are a form match, so 1.

So adjusting:

8.1

Thus:

1.0

2.2

3.0

4.0

5.0

6.0

7.0

8.1

But still limited. Alternatively, maybe candidate 5 (volcanic hot springs) gets a 1 because it's volcanic related but natural. But examples are human-made, so no.

Hmm. I think I have to proceed with the initial scores, even if they are mostly 0, with candidate 2 at 1 or 2.
