Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given examples and anti-examples, and I need to figure out the underlying theme from the examples and then evaluate each candidate based on that theme, making sure not to include the broader or related themes that the anti-examples might represent.

First, looking at the examples: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, Boyle's Law of Gas Pressure and Volume, and Huygens' Principle of Wavefronts. These all seem to be fundamental laws or principles in classical physics. Newton's law deals with gravitational force between masses, Boyle's relates pressure and volume of gases (part of the gas laws), and Huygens' principle describes how light propagates as wavefronts. They all are empirical or theoretical principles that describe a specific physical relationship in a straightforward, classical sense.

Now the anti-examples: Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, Bohr's Model of the Atom, and Schrödinger's Wave Equation. These are all from quantum mechanics or early atomic theory. They deal with more complex, probabilistic, or quantum phenomena. The key difference here is that the anti-examples are from quantum physics, while the examples are classical physics principles. The theme is likely classical physics laws/principles that are deterministic and deal with macroscopic phenomena, not quantum.

So the task is to score each candidate based on how well they fit into that classical theme, excluding anything quantum or relativistic (though Einstein's theory is a bit tricky because relativity is a classical theory in some contexts, but maybe in this case, since Einstein's theory is more modern and the examples are all pre-20th century except maybe Maxwell's? Wait, Maxwell's Equations are also 19th century, so maybe the cutoff is pre-quantum era.

Looking at the candidates:

1. Ohm's Law of Electrical Resistance: This is a classical law relating voltage, current, and resistance. Definitely a fundamental law in classical electromagnetism. Should be a high score, maybe 8 or 9? But wait, the examples include Huygens' principle (wave theory), Boyle's law (gas), Newton's gravity. Ohm's Law is similar in being a foundational law in its domain, so maybe 9? Wait, but the examples are all from different areas (gravity, gas, waves). Ohm's is another area (electricity), so it fits the theme. But let's see others first.

2. Avogadro's Law of Gas Volumes: This is another gas law, like Boyle's. So directly similar to an example. Should be a 10? But maybe not because the examples include Huygens and Newton's gravitation. But Avogadro's is a gas law, same category as Boyle's. So maybe 10? Or maybe 9? Hmm.

3. Maxwell's Equations of Electromagnetism: These are four equations that form the foundation of classical electromagnetism. They were developed in the 19th century, so pre-quantum. However, Maxwell's equations are more comprehensive and form a complete theory, not just a single law or principle. The examples are individual laws (Boyle, Newton's gravitation) and a principle (Huygens). Maxwell's Equations are a set of equations, so maybe slightly different in form but still part of classical physics. Maybe 8? Or perhaps 7? Because they are a set rather than a single law/principle?

4. Hooke's Law of Elasticity: This is F = -kx, a fundamental law in classical mechanics for springs. Definitely a classical law, similar to Boyle's and Newton's. So maybe 9 or 10?

5. Planck's Law of Black Body Radiation: This was Planck's contribution to quantum theory, introducing quantized energy. This is a quantum concept, so it's an anti-example. The anti-examples include quantum things. So this would be a 0? But Planck's law is a formula, so maybe some might think it's classical, but since it's the basis of quantum theory, it's definitely in the quantum realm. So 0 or 1?

6. Newton's Laws of Motion: The three laws of motion, which are fundamental to classical mechanics. The examples include Newton's gravitation law, so Newton's laws of motion are part of the same classical framework. So this should be a 10? But the examples have individual laws (Boyle, Newton's gravity) and a principle (Huygens). Newton's laws are three separate laws, but they're all part of classical physics. Maybe 10.

7. Einstein's Theory of Relativity: This is a modern theory, part of 20th-century physics. While it's classical in the sense that it's not quantum, it's a major shift from classical Newtonian physics. The examples are all pre-relativity. So this might be considered outside the theme. The anti-examples include quantum, but relativity is a different branch. So maybe 0? Or perhaps 3? Since it's still physics, but not the same as the examples which are more basic laws/principles in classical domains like gravity, gases, waves.

8. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction: Part of classical electromagnetism, leading up to Maxwell's equations. Faraday's law is a fundamental principle in electromagnetism, so similar to Huygens' principle. Should be a high score, maybe 9 or 10? Since Faraday's law is a foundational principle in EM, like Huygens for waves.

Now, let's assign scores with the above considerations:

1. Ohm's Law: 9 (fundamental classical law in electricity)
2. Avogadro's Law: 10 (directly similar to Boyle's law, same category)
3. Maxwell's Equations: 8 (a set of equations, but still classical EM)
4. Hooke's Law: 10 (basic classical mechanics law, like Newton's gravitation)
5. Planck's Law: 0 (quantum basis)
6. Newton's Laws of Motion: 10 (core classical mechanics, same author as one example)
7. Einstein's Theory: 2 (modern, beyond classical examples)
8. Faraday's Law: 9 (principle in EM, like Huygens)

Wait, but the user said to use the full range, so maybe adjust some. For example, Maxwell's Equations might be considered a higher score. Let me check again:

Wait, the examples include Huygens' Principle, which is a principle explaining wave propagation. Faraday's Law is a law in electromagnetism, so similar in status. Hooke's Law is a law, so maybe 10. Avogadro's is a gas law, so 10. Newton's Laws (plural) of Motion are three laws, so maybe similar to Boyle's as individual laws. So Newton's laws would be 10. Maxwell's Equations are a set, so maybe 8. Ohm's Law is a single law, so 9.

Einstein's Theory is definitely a theory, not a law or principle, and it's relativistic. So 1 or 2. Planck's is 0. 

Wait, the anti-examples include Heisenberg (quantum), Bohr (quantum model), Schrödinger (quantum). So Planck is definitely in the quantum realm, so 0. 

Einstein's relativity is a different category (modern physics, not quantum but not classical in the same sense as the examples). So maybe 1 or 2. 

Faraday's Law is part of classical electromagnetism, so 9. 

Maxwell's Equations are the foundation of classical EM, so maybe 9? But since they're a set, maybe 8. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The examples are individual laws or principles. Maxwell's Equations are four equations, so a bit different in form, but still part of the same classical framework. So perhaps 8. 

Hooke's is a law, so 10. 

Ohm's is a law, so 9. 

So the scores would be:

1. Ohm's Law: 9
2. Avogadro's: 10
3. Maxwell's: 8
4. Hooke's: 10
5. Planck's: 0
6. Newton's Laws of Motion: 10 (since they are fundamental classical laws, even though plural)
7. Einstein: 2
8. Faraday's: 9

Wait, but the user said "Newton's Laws of Motion" – the examples include "Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation", which is one of his laws (the law of gravitation). His three laws of motion are separate, so maybe they should be considered as a set. But the examples include individual laws. So maybe Newton's Laws of Motion as a group would be considered as a higher level than a single law, so perhaps 9 instead of 10? Because the examples are individual laws (Boyle, Newton's gravity), but Newton's laws of motion are three separate laws. Maybe that's a bit different, so 9? But the user might consider them as a core classical contribution. Hmm. Alternatively, since they are fundamental and Newtonian, maybe 10. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the examples are all specific principles or laws, not a set of laws. So Newton's laws of motion being three laws might be a set, so maybe 8. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since they are foundational, maybe 10. 

Similarly, Maxwell's Equations are a set of four equations, so maybe 8. 

Proceeding with the initial thought:

1. Ohm's:9
2. Avogadro:10
3. Maxwell:8
4. Hooke:10
5. Planck:0
6. Newton's Laws of Motion:10
7. Einstein:2
8. Faraday:9

But let me check again for consistency. 

Another angle: The examples are all specific to a particular phenomenon (gravitation, gas pressure/volume, wavefronts). The anti-examples are more comprehensive or theoretical (Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental quantum limit, Bohr's model is a model of the atom, Schrödinger's equation is a fundamental equation in QM). So candidates that are single laws/principles explaining specific phenomena would score higher.

Ohm's is a single law for resistance. Avogadro's for gas volume. Hooke's for elasticity. These are all specific. Newton's Laws of Motion are three laws, but each is a specific law (e.g., F=ma, etc.). So maybe they are considered as three individual laws, so collectively they can be considered as high. 

Maxwell's Equations are four equations that together form a theory, so maybe they're a step above, so 8.

Faraday's Law is a single law, so 9? 

Einstein's theory is a whole framework, so lower.

Planck's is quantum, so 0.

So I think the scores as I have them are okay. Let me just list them again:

1. Ohm's Law of Electrical Resistance → 9
2. Avogadro's Law of Gas Volumes →10
3. Maxwell's Equations of Electromagnetism →8
4. Hooke's Law of Elasticity →10
5. Planck's Law of Black Body Radiation →0
6. Newton's Laws of Motion →10
7. Einstein's Theory of Relativity →2
8. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction →9
