Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are:

1. Thermal imaging cameras first used for finding survivors in rubble, now used in medical screening.
2. Water purification tablets developed for tsunami relief, now used in laboratory sterilization.
3. Solar-powered blood centrifuges created for earthquake response, now used in remote clinics.

Looking at these, the common theme seems to be technologies or tools that were initially developed for disaster response or emergency situations but have since been adapted for non-emergency, everyday uses in other fields. The key points here are:

- **Original Purpose**: Disaster/emergency response (earthquakes, tsunamis, etc.)
- **Adapted Use**: A different, non-disaster-related application (medical screening, lab sterilization, remote clinics).

Now, the anti-examples are Rescue robots, Mobile field hospitals, Hurricane tracking systems. These don't fit the specific theme because:

- Rescue robots might still be used in disasters but perhaps not repurposed for a different field.
- Mobile field hospitals are still in the disaster/emergency context.
- Hurricane tracking systems are still used for disaster prediction, not repurposed elsewhere.

So the anti-examples stay within the disaster/emergency domain, whereas the theme requires a shift to a different application.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Radiation detectors**: Originally for detecting radiation (maybe in disasters like nuclear accidents?), but are they now used elsewhere? Maybe in medical imaging (like PET scans) or security? If so, that would fit. But if they're still used mainly in disaster contexts, then no. Not sure yet. Maybe a 5? But need to think more.

2. **Earthquake resistant buildings**: These are a structural solution for disasters. Their primary use is still in disaster prevention. They haven't been adapted to another field. So probably a 0 or low score.

3. **Emergency alert systems**: Designed for disasters, still used for alerts. No shift to another application. Anti-example-like. So maybe 0 or 1.

4. **Emergency radio beacons**: Used in emergencies (like shipwrecks, planes) to signal for help. Maybe now used in other contexts? Not sure. If they're still only for emergencies, then low score. Maybe 2?

5. **Water filtration systems**: The example had water purification tablets for labs. But water filtration systems in general might be used in both disaster and everyday contexts. But the key is if they were developed for disaster and then adapted. If the system was originally for disaster, now used elsewhere (like home filtration), then maybe. But maybe they are general tech. Not sure. Maybe 4?

6. **Tsunami warning buoys**: These are for disaster prevention, still used for that. So anti-example. 0.

7. **Seismographs**: Originally for earthquake monitoring, now maybe used in other geology research or engineering? But their main use is still in disaster detection. Maybe a 3?

8. **Portable ultrasound devices originally for disaster triage, now in routine diagnostics**: This directly matches the theme. Disaster use first, then adapted to routine medical use. So 10.

Now, adjusting scores based on how directly they fit:

1. Radiation detectors: If they were developed for disaster (like nuclear accidents) and now used in medicine, then maybe 7? But not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe they were first for medical and then disaster? Not sure. Need to assume based on common knowledge. Medical uses came first, so maybe not. Hmm. Maybe 4?

Wait, the examples are about moving from disaster to another field. So if radiation detectors were first for disasters (like Chernobyl cleanup), then adapted to medical imaging, that would fit. But I think medical uses came earlier. Maybe the other way around. So perhaps not. So maybe a 2?

Alternatively, if a specific type was developed for disaster and then moved, but generally, it's unclear. Maybe a 3?

2. Earthquake buildings: 0.

3. Emergency alerts: 0 or 1.

4. Radio beacons: 1 or 2.

5. Water filtration: Maybe 3? Since the example had purification tablets for labs, but filtration systems might be broader. If the system was designed for disaster and now used in households, maybe 5? Not sure. Maybe 4.

6. Tsunami buoys: 0.

7. Seismographs: 3, since maybe used in construction beyond just earthquakes.

8. Portable ultrasound: 10.

Wait, let me re-express each candidate:

1. Radiation detectors: Original purpose? Maybe in disasters like nuclear accidents. Then adapted to medical diagnostics (like checking for exposure?), or maybe in other fields like environmental monitoring. If the original was disaster response (like detecting radiation leaks) and now used in hospitals for patient monitoring, that would fit. But I'm not sure if that's the primary use. Alternatively, medical radiation detectors (like X-ray machines) were developed for medicine, so maybe not. Hmm. Maybe a 3 or 4.

2. Earthquake resistant buildings: Definitely 0, as their use is still in disaster prevention.

3. Emergency alert systems: 0, as they're still for emergencies.

4. Emergency radio beacons: Used in aviation or maritime disasters. If they were first for that and now used in other communication systems, maybe 2? Or still only for emergencies. Probably 1.

5. Water filtration systems: The example had purification tablets for labs. If the system was designed for disaster (like in refugee camps) and now used in households, then maybe 5. But maybe they're general tech. Maybe a 4.

6. Tsunami buoys: 0.

7. Seismographs: Originally for earthquake detection, but now used in other geophysical research, like oil exploration or studying tectonic plates. That's a shift to another field. So maybe 7? But the original was for disaster (earthquake detection), now used in non-disaster (oil, research). So that's a good fit. Wait, maybe 7?

Wait, the examples are about moving from disaster response to a different application. Seismographs are still used for disaster detection, but also in other fields. So maybe they are a 6 or 7?

Hmm, maybe 6?

8. Portable ultrasound: 10, as per the example structure.

So adjusting:

1. Radiation detectors: Maybe 3 (if uncertain but possible)

2. 0

3. 0

4. 1

5. 4

6. 0

7. 6

8. 10

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Let me check again.

Alternatively, for candidate 7, Seismographs: if they were developed for earthquake detection (disaster response) and now used in other fields like oil drilling, then that's a good fit. So maybe a 7.

Candidate 5: Water filtration systems. The example had purification tablets for labs. If the system was developed for disaster (like in refugee camps) and now used in households or other non-emergency water systems, then 5 or 6. But maybe it's too general. Maybe 4.

Candidate 1: Radiation detectors. If their original use was disaster (nuclear accidents) and now used in medical diagnostics (like PET scans), that would fit. But I think PET scans are medical from the start. Alternatively, maybe in environmental monitoring. If they started in disaster response, then maybe 5. But not sure. Maybe 3.

Alright, proceeding with these scores.
