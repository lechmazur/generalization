Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples and anti-examples. The examples are a shock absorber, a lava lamp, and a suspension bridge. The anti-examples are a brick foundation, a stone pillar, and a concrete wall.

Hmm, looking at the examples: a shock absorber is something that absorbs shocks, like in a car's suspension. A lava lamp has liquid that moves and changes shape. A suspension bridge uses cables to support the bridge deck, which has some flexibility. So maybe the theme is something related to flexibility, adaptability, or components that can change shape or support dynamically?

The anti-examples are more static structures. A brick foundation, stone pillar, and concrete wall are all rigid, fixed structures meant to provide solid support without much movement. So the theme isn't about structural support in general, but perhaps about elements that have some dynamic or fluid aspect.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Cement sidewalk: It's a solid structure, like the anti-examples. But maybe it's more rigid, so probably a low score.
2. Marble statue: Definitely static, made of hard material. Anti-example vibe, so low.
3. Waterbed: The water inside can shift, making it flexible. Similar to lava lamp's fluid movement. Maybe a good match.
4. Ice cube: It's solid but can melt. Not sure. Maybe if considering state changes? But ice itself is rigid. Hmm.
5. Steel beam: Rigid structural element, like the anti-examples. Probably low.
6. Wooden table: Solid, but wood can bend slightly. Maybe a bit more flexible than steel. But still more like anti-examples?
7. Metal pipe: Can be flexible (like hoses) but metal pipes are usually rigid. Unless it's a specific type. Maybe mid-range?
8. Glass window: Rigid, transparent. Definitely anti-example style. Low score.

Wait, let me re-examine the examples again. Shock absorber is about absorbing impact through compression. Lava lamp has fluid movement. Suspension bridge uses cables to allow some give. So maybe the theme is things that have a component which allows movement or flexibility as part of their function. So the key is that they have a part that can flex, move, or change form to serve their purpose.

Cement sidewalk: No, it's solid. Anti-example. 0-2?
Marble statue: Static, 0-2.
Waterbed: The water allows it to conform, so 8-10?
Ice cube: Unless it's melting, but as a solid, not. Maybe 1-3? Unless the theme includes things that can change state, but the examples don't have that.
Steel beam: Rigid, 0-2.
Wooden table: Maybe slightly flexible but not the main function. 3-5?
Metal pipe: If it's a rigid pipe, then low. Maybe 2-4. If flexible hose, but the question says metal, so probably rigid. 2.
Glass window: 0-2.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. The examples all have a dynamic element that's essential. Shock absorbers need to compress and rebound. Lava lamps rely on the wax moving. Suspension bridges use cables that flex under load. So the theme is items that have a dynamic, flexible component crucial to their function. Anti-examples are static support structures without such components.

Now, candidates:

1. Cement sidewalk: Static, no dynamic part. 0 or 1.
2. Marble statue: Static, 0.
3. Waterbed: The water allows movement, so 8 or 9.
4. Ice cube: Unless it's melting, but as an object, it's static. Maybe 1? Or 0 if it's just solid.
5. Steel beam: Static support, 0.
6. Wooden table: The wood can bend slightly, but it's not part of its function. Maybe 2? Or 1.
7. Metal pipe: Rigid, 0-1.
8. Glass window: Rigid, 0.

Wait, but the anti-examples include concrete walls, which are similar to cement sidewalk. So sidewalk is definitely an anti-example, so 0. Marble statue is similar to pillars, so 0. Ice cube might be a trick. Maybe it's a solid but can change state, but that's not part of the theme. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "things that can change shape or have a fluid component as part of their function." Then:

Waterbed (3) has fluid, so 9 or 10. Metal pipe: maybe not. Wooden table: no. Ice cube: if it's about melting, but that's not its function. So ice cube maybe 1. 

Let me assign scores:

1. Cement sidewalk: 0 (static, anti-example)
2. Marble statue: 0 (same)
3. Waterbed: 9 (fluid movement)
4. Ice cube: 1 (no function involving movement, just a solid)
5. Steel beam: 0
6. Wooden table: 2 (slight flexibility but not main function)
7. Metal pipe: 1 (if rigid, maybe 1)
8. Glass window: 0

Wait, maybe metal pipe can be flexible? Like a garden hose but metal? Not sure. Maybe 2. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "things that are designed to handle stress by flexing or moving". Then suspension bridge cables flex, shock absorbers compress, lava lamps move with heat. 

Waterbed's mattress flexes. So 8-9. 

Wooden table: the wood can flex a little but it's not designed for that. Maybe 3. 

Metal pipe: if it's part of a system that needs to handle pressure but rigid, maybe 1. 

Ice cube: 0. 

Cement sidewalk: 0. 

Glass window: 0. 

So adjusting:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 9
4. 1
5. 0
6. 3
7. 2
8. 0

But the user wants scores from 0-10 with more granularity. Let me check again. Maybe the wooden table's legs can bend, but it's not the main purpose. So 2 or 3. 

Metal pipe might be in a system where it can expand (like in plumbing with thermal expansion), but as an item itself, probably rigid. Maybe 1. 

Ice cube: maybe 1 because it can melt (change state), but not part of its function as an object. So 1. 

So final scores:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 9
4. 1
5. 0
6. 2
7. 1
8. 0

Wait, but the user's example scores included mid numbers. Maybe some need higher. Let me think again.

Suspension bridge uses cables which flex, so the theme is about flexibility in structure. 

Waterbed: 10? Maybe. 

Steel beam is like the anti-examples, so 0. 

Wooden table: maybe 3, as wood can flex a bit but not the main function. 

Metal pipe: if it's a rigid pipe, then 0, but maybe in some contexts it's part of a system that allows movement. Hmm. Maybe 2. 

Ice cube: maybe 0. 

Cement sidewalk: 0. 

Glass window: 0. 

Marble statue: 0. 

So:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 10
4. 0
5. 0
6. 3
7. 2
8. 0

But the user said not to use just 0s and 10s. So maybe waterbed is 9 instead of 10. 

Alternatively, maybe ice cube is 1 because it's a solid but can change state, but that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe a metal pipe can be part of a system that needs to flex, so 3. 

Hmm. Let me see the original examples again. 

Shock absorber (flexes), lava lamp (fluid movement), suspension bridge (flexible cables). So the key is that the object's functionality inherently involves movement or flexibility in some component. 

Waterbed: yes, so 9-10. 

Wooden table: the table's function doesn't rely on flexibility, so maybe 1 or 2. 

Metal pipe: unless it's a flexible metal hose, but as stated "metal pipe" is usually rigid. So 0-1. 

Ice cube: no. 

Cement sidewalk: 0. 

Glass window: 0. 

Marble statue: 0. 

So scores:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 9
4. 0
5. 0
6. 2
7. 1
8. 0

But the user wants all scores from 0-10. Let me think if any others might be in the middle. 

Wait, maybe the wooden table's legs can bend slightly when weight is applied, but it's not part of its design. So maybe 2. 

Metal pipe: maybe in some applications it can expand/contract, so 2. 

Ice cube: 1 because it can melt, but that's a state change not inherent function. 

So:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 9
4. 1
5. 0
6. 2
7. 2
8. 0

That uses more numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe the glass window can flex a little under pressure, but not really. So 0. 

Okay, I think this is as close as I can get.
