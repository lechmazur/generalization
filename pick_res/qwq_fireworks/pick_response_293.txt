Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given: frisbee, boomerang, javelin. The anti-examples are bow and arrow, catapult, trebuchet. So first, I should analyze what the common theme is among the first three and why the others don't fit.

Starting with the examples: frisbee, boomerang, javelin. All of these are objects that are thrown by hand, right? A frisbee is thrown and flies through the air, a boomerang is thrown and comes back (usually), and a javelin is a spear thrown in sports. They are all handheld throwing implements. 

Now the anti-examples: bow and arrow, catapult, trebuchet. These are devices or tools that launch projectiles but aren't thrown by hand. The bow and arrow uses a string to shoot an arrow, catapults and trebuchets are mechanical devices that launch objects with some kind of lever or sling. So the key difference here is that the examples are things you throw directly with your hand, while the anti-examples are devices that use some mechanism to launch something else.

So the specific theme is probably "hand-thrown objects that are projectiles themselves, not requiring a separate device to launch them." 

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Ballista: That's a large crossbow-like weapon. It uses a mechanism to shoot bolts, so similar to a catapult or trebuchet but more like a crossbow. Since it's a device, not a hand-thrown object, it's an anti-example. So probably a 0 or low score. 

2. Cannon: Definitely a device that fires projectiles using gunpowder. Not thrown by hand at all. So 0.

3. Rubber band: Hmm. A rubber band can be thrown by hand, like flicking it. But is that its primary use? Or is it more of an elastic tool? Maybe it's a borderline case. Maybe 2 or 3? But not sure.

4. Slingshot: Uses a pouch and rubber bands to shoot a projectile (like a stone). So the slingshot itself isn't the projectile; it's a device. So similar to the anti-examples. So probably low score, maybe 1 or 2.

5. Crossbow: Like a ballista but handheld. It shoots bolts, so again a device. So 0 or 1.

6. Discus: Oh, the discus is thrown in the Olympics, similar to a frisbee but more like a heavy plate. Definitely a hand-thrown object, so this should be a 10. Wait, but the original examples include javelin and frisbee, so discus is exactly like that. So 10.

7. Water balloon launcher: That's a device to launch water balloons, so like a catapult or slingshot. Not hand-thrown, so low score, maybe 0 or 1.

8. T-shirt cannon: Definitely a device that shoots t-shirts, so 0.

Wait, but let me check again. The user said the anti-examples can follow a broader theme. The key is to not match the broader theme. The specific theme is hand-thrown objects. So any device that launches something else is out. 

So for candidate 3, rubber band: if someone throws it by hand, like just tossing it, maybe, but it's not its primary function. So maybe a 2? Or maybe 1. Since it's not primarily a thrown projectile but can be. 

Slingshot (4) is a device, so 0. 

Discus (6) is a clear yes, so 10. 

Ballista (1) is a device, 0. 

Cannon (2) 0. 

Water balloon launcher (7) 0. 

T-shirt cannon (8) 0. 

Rubber band (3) maybe a 2? Or maybe 1? Because it's possible to throw it but not the main use. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The examples are all things that are thrown as the object itself. So javelin is the spear, frisbee is the disc, boomerang is the returning object. The anti-examples use a device to launch a separate projectile. 

So the key is that the object itself is the projectile, thrown by hand. So the candidates must be objects that are thrown as themselves. 

Rubber band: when you throw it, it's the rubber band itself that's the projectile, but is that common? Maybe sometimes, but not its primary purpose. So maybe a 3? 

Slingshot: the projectile is the stone, so the slingshot is the device. So 0. 

Discus: 10. 

Others like ballista, cannon, etc., are devices, so 0. 

Water balloon launcher: the projectile is the water balloon, so device, 0. 

T-shirt cannon: device, 0. 

Crossbow (5): device, so 0. 

So the scores would be:

1. Ballista: 0

2. Cannon: 0

3. Rubber band: maybe 2 or 3? 

4. Slingshot: 0

5. Crossbow: 0

6. Discus: 10

7. Water balloon launcher: 0

8. T-shirt cannon: 0

Wait, but maybe the rubber band can be considered as a projectile itself. If you flick it, it's the rubber band that's moving. So maybe a 3? 

Alternatively, maybe a 1 because it's not typically used that way. 

Hmm. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe the theme is "items that are thrown for sport or recreation and return or fly in a specific way". But frisbee, boomerang, javelin are all sports equipment. The anti-examples are devices used for launching. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "objects that are thrown by hand without needing a device". So any device that requires a mechanism to launch would be excluded. 

In that case, rubber band can be thrown by hand (even if not common), so maybe a 3. 

Slingshot is a device, so 0. 

Discus is 10. 

So the scores would be as follows:

1. Ballista - 0

2. Cannon - 0

3. Rubber band - 3

4. Slingshot - 0

5. Crossbow - 0

6. Discus - 10

7. Water balloon launcher - 0

8. T-shirt cannon - 0

Wait, but the user wants scores from 0 to 10, with granularity. So maybe for rubber band, 2? Or 1? 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is that they are all thrown in a way that they are aerodynamic or have a flight path. A rubber band when thrown might not fly far, but it's still thrown. Maybe 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is that they are all sports equipment used in competitions. Javelin and discus are Olympic, frisbee maybe in ultimate frisbee, boomerang in competitions. So discus is definitely in. 

Rubber band: not a sport, so maybe lower. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "objects designed to be thrown and return or have a specific flight path". Boomerang returns, frisbee flies straight, javelin goes far. 

Rubber band doesn't have that. So maybe 1. 

Hmm. Maybe I should go with 3 as a 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the rubber band to be a 0 because it's not typically thrown as a projectile. 

But the user's anti-examples are devices that launch projectiles. So if the rubber band is thrown by hand as the projectile itself, then it's a match. But if it's not typically used that way, maybe a low score. 

I think I'll go with 3 as a 2. 

So the final scores would be:

1. 0

2. 0

3. 2

4. 0

5. 0

6. 10

7. 0

8. 0

Wait, but let me check another angle. The anti-examples include bow and arrow, which is a device (bow) that launches an arrow. Similarly, crossbow is similar. So crossbow is an anti-example, so 0. 

Ballista is a big crossbow, so 0. 

Cannon is a device, so 0. 

Slingshot is a device, 0. 

Water balloon launcher and t-shirt cannon are devices, so 0. 

Rubber band: if you just throw it by hand, it's the object itself. So maybe a 3? 

Alternatively, maybe it's not considered a "throwing object" in the same sense. Maybe 1. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is that they are all thrown in sports. Then discus is 10, frisbee (sport), boomerang (sport), javelin. So other candidates: rubber band isn't a sport, so maybe 1. 

Hmm. I think I'll assign 2 to rubber band. 

So the scores are as above. Let me write them in the required format.
