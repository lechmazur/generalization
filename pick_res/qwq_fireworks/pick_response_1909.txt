Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples provided are a ride-sharing platform optimizing routes with live GPS, a warehouse system reallocating robots with real-time data, and a traffic management system adjusting signals based on live vehicle flow. So the common theme here seems to be systems that use real-time data to dynamically adjust their operations. They all involve automation and adaptability based on current information.

Now, the anti-examples are the opposite: manual, static, or fixed systems. Like the manual traffic lights with fixed intervals or static inventory systems. These don't adapt in real-time. So the key differentiator is real-time data-driven adaptability.

Now, evaluating each candidate:

1. Non-adaptive public transport timetable: Since it's non-adaptive, it's like the anti-examples. Timetables that don't change with real-time data. Probably a low score, maybe 1 or 2. But maybe a 3? Because maybe public transport could have some real-time elements, but the key word is "non-adaptive".

2. Manual resource allocation tool: Manual means no automation or real-time adjustment. So similar to anti-examples. Maybe a 1 or 2? But maybe a 2. Since it's project management, but it's manual, so definitely not using live data.

3. Standard recommendation system based on user history: It uses user history (past data), not real-time. But some systems might update in real-time? Wait, standard ones are based on past data. So like anti-examples, which are static. Maybe a 2? Or 3? Hmm. But recommendations can be dynamic if they update frequently, but "standard" here might mean it's not real-time. So probably low, like 2.

4. Smart grid with real-time consumption data: This fits the theme exactly. It's using real-time data to balance supply and demand dynamically. So that's a 10? Wait the examples all use real-time data for adjustments. So yes, this is a 10.

5. GPS app with static routes: Static means it doesn't adjust based on live data. Even though it's GPS, the routes are static. So like the anti-example of the static inventory. So maybe a 1? Or 0? But the GPS part is there but not used dynamically. So maybe 1.

6. Static pricing model: Definitely static, so similar to anti-examples. 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

7. Weather app using historical data: Not real-time, so like the anti-examples. So 0 or 1. Maybe 1? But historical vs live. The anti-examples have fixed timers or static systems, so this is similar. Maybe 0.

8. Basic thermostat with pre-set schedules: Exactly like the anti-example of the basic thermostat. So that's a 0. Wait the anti-examples included a basic thermostat with pre-set schedules? Wait the anti-examples listed were manual traffic lights, static inventory, traditional irrigation with fixed timers. The last one is similar to the thermostat. So the thermostat is like that, so 0.

Wait, let me check the anti-examples again. The anti-examples given were:

- Manual traffic light system with fixed intervals

- Static inventory management system

- Traditional irrigation with fixed timers

So the thermostat with pre-set schedules is similar to the fixed timer systems. So that's an anti-example. So it should be 0.

Now, let me recheck each candidate:

1. Non-adaptive timetable: 0 or 1. Since the examples all use real-time adaptation, non-adaptive would be 0, but maybe 1 because it's in the same domain (transport) but not adaptive. Hmm. The anti-examples include manual traffic lights, which are similar. So maybe 1.

Wait, the first example is a ride-sharing with live GPS. A non-adaptive timetable is the opposite. So 0?

Hmm, maybe 1 because it's a public transport system but not using real-time. The anti-examples include manual traffic lights (fixed intervals), so this is similar. So maybe 1.

2. Manual resource allocation: manual, so 0? But the anti-examples have manual traffic lights. So similar. Maybe 1? Or 0. Since the theme requires automation with real-time data. So manual is definitely 0. Hmm, maybe 1?

Wait the anti-examples include manual traffic light systems, which are 0. So manual resource allocation would be 0. Maybe.

3. Standard recommendation system: uses historical data, so like static inventory. So 1.

4. Smart grid: 10.

5. Static GPS routes: 1? Or 0? Since the first example is a ride-sharing that uses live GPS. The static version is the opposite. So maybe 1.

6. Static pricing: 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

7. Weather based on historical: 0.

8. Thermostat: 0.

Wait but the user said the scores should be 0-10, and use the full range. So maybe some of these can be higher?

Wait let me think again. The theme is systems that use live data to dynamically adjust. The anti-examples are all static or manual. So the candidates that are static or manual get 0 or low. Those that have some real-time but not exactly? Let's see:

Looking at candidate 3: standard recommendation system based on user history. If "standard" here means it's not real-time, but maybe it updates periodically, but not in real-time. So maybe a 2? Or maybe a 3? Hmm.

Candidate 5: GPS navigation with static routes. Even though GPS is a technology used in the examples, the key is that the route isn't adjusted in real-time. So maybe 1.

Candidate 7: weather using historical data. So no real-time input. So 0.

Wait, but maybe the weather app that uses historical data to predict might have some real-time aspects? Like, maybe it uses historical patterns but not current data. So it's not using live data. So 0.

So possible scores:

1. Non-adaptive timetable: 0 or 1. Let's say 1.

2. Manual resource allocation: 0.

3. Standard recommendation: 2.

4. Smart grid: 10.

5. Static GPS: 1.

6. Static pricing: 1.

7. Weather historical: 0.

8. Thermostat: 0.

Wait but the user wants a nuanced scale. Maybe some of these can be higher. Let me check again.

Wait candidate 3: standard recommendation system. Maybe some systems use real-time data, but the question says "standard" so it's the basic one. So 2.

Candidate 5: GPS navigation with static routes. The examples use live GPS for dynamic adjustments. So static routes would be 0? Or maybe 1 because GPS is involved but not used dynamically. Hmm, maybe 1.

Alternatively, if the GPS app uses live traffic data but gives static routes, but no, static routes are pre-set. So 1.

Candidate 3: maybe 2.

Now let's see if some candidates are closer but not exact. For example, a recommendation system that uses user history (past data) but not real-time, so it's static. So 2.

Candidate 7: weather based on historical data, so 0.

Candidate 8: 0.

So compiling:

1. 1

2. 0

3. 2

4.10

5.1

6.1

7.0

8.0

Wait but maybe some of these can be higher. Let me see the anti-examples are the worst, so maybe the scores can be from 0 to 10. Let me think again.

Wait candidate 3: a standard recommendation system. Maybe some recommendation systems do use real-time data, but the question specifies "based on user history", so it's not real-time. So it's like static inventory. So maybe 2.

Candidate 5: GPS app with static routes. The example uses live GPS data to optimize, so static routes are opposite. So 1.

Candidate 6: static pricing, which is like static inventory. So 1.

Hmm. Now, let me see if there's any candidate that might be a 3 or higher but not 10.

Wait candidate 7: weather app using historical data. If it's purely historical, then 0. But maybe it's using some aggregated data but not real-time. So 0.

Candidate 2: manual resource allocation. It's manual, so no automation. So 0.

Candidate 1: non-adaptive timetable. So no real-time adjustments. So 0 or 1. Let's say 1.

So final scores:

1. 1

2. 0

3. 2

4.10

5.1

6.1

7.0

8.0

Wait but the user wants to use the full range. Maybe I'm being too strict. Let me think again.

Wait candidate 3: standard recommendation system. Maybe it's better than 2. Suppose some systems use user history but in real-time. For example, if a user adds a movie to their list, the system updates recommendations immediately. But "standard" might mean it's based on past data without real-time updates. So maybe 2 is okay.

Alternatively, maybe a 3? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should adjust some scores to have a better spread. Let me see the examples again.

The examples all use real-time data for dynamic adjustments. The anti-examples are static or manual.

Now, for the candidates:

1. Non-adaptive timetable: it's not using real-time, so 0 or 1. Maybe 1.

2. Manual tool: 0.

3. Recommendation based on history: 2.

4. Smart grid (10).

5. Static GPS routes: 1.

6. Static pricing: 1.

7. Weather historical: 0.

8. Thermostat:0.

That's the same as before. But maybe some candidates can have higher scores?

Wait candidate 7: weather app using historical data. Maybe it's using some real-time data but primarily historical? No, the description says based on historical data. So 0.

Candidate 3: maybe 3 instead of 2? Hmm.

Alternatively, let's see:

What about the smart grid is 10. The next best might be something else? Let me check all candidates again.

Candidate 4 is clearly a 10.

Others are low. Maybe some candidates have some elements but not fully real-time.

Wait candidate 5: GPS navigation app that provides static routes. The first example uses live GPS for dynamic routes. The static one is opposite, so 1.

Candidate 3: maybe 2 is okay.

Alternatively, maybe candidate 7 could be 1 if it uses some minor real-time aspects but primarily historical.

Wait the anti-examples include traditional irrigation with fixed timers. The thermostat is similar, so 0.

Hmm. I think the scores are as above. But let me check again for any possible higher scores.

Wait candidate 7: weather app based on historical data. If it's predicting rain based on historical data, that's not real-time. So 0.

Candidate 3: standard recommendation. Maybe 2 is okay.

So the scores would be:

1.1

2.0

3.2

4.10

5.1

6.1

7.0

8.0

But the user wants a range from 0-10, so maybe some need to be higher. Let me see if there's any candidate that could be a 3 or 4.

Looking again at the candidates:

Candidate 7: 0.

Candidate 3: 2.

Candidate 5:1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the recommendation system could be a 3? Or maybe a GPS app that uses static routes but has some real-time features? No, the description says static.

Alternatively, maybe the thermostat is 0, others are as before.

Alternatively, maybe the static pricing model (6) is a 2? Hmm, but it's static like the anti-examples. So maybe 1.

Hmm. I think the scores are as I had before. Let me proceed with that.
