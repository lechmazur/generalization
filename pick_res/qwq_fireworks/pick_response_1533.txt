Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to figure out the specific theme that distinguishes them. The examples are:

- Kayas of the Mijikenda, Kenya
- Ficus Sacred Grove, India
- Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove, Nigeria

The anti-examples are Jerusalem, Mecca, and Vatican City. 

First, I'll analyze the examples. All three are named as "Sacred Groves" or similar, which suggests they are natural or forested areas considered sacred by indigenous or local communities. The Mijikenda Kayas are forests with cultural and spiritual significance. The Ficus Sacred Grove in India is a specific type of sacred grove tied to Hindu traditions, and Osun-Osogbo is a sacred grove associated with Yoruba religion in Nigeria. 

Now the anti-examples: Jerusalem, Mecca, Vatican City. These are major religious cities or sites, centers of global religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism). They are urban centers with significant religious architecture like churches, mosques, and temples, not natural sacred groves. The key difference here seems to be that the examples are natural sites (forests, groves) with indigenous or local spiritual significance, whereas the anti-examples are urban religious centers of major world religions.

So the specific theme is likely "Sacred natural sites (like groves or forests) with indigenous or local cultural/religious significance, not urban centers of major world religions."

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Mount Olympus, Greece**: A mountain known in Greek mythology as the home of the gods. It's a natural site with spiritual significance. But it's a mountain, not a grove. However, it's a natural sacred site tied to local mythology. Maybe a 7 or 8? Wait, but the examples are all groves. Maybe it's a bit less of a direct match. Let's see others first.

2. **Machu Picchu, Peru**: An Incan archaeological site, a city. It's a cultural site, but it's a constructed place, not a natural grove. So it might be an anti-example because it's a man-made structure, even if sacred. Maybe a 3 or 4?

3. **Notre-Dame Cathedral, France**: Definitely a major Christian cathedral, so it's an urban religious site. This is an anti-example. So score 0 or 1?

4. **Chichen Itza, Mexico**: Another archaeological site, a Mayan pyramid. Again, a constructed temple, so similar to Machu Picchu. So maybe 2?

5. **Angkor Wat, Cambodia**: A temple complex, again a major religious site of Hindu/Buddhist faith, but man-made. So like the anti-examples. Score low, maybe 1?

6. **Hawaiian Sacred Groves, Hawaii**: The name includes "Sacred Groves," which matches the examples exactly. This is likely a 10, but wait, check if it's a natural forest. Hawaiian sacred groves would be similar to the examples. So probably a 10. But let me confirm if they are actual groves. Yes, Hawaiian traditions do have sacred groves like wao akua. So 10?

7. **Mount Fuji, Japan**: A mountain considered sacred in Shinto and Buddhism. It's a natural site, but not a grove. However, it's a significant natural sacred site. Maybe similar to Mount Olympus. Maybe 8?

8. **Uluru, Australia**: Also known as Ayers Rock, a sacred site for Indigenous Australians. It's a rock formation, not a grove, but a natural site with deep cultural significance. So similar to Mount Olympus or Fuji. Maybe 9? Wait, but the examples are groves. Since Uluru is a rock, maybe slightly lower. Maybe 7?

Wait, need to ensure that the theme is specifically about groves or forested areas. The examples are all groves. So if the candidate isn't a grove, it might score lower even if it's a natural sacred site. Let's reassess:

- Hawaiian Sacred Groves (6) are exactly groves. So 10.

- Mount Olympus (1): mountain, not a grove. Maybe 6? Since it's a natural sacred site but not a grove. The examples are all groves.

- Machu Picchu (2): constructed, so lower. Maybe 2.

- Notre-Dame (3): 0.

- Chichen Itza (4): 1.

- Angkor Wat (5): 1.

- Mount Fuji (7): natural site but not a grove. Maybe 5?

- Uluru (8): natural but rock. Maybe 4?

Wait, maybe I need to be more precise. The theme is specifically "sacred groves" or similar forested areas. So the key elements are:

1. Natural (not man-made structures)

2. Specifically a grove/forest area

3. Indigenous/local cultural significance, not a major world religion's central site.

So:

- Hawaiian Sacred Groves (6): 10, perfect match.

- Mount Olympus (1): Natural site, sacred, but not a grove. So maybe 7? Because it's a mountain, but still a natural sacred site. But since the examples are groves, maybe lower. Maybe 6?

- Machu Picchu (2): archaeological site (man-made), so 0 or 1.

- Notre-Dame (3): definitely 0.

- Chichen Itza (4): 0 or 1.

- Angkor Wat (5): 0 or 1.

- Mount Fuji (7): Natural, sacred, but not a grove. Maybe 5?

- Uluru (8): Natural, sacred, but a rock. Maybe 4?

Wait, but the anti-examples are cities or central religious sites. So if a place is a natural site but not a grove, like a mountain or rock, it's still closer than the anti-examples. So maybe:

Mount Olympus (1): 7 (natural, sacred, but not a grove)

Uluru (8): 6 (rock, but natural sacred site)

Mount Fuji (7): 6?

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are all "sacred groves" as in forested areas with specific indigenous protection. So:

- Hawaiian Sacred Groves: 10

- Uluru: not a grove, so maybe 4.

- Mount Olympus: 6 (sacred mountain, but not a grove)

- Machu Picchu: 0 (man-made)

- Others like Angkor Wat: 0

Wait, let me re-express the scores:

1. Mount Olympus: Natural sacred mountain. Since the examples are groves, maybe a 6 or 7.

2. Machu Picchu: 0 (man-made city)

3. Notre-Dame: 0 (church, urban)

4. Chichen Itza: 0 (temple)

5. Angkor Wat: 0 (temple complex)

6. Hawaiian Groves: 10

7. Mount Fuji: 7 (natural, sacred mountain, but not a grove)

8. Uluru: 5 (rock, but natural site with indigenous significance)

Wait, but maybe Uluru is considered a sacred grove? No, it's a sandstone monolith. So not a grove. So 5?

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "sacred natural sites of indigenous cultures", not necessarily groves. Let me check the examples again:

The examples are all "sacred groves" (forested areas), so the theme is specifically groves. So only the Hawaiian one is a direct match. The others that are natural but not groves would get lower scores.

So:

1. Mount Olympus: 5 (natural, sacred, but not a grove)

2. Machu Picchu: 0

3. Notre-Dame: 0

4. Chichen Itza: 0

5. Angkor Wat: 0

6. Hawaiian:10

7. Mount Fuji:5 (natural mountain)

8. Uluru: 4 (rock, not forest)

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "sacred natural sites with local/indigenous significance, not global religions". So Uluru and Mount Olympus would be better. Let's see:

Examples are all groves, which are natural sites. The anti-examples are cities of major religions. So the key is natural sites with local significance, not cities. So:

- Hawaiian:10

- Mount Olympus:7 (natural, sacred, local significance in Greek culture)

- Uluru:8 (very significant, natural)

- Mount Fuji:7 (sacred mountain in Shinto)

- Machu Picchu:5 (archaeological site, but not a natural grove. However, it's in a natural setting. Maybe 3?)

Wait, but the examples are groves. So perhaps only the Hawaiian is a 10. The others that are natural sites but not groves would be 5-7?

Alternatively, maybe "sacred groves" are a subset of natural sacred sites. So the theme is specifically groves. Therefore:

1. Mount Olympus: 3 (mountain, not grove)

2. Machu Picchu: 0

3. Notre-Dame:0

4. Chichen Itza:0

5. Angkor Wat:0

6. Hawaiian:10

7. Mount Fuji:3 (mountain)

8. Uluru:2 (rock)

Hmm, but maybe I'm being too strict. Let me think again. The examples are all "sacred groves" but the anti-examples are cities. So perhaps the theme is "sacred natural areas (like groves, mountains, etc.) with local/indigenous significance, not global religious centers". So the key is that they are natural and not man-made religious centers. So:

- Hawaiian:10 (grove, natural, indigenous)

- Mount Olympus:7 (natural, sacred mountain, local significance)

- Uluru:8 (natural, sacred rock, indigenous)

- Mount Fuji:6 (sacred mountain, Shinto/Buddhist, but Japan's national symbol. But is it indigenous? Yes, pre-Buddhism. So maybe 7?)

- Machu Picchu:5 (archaeological site, but built, so less. However, it's in a natural setting and sacred to Incas. Maybe 4?)

- Angkor Wat:0 (temple complex)

- Chichen Itza:0 (temple)

- Notre-Dame:0

Wait, but the user's anti-examples include Mecca, Vatican, Jerusalem, which are cities with religious significance. So any constructed religious sites (like temples, churches, etc.) are anti-examples. But natural sites, even if they have structures, might be okay. But Machu Picchu is a city ruin, so maybe it's more like an anti-example.

Alternatively, the theme is "sacred groves" specifically. So only the Hawaiian one is a 10. The others that are natural but not groves get lower scores.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "sacred natural sites protected by indigenous communities", which includes groves, mountains, etc. So then:

- Hawaiian:10

- Uluru:9 (indigenous, natural)

- Mount Olympus:7 (sacred mountain, but maybe more Greek mythology than indigenous community today?)

- Mount Fuji:7 (Shinto sacred mountain)

- Machu Picchu:5 (natural area with ruins, but not a grove)

- Angkor Wat:0 (temple)

- Chichen Itza:0

- Notre-Dame:0

Hmm, this is tricky. Since the user says the examples are the "specific theme", and the anti-examples are broader. The examples are all "groves", so maybe the theme is exactly "sacred groves". Therefore, only Hawaiian is a 10. Others that are natural but not groves would be lower. Let's try that approach:

1. Mount Olympus (mountain) → 3 (natural sacred site but not a grove)

2. Machu Picchu (archaeological site) → 0

3. Notre-Dame (church) →0

4. Chichen Itza (temple) →0

5. Angkor Wat (temple) →0

6. Hawaiian →10

7. Mount Fuji (mountain) →3

8. Uluru (rock) →2

But maybe the user expects some in the middle. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "sacred natural sites with indigenous significance", so groves are examples, but other natural sites like mountains also qualify. Then:

Hawaiian:10

Uluru:9

Mount Olympus:8

Mount Fuji:7

Machu Picchu:5 (since it's a city, but in a natural setting, maybe 4)

Wait, but Machu Picchu is a constructed city, so even if it's in the mountains, it's not a natural site. So maybe 2.

Alternatively, the examples are all "sacred groves", so the theme is specifically groves. Thus, only Hawaiian is a 10. The others that are natural but not groves get lower scores, like 3-5.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "sacred natural areas protected by local communities", which includes groves, mountains, etc. Then:

Hawaiian:10

Uluru:9

Mount Olympus:7

Mount Fuji:7

Machu Picchu:5 (since it's a ruin, but the area around it might be sacred)

Wait, but Machu Picchu is a constructed site, so even if the surrounding area is sacred, the site itself is man-made. So maybe 3.

This is quite a challenge. To resolve, I think the key is that the examples are all "groves", so the theme is "sacred groves". Therefore, only the Hawaiian Sacred Groves (6) is a 10. The other natural sites like mountains or rocks get lower scores (maybe 3-5). The constructed sites (Machu Picchu, temples) are 0-2. So final scores:

1. Mount Olympus:5 (natural, sacred, but not grove)

2. Machu Picchu:1 (archaeological site)

3. Notre-Dame:0

4. Chichen Itza:0

5. Angkor Wat:0

6. Hawaiian:10

7. Mount Fuji:5

8. Uluru:4 (rock, but natural and sacred)

Wait, maybe:

Mount Olympus and Fuji are both mountains, so maybe 6 each.

Uluru is a rock but very significant → 7?

Hmm. Alternatively:

Let me list them with the scores as I think now:

1. Mount Olympus, Greece → 6 (natural, sacred mountain, but not a grove)

2. Machu Picchu, Peru → 2 (archaeological site, man-made)

3. Notre-Dame Cathedral →0 (urban religious building)

4. Chichen Itza →1 (temple, man-made)

5. Angkor Wat →1 (temple complex)

6. Hawaiian Sacred Groves →10 (exact match)

7. Mount Fuji →7 (sacred mountain in Shinto, natural)

8. Uluru →8 (sacred rock, very significant to indigenous)

Wait, Uluru is a key site for Aboriginal Australians, so maybe higher than Fuji? Maybe 8, while Fuji 7.

Alternatively, since the examples are groves (forests), maybe Uluru is not a grove but still a natural sacred site, so 7?

Hmm. Alternatively, I'll proceed with these scores, even if there's uncertainty.
