Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided three examples: Keynesianism, Darwinism, Freudianism. These all seem to be "-isms" named after specific individuals, each representing a comprehensive theory or school of thought in their respective fields (economics, biology, psychology). The anti-examples are a philosophical school, a social movement, and a philosophical concept. These are broader categories or different types of entities.

So the specific theme here is likely theories or schools of thought named after a person, each being a systematic body of ideas in a academic or intellectual field. The anti-examples are categories that could include such "-isms" but are too broad or different (like a social movement isn't necessarily a named theory).

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. **A psychological disorder**: This is a medical/psychological condition, not a theory or school of thought. So probably low, maybe 0-2.
2. **A mathematical theorem**: A theorem is a proven statement, not a named school or theory. Maybe 1-3.
3. **A scientific method**: A method, not a named theory. Maybe 1-3.
4. **Marxism**: Definitely a "-ism" like the examples, named after Marx, a systematic theory. So high, like 9-10.
5. **A legal principle**: A principle in law, not a person-named theory. Maybe 0-2.
6. **A religious doctrine**: Could be part of a religion's teachings, but not necessarily a named school after a person. Maybe 2-4.
7. **A political party**: An organization, not a theory. Probably low, like 0-1.
8. **A historical figure**: Just a person, not a theory or school. Maybe 0-1.

Wait, but need to ensure they're not too broad. For example, Marxism is a direct match. Others like "a religious doctrine" might be broader but could sometimes be person-named (like Calvinism?), but the candidate here is general. So adjust accordingly. The anti-examples include "a philosophical school", so "Marxism" is a school but also a "-ism", so it's better to give it a 10? But the user said the anti-examples are not the exact theme. The theme is specifically the examples given, which are all "-isms" named after people. So Marxism is exactly like them. So 10. Let me check again.

Wait, the anti-examples include "a philosophical school", which could include Marxism (since Marxism is a school of thought). But the user says the anti-examples are not the exact theme. So the exact theme is the specific "-isms" named after individuals. So Marxism would be a 10. The others need to be compared. Let me recheck each candidate:

1. Psychological disorder: Not a theory, so 0 or 1. Maybe 1 because it's a named concept but not a theory.
2. Mathematical theorem: Not a named school, so 1.
3. Scientific method: A method, not a named theory. Maybe 2.
4. Marxism: 10.
5. Legal principle: 0.
6. Religious doctrine: If it's like "Calvinism", but the candidate is general. So maybe 2, but since it's a general category, not a specific named -ism, so 1.
7. Political party: 0.
8. Historical figure: 0.

Wait but the user wants scores from 0-10, so maybe need to spread more. Let me see:

Wait, the anti-examples include "a philosophical school". Since Marxism is a school, but the examples include it as a "-ism", so the theme is more about the "-ism" naming rather than being a school. So Marxism is a direct match. 

For "a religious doctrine", if the doctrine is named after a person (like Lutheranism), but the candidate is a category, so it's not specific. So maybe 1-2.

"Scientific method" is a procedure, not a named theory. Maybe 1.

"Political party" is an organization, 0.

"Psychological disorder" is a condition, 0.

"Legal principle" is a principle, 0.

"Mathematical theorem" is a theorem, so 1.

So:

1. 0

2. 1

3. 1

4. 10

5. 0

6. 1

7. 0

8. 0

Wait, but the user wants nuanced scores, not just 0 and 10. Maybe some are in between. For example, "religious doctrine" could be 2, "scientific method" 2. Let me think again. The theme is theories named after individuals. So "a religious doctrine" might sometimes be a named doctrine (like Calvinism, but that's a -ism too), but the candidate is the category, not an instance. So the category is a broader theme, so it's an anti-example. So maybe 1.

Similarly, "a scientific method" is a method, not a theory, so 1.

Wait, maybe "a philosophical concept" is an anti-example, which is broader. The examples are all -isms. So the candidates need to be similar to the examples. So "Marxism" is a 10. The others:

A psychological disorder is not a theory. 0.

Math theorem: 1 (since it's a named concept but not a theory).

Scientific method: 1 (method, not a theory).

Legal principle: 0.

Religious doctrine: 1 (if considered a set of ideas but not a named -ism).

Political party: 0.

Historical figure: 0.

Hmm. But maybe "a scientific method" like the scientific method is a general approach, so 0? Or maybe 1 because it's a systematic approach but not named after a person. 

Alternatively, maybe "a mathematical theorem" like Pythagoras' theorem is named, but the candidate is the category. So the category is not a match, so 1.

I think that's the best I can do. Let's assign the scores accordingly.
