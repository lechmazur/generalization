Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples are police car lights, day and night illustration, and Yin and Yang symbol. Let me think about what these have in common.

Police car lights are typically flashing red and blue lights. Day and night illustration would show the transition or contrast between day and night. The Yin and Yang symbol is all about duality, balancing two opposing forces. So, the common theme here seems to be duality or contrast between two opposing elements. Each example pairs two contrasting elements: light and dark (day/night, Yin/Yang), colors (red/blue in police lights), etc.

Now, the anti-examples are kaleidoscope, tartan plaid, and zebra. Let's see why they don't fit the specific theme. A kaleidoscope has multiple colors and patterns, but they aren't necessarily two opposing elements. Tartan plaid is a pattern with multiple stripes and colors, again more than two and not necessarily contrasting in a dualistic sense. A zebra has black and white stripes, which might seem like duality, but maybe the theme here is more about strict alternation or stripes rather than symbolic opposition. The anti-examples might involve more elements or a different kind of contrast, so the specific theme is stricter: exactly two opposing elements in balance or contrast.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. Camouflage pattern: This usually blends multiple colors to mimic an environment. It's not two clear opposing elements but a mix. So maybe low score, like 2 or 3.

2. Butterfly wing: Some butterflies have symmetrical patterns, others have contrasting colors. If it's about two colors in opposition, maybe a 5 or 6? But some wings have more than two colors or complex patterns. Not sure yet.

3. Mosaic: This is a collection of small pieces, often many colors and elements. Unless it's a two-color mosaic, but generally more varied. Probably low, like 1 or 2.

4. Rubik's Cube: Multiple colors, each face a different color. Not two opposing ones. Maybe 0 or 1.

5. Patchwork quilt: Made of many different fabrics and colors. Again, multiple elements, so low, maybe 1 or 2.

6. Chessboard: Black and white squares in a grid. Exactly two colors in strict alternation. That's very close to the theme. Probably high, like 8 or 9.

7. Stained glass window: Can have many colors and designs. Unless it's specifically two colors, but generally more. Maybe 3 or 4.

8. Traffic light: Typically three colors (red, yellow, green). So three elements, which is more than two. So maybe 2 or 3.

Wait, but the examples include police lights (two colors), day/night (two), Yin/Yang (two). So the key is exactly two opposing elements. So Chessboard is perfect. Traffic light has three, so worse. Butterfly wings might have two colors (like some species have mainly black and white), so maybe 6 or 7. Let me think again.

Camouflage: Not two, so 1. Butterfly: If the wing has two contrasting colors in a pattern, maybe 6. Mosaic: 1. Rubik's: 0. Patchwork:1. Chessboard:9. Stained glass: maybe 3 if it's multiple colors, but if sometimes two, maybe 4. Traffic light:2. Hmm. Let me adjust:

Chessboard is 9. Traffic light is 2 (three colors, so not matching). Butterfly wing: if it's like the Monarch has orange and black, maybe that's two, so 7. Stained glass could have two dominant colors but often more, so 4. Camo: 1. Mosaic:1. Rubik's:0. Patchwork:1. That seems better. Let me check the anti-examples again. Zebra is black and white but is an anti-example. Wait, the anti-examples include zebra, which is two colors. So why is zebra an anti-example? Maybe because the theme requires a symbolic or balanced duality rather than just stripes? The Yin and Yang is about balance, police lights are functional with two colors, day/night is a natural cycle. Zebra's stripes might be seen as just a pattern without the symbolic opposition. So maybe the theme requires the two elements to be in harmony or balance, not just any two contrasting. So the butterfly's wings might not be in opposition but part of a natural pattern. Hmm, this complicates. Alternatively, maybe the anti-examples are because they have more than two elements (kaleidoscope, tartan) or the zebra's stripes are a continuous pattern rather than two separate entities. So Chessboard is two colors in strict alternation, like Yin/Yang. Traffic light is three, so no. Butterfly wings might have two colors but arranged in a pattern, not as opposing forces. So maybe the score for butterfly is 5? Let me try again.

1. Camouflage: multiple colors, 0 or 1.

2. Butterfly wing: if it's two colors but arranged in a non-symbolic way, maybe 4.

3. Mosaic: many pieces, 0.

4. Rubik's cube: multiple colors, 0.

5. Patchwork: many, 0.

6. Chessboard: 10? But original examples had 10? Wait the original examples are police lights (red/blue), day/night, Yin/Yang. Chessboard is exactly two, so maybe 9 or 10. But the user said to use 0-10, so maybe 9.

7. Stained glass: if it's two colors, but usually more, so 3.

8. Traffic light: 2.

Wait, the anti-example zebra is two colors but is excluded. So maybe the theme requires the two elements to be in a more balanced or symbolic way. The zebra's stripes are just a pattern, not a duality like day and night. So Chessboard is a better example. So Chessboard would be 9. Butterfly maybe 6. Stained glass with two colors could be 5, but if it's more, then lower. Traffic light is three, so 2. Let me assign:

1. Camouflage pattern → 1 (multiple colors)

2. Butterfly wing → 6 (two colors but maybe not symbolic opposition)

3. Mosaic → 1 (many pieces)

4. Rubik's cube → 0 (many colors)

5. Patchwork quilt → 1 (many pieces)

6. Chessboard → 9 (two colors, strict alternation)

7. Stained glass → 4 (often multiple colors, but could have two in some cases)

8. Traffic light → 2 (three colors)
