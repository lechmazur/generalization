Okay, let's see. The user has given me three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to figure out the specific theme they're pointing at. The examples are Quilliq, soapstone lamps, and seal oil lamps. The anti-examples are electric heater, kerosene lamp, and wood stove.

First, I'll analyze the examples. Quilliq is an Inuit oil lamp traditionally made from soapstone, right? Soapstone lamps and seal oil lamps also seem to be related to traditional, maybe indigenous, methods of lighting or heating using oil as a fuel source. They all seem to be traditional, perhaps Arctic or cold climate tools, using natural materials and oils like seal oil. 

Now the anti-examples: electric heater uses electricity, which is modern. Kerosene lamp uses kerosene, which is a different fuel, maybe more modern or industrial. Wood stove burns wood, which is a different fuel type and structure. So the key differences might be the fuel type (oil vs. other fuels) and the traditional, specific cultural context (like Inuit or indigenous use). 

So the specific theme might be traditional oil lamps used by Arctic peoples, specifically using animal oils like seal oil, made from soapstone. The anti-examples use different fuels (electricity, kerosene, wood) or are more modern heating methods.

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Propane torch: Uses propane, which is a modern fuel. Not traditional, so probably a low score. Maybe 2 or 3.
2. Central heating: Definitely modern, uses various fuels but part of a system. Not a lamp or traditional, so 0 or 1.
3. Campfire: Open fire, uses wood. Not a lamp, so not matching. Maybe 1 or 2.
4. Driftwood fires: Similar to campfire, using driftwood. Still open fire, not a lamp. 1 or 2.
5. Torch: A handheld flame, but fuel could vary. If it's like a traditional torch with oil, maybe higher? But the examples are lamps. Maybe a torch is a bit different. Maybe 3?
6. Fireplace: Uses wood, part of a building. Not a lamp, traditional but fuel is wrong. 1 or 2.
7. Candle: Uses wax, which is a type of oil maybe? Wait, candles are typically wax, not animal oil. So maybe a 4? Since it's a flame in a container but not the right fuel.
8. Bonfire: Again, open fire, wood. 0 or 1.

Wait, but the examples are all lamps. So maybe the theme is specifically oil lamps, made from certain materials, using animal oil. So candidates need to be lamps using oil, possibly traditional. 

So revising:

1. Propane torch: Not a lamp, fuel wrong. 0-2.
2. Central heating: Not a lamp, modern. 0.
3. Campfire: Not a lamp, fuel wrong. 0-1.
4. Driftwood fires: Same as campfire. 0-1.
5. Torch: Not a lamp, but maybe a handheld flame. Maybe 1-2.
6. Fireplace: Not a lamp. 0.
7. Candle: A type of lamp (container with fuel), but wax instead of seal oil. Maybe 4-5? Since it's closer in form but fuel is different.
8. Bonfire: 0.

Hmm, but the examples include seal oil lamps, which are a type of lamp using seal oil. Soapstone lamps might be the containers. So maybe the key points are: lamps, using animal oil (seal), made from soapstone or similar traditional material. 

Candle uses wax (a plant or animal product?), but not seal oil. So maybe candles are a step closer but still not exact. The anti-example kerosene lamp uses kerosene, which is a mineral oil, so not the same as seal oil. So candles might be a 3? 

Wait, the anti-examples include kerosene lamp, so even if it's a lamp, if the fuel is not animal oil, it's an anti-example. So candles (wax) would be similar to kerosene in being non-animal oil, so they should be anti. But candle isn't an anti-example given. Hmm, maybe the theme is more about traditional Inuit items. So Quilliq is specifically Inuit. So maybe the theme is Inuit traditional lamps (Quilliq) made of soapstone and using seal oil. So other traditional lamps from other cultures might be closer, but if the candidate isn't from that specific context, it's lower.

Looking at the candidates again:

- Campfire and driftwood fires are open flames, not lamps. So 0-1.
- Torch: open flame, not a lamp. Maybe 1.
- Fireplace: not a lamp. 0.
- Propane torch: modern, 0.
- Candle: a lamp but not using seal oil. Maybe 2-3? Since it's a lamp but wrong fuel.
- Bonfire: 0.
- Wait, maybe the key is that the examples are all specific types of lamps used by a particular culture, so unless the candidate is a traditional lamp from that culture, it's lower. But since I don't have cultural context in the candidates, maybe focus on the fuel and form.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is traditional oil lamps in general, not necessarily Inuit. But the anti-examples include kerosene (which is an oil) so maybe animal-based oil vs mineral. The examples use seal oil (animal) so the theme is animal oil lamps. Then candles (wax is animal or plant) might be a 4 if using animal fat (like tallow candles), but modern candles are often paraffin (mineral). So maybe candles could be a 3 if uncertain.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that all examples are made from soapstone or similar materials. The Quilliq is soapstone. So material is part of the theme. Then the candidates need to be made of soapstone or similar traditional material? But the candidates don't mention materials. Hmm.

This is tricky. Since the user says not to state the theme, but I have to infer based on examples and anti-examples. The key differences are:

- Examples are all lamps, using oil (seal oil), made from soapstone (a specific material). 
- Anti-examples include non-lamps (electric heater, wood stove) and lamps with different fuels (kerosene).

Therefore the specific theme is: traditional oil lamps made from soapstone and using seal oil. 

Thus, candidates must be lamps, using animal oil, made from soapstone. Since the candidates don't specify materials except maybe none, except maybe "soapstone lamps" was an example, so if a candidate is a lamp made of soapstone, but the problem is the candidates don't have material info. 

Wait, the examples are Quilliq (which is a soapstone lamp with seal oil), soapstone lamps (explicit), and seal oil lamps. So the theme combines both the material (soapstone) and the fuel (seal oil), and the form (lamp). 

Therefore, the theme is "traditional lamps made of soapstone and fueled by seal oil". 

Now the candidates:

1. Propane torch: not a lamp, not soapstone, uses propane. 0
2. Central heating: not a lamp. 0
3. Campfire: open fire, not a lamp. 0
4. Driftwood fires: same as campfire. 0
5. Torch: handheld flame, not a lamp. 0-1
6. Fireplace: uses wood, not a lamp. 0
7. Candle: lamp, but fuel is wax (unless it's a tallow candle, but generally not seal oil). Material not soapstone. Maybe 1-2. But since seal oil is specific, maybe 2?
8. Bonfire: open fire. 0

Wait, but maybe the theme is just "oil lamps using animal fat", so seal oil is animal. Candles made from tallow (animal fat) would be closer. But modern candles are often paraffin. However, without knowing, maybe candle gets a 3? 

Alternatively, if the theme is specifically seal oil lamps (regardless of material), then any lamp using seal oil would be a 10. But the examples include soapstone lamps, so material is part of it. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "traditional Inuit heating/lighting devices using seal oil in soapstone containers". So only those exact items. Then all candidates except maybe none would be 0 except if there's a traditional Inuit lamp in the list, but there isn't. 

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the anti-examples. The user says the anti-examples can match a broader theme but not the exact. The examples are all lamps using oil (seal oil, soapstone lamps imply oil). The anti-examples include kerosene lamp (oil but different type), so the specific theme might be animal oil lamps (seal oil), made from traditional materials. 

Therefore, a candle (if using animal fat) might be a 4, but if it's paraffin (mineral), then lower. Since candles can be either, maybe average to 3. 

Torch: not a lamp, but if it's an open flame using oil, maybe like a seal oil torch? But the examples are lamps. So torch would be 1. 

Campfire and driftwood fires are open flames, not lamps. 0. 

Bonfire same as campfire. 0.

Propane torch is modern fuel, 0. 

Central heating is a system, 0. 

Fireplace uses wood, not oil. 0. 

So the scores would be:

1. Propane torch → 0
2. Central heating → 0
3. Campfire → 0
4. Driftwood fires → 0
5. Torch → 1
6. Fireplace → 0
7. Candle → 3 (if assuming some relation to oil lamps but wrong fuel)
8. Bonfire → 0

Wait, but maybe the candle is a closer match because it's a portable flame source, like a lamp, but not exactly. Since seal oil lamps are a type of lamp, candles are similar in form but different fuel. So maybe 3.

Alternatively, if the theme is strictly seal oil and soapstone, then candles are 0. But since the anti-examples include kerosene lamp (which is a lamp but wrong fuel), then candles (another wrong fuel) would also be anti. But since candle isn't in the anti-examples, maybe it's allowed to be a 2 or 3?

Hmm. The user said anti-examples are not part of the exact theme but could be part of a broader one. So candles might be a broader category (lamps using other oils) so they would be anti, but since they aren't listed as anti, maybe they can get a low score but not zero.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples are all traditional, non-modern, maybe Arctic. So candle is more general, but could be traditional. Maybe a candle made of tallow would be closer. So maybe 3.

Torch: not a lamp. 1.

So the scores as follows:

1. Propane torch: 0
2. Central heating: 0
3. Campfire: 0
4. Driftwood fires: 0
5. Torch: 1
6. Fireplace: 0
7. Candle: 3
8. Bonfire: 0

But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe I'm being too strict. Let me think again.

Another angle: the examples are all forms of lamps that use oil (seal oil) and are traditional. The anti-examples include other types of lamps (kerosene) or non-lamps (electric, wood stove). So the theme is "traditional oil lamps using animal-based oil (like seal oil)", so:

- Lamps using animal oil: higher score
- Non-lamps: 0
- Lamps using other fuels (like kerosene, propane, wax): lower but maybe some points if they're lamps.

Candle: if it's a wax candle, maybe 3. If it's a tallow candle (animal fat), maybe 5? But without knowing, maybe average to 3.

Torch: not a lamp, so 1.

So the scores would be:

1. Propane torch (not lamp, wrong fuel): 0
2. Central heating (not lamp): 0
3. Campfire (not lamp): 0
4. Driftwood fires (not lamp): 0
5. Torch (not lamp): 1
6. Fireplace (not lamp): 0
7. Candle (lamp but wrong fuel): 3
8. Bonfire (not lamp): 0

Alternatively, maybe the Quilliq is a specific type of lamp, so only exact matches would be 10, but since the candidates don't include that, maybe all are low except maybe none. But the user wants the full range, so perhaps I need to spread the scores more.

Wait, maybe "soapstone lamps" is an example, so any soapstone lamp would be 10, but the candidates don't have that. But the candidates include "soapstone lamps" as an example, so maybe "campfire" is unrelated, but "candle" is a type of lamp (container with fuel). So candles are a form of lamp, but with different fuel. 

Perhaps the scale should be:

- 10: exact match (like another traditional soapstone seal oil lamp, which isn't in the list)
- 7-9: lamps using animal oil but not soapstone
- 4-6: lamps using other oils (like kerosene is anti, so maybe candle is lower)
- 1-3: non-lamps but have some elements (like fire)
- 0: completely unrelated or anti-examples

But since candle is a lamp but wrong fuel, maybe 3-4.

Alternatively, the key is that all examples are specific to Inuit culture, so anything not from that culture would score lower. But without that info in candidates, maybe focus on fuel and form.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "traditional Arctic lamps using seal oil in soapstone containers". So only items that fit all three (traditional, Arctic, seal oil, soapstone) would be 10. Since none of the candidates do, the closest might be a candle (as a lamp but wrong fuel) or a torch (not a lamp). 

Alternatively, maybe "oil lamps" in general, but the anti-examples include kerosene (so non-animal oil). So the theme is animal oil lamps. Then candles made from tallow would be 7, but if they're paraffin, 0. Since candles can vary, maybe average to 3-4. 

Alternatively, since the examples are all using seal oil, which is a specific type of animal oil, maybe only seal oil lamps get top scores. So candles are lower.

Hmm. I think I need to make a decision here. Let me try to assign scores based on being a lamp, using oil (animal vs other), and traditional aspects.

1. Propane torch: Not a lamp, uses propane. 0
2. Central heating: System, not a lamp. 0
3. Campfire: Open fire, not a lamp. 0
4. Driftwood fires: Same as campfire. 0
5. Torch: Not a lamp, but handheld flame. Maybe 1 (slightly closer to a lamp's purpose but not a container)
6. Fireplace: Uses wood, not a lamp. 0
7. Candle: Lamp using wax (non-animal oil). Since the anti-example kerosene is a lamp but wrong fuel, candle is similar. Maybe 2.
8. Bonfire: Open fire. 0

Alternatively, maybe the candle is a 3 because it's a lamp, just different fuel. The torch as 1. The rest 0.

So the final scores would be:

1. 0
2. 0
3. 0
4. 0
5. 1
6. 0
7. 3
8. 0

But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe I need to find some candidates that are a bit better. Let me see again.

Wait, maybe "driftwood fires" could be considered as using natural materials like soapstone? No, it's just wood. Not a lamp.

What about "campfire" versus "bonfire"—both are open fires, so 0.

Torch: maybe a torch could be made with seal oil? Like a traditional torch used by Inuit? If so, maybe a 2 or 3. But without knowing, it's hard. 

Alternatively, the theme is "traditional oil lamps", so any traditional oil lamp would score higher. But candles can be traditional. So maybe candle is 5? Because it's a traditional lamp but wrong fuel. Whereas kerosene is an anti-example, so candle is better than that. Since the anti-examples include kerosene lamp (which is a lamp but with wrong fuel), maybe candle is slightly better? 

Alternatively, since candle is a different type of oil (wax vs seal oil), it's still off. Maybe 3.

Torch: 1.

So I think that's the best I can do. Assigning the scores as such.
