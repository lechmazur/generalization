Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the theme based on the examples and anti-examples given. The examples are Annie Lennox, Kate Bush, and Madonna. The anti-examples are Grace Jones, Debbie Harry, and Pat Benatar. 

First, I'll think about what these examples have in common. Annie Lennox is known for her distinctive voice and style, maybe her androgynous look in some of her work, like with Eurythmics. Kate Bush is a British singer known for her eccentric and theatrical performances, unique voice, and feminist themes. Madonna is the "Queen of Pop," known for reinventing herself constantly, pushing boundaries in music videos, and her influence on pop culture. 

Looking at the anti-examples: Grace Jones is also an androgynous performer with a strong stage presence, but maybe the theme isn't just about androgyny since she's an anti-example. Debbie Harry from Blondie has a strong persona but perhaps not the same level of genre experimentation or cultural impact as the examples. Pat Benatar is a rock singer with a strong voice but maybe not as avant-garde or as much reinvention as Madonna or Kate Bush.

Hmm, maybe the theme is more about being iconic female artists who have had a significant impact on pop music, with a focus on artistic reinvention, unique vocal styles, and perhaps a certain level of critical acclaim or longevity. Alternatively, maybe they are all British? Wait, Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are British, Madonna is American. So that's not it. 

Another angle: Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are known for more artistic, sometimes experimental music, while Madonna is pop but also very innovative. The anti-examples might be more in mainstream rock or R&B. Wait, Grace Jones is more new wave and funk, Debbie Harry is new wave, Pat Benatar is rock. 

Wait, maybe the common theme is that the examples are all known for their distinctive, sometimes avant-garde style, and have had long and varied careers with critical acclaim. Whereas the anti-examples, while successful, might be more associated with specific genres or eras. For instance, Pat Benatar is 80s rock, Debbie Harry with new wave, Grace Jones with 80s synth-pop but perhaps not the same level of reinvention. 

Let me think of the candidates now. 

1. Bonnie Tyler: She's known for "Total Eclipse of the Heart," but her career hasn't had as much reinvention as Madonna or Kate Bush. Maybe a 3 or 4?

2. Janet Jackson: She's a major pop icon, had several reinventions, especially with Rhythm Nation and later albums. That might fit closer to the examples. Maybe a 7 or 8?

3. Cher: She's had a very long career, with various reinventions (from folk to disco to pop, acting). Definitely a strong contender. Maybe 8 or 9?

4. David Bowie: Wait, he's male. The examples are all female. But the anti-examples include Grace Jones (female), Debbie Harry (female), Pat Benatar (female). So maybe gender isn't the theme. Wait, the anti-examples are all female too. So that's not it. So David Bowie might be an outlier here. Since the examples are all female, but the anti-examples are also female. Hmm, so maybe Bowie's not part of the theme. The theme might be female artists, but since the anti-examples are also female, that's not the case. So Bowie's inclusion here might be tricky. Since the original examples are all female, but the theme isn't gender, perhaps Bowie's a male artist, so he might get a 0? But I need to see if the theme is something else. Alternatively, maybe the theme is something like "female artists who are not just pop stars but have an artistic edge or avant-garde elements." David Bowie is definitely an artist with that, but he's male. Since the anti-examples are all female, maybe the theme isn't gender, so Bowie might score low because he's male, but I need to check the theme. Wait, maybe the theme is "female artists who have had significant influence in pop music with a focus on artistic reinvention and critical acclaim." Then Bowie wouldn't fit because he's male, so maybe 0 or 1. 

5. Stevie Nicks: Known as the "queen of hearts," part of Fleetwood Mac, solo career. She has a distinctive style and mystique, but maybe not as much reinvention as Madonna or Kate Bush. Maybe a 5 or 6?

6. Whitney Houston: Massive pop and R&B star, but her style was more traditional, less reinvention. Maybe a 2 or 3?

7. Cyndi Lauper: She had a big 80s pop hit, "Girls Just Want to Have Fun," and has a colorful persona. Maybe similar to Debbie Harry, but perhaps a bit more. Maybe a 5?

8. Tina Turner: Iconic, powerful performer, but her style is more consistent, rock and R&B, maybe not as avant-garde as Kate Bush. She's an anti-example? Wait, the anti-examples include Pat Benatar, who's similar. Tina Turner might be a 4 or 5, but since she's not an anti-example, maybe a 5?

Wait, let me reassess. The anti-examples are Grace Jones, Debbie Harry, Pat Benatar. So maybe the theme is something like "female artists who are not just pop icons but have a more artistic, experimental, or genre-blending approach." 

Annie Lennox (Eurythmics, more alternative/pop but also solo work), Kate Bush (avant-garde), Madonna (pop but experimental visuals and themes). 

Anti-examples are Grace Jones (new wave/funk but maybe seen as more genre-specific), Debbie Harry (new wave, but maybe not as experimental), Pat Benatar (rock, more straightforward).

So for the candidates:

Bonnie Tyler: She's a rock/pop singer with a strong voice but not known for reinvention. Maybe 3.

Janet Jackson: Definitely fits with reinvention and pop influence. 8.

Cher: Definitely fits with reinvention, long career, various styles. 9.

David Bowie: Male, so maybe not, but if the theme is artistic reinvention, he's a 10, but since the examples are female, perhaps the theme includes gender. Wait, but the anti-examples are also female. So maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "female artists who have been pioneers in their genres with significant cultural impact." Then Bowie would be excluded because male. So maybe 0 or 1.

Stevie Nicks: Has a unique style, mystical presence, but maybe not as much reinvention. 5.

Whitney Houston: Traditional pop/R&B, less experimental. 2.

Cyndi Lauper: She's pop but had a very unique style, maybe 6?

Tina Turner: Powerful performer, but maybe more in a consistent style. 4.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust. Let me think again. 

The examples are all women who have been influential, with a certain artistic edge beyond just mainstream pop. Madonna is pop but with a lot of reinvention. Kate Bush is more experimental. Annie Lennox as well. 

Anti-examples like Pat Benatar are rock but maybe not as genre-blending. Debbie Harry is new wave but maybe not as experimental. 

So for the candidates:

1. Bonnie Tyler: 3 (she's a rock balladeer, not much reinvention)
2. Janet Jackson: 8 (reinvented multiple times, pop icon)
3. Cher: 9 (reinvented constantly across genres)
4. David Bowie: 0 (gender, but if theme allows, maybe 7? But since all examples are female, maybe 0)
Wait, but the anti-examples include females, so gender isn't the filter. So maybe Bowie's score is based on his artistic reinvention. If the theme is about reinvention and artistic impact, then Bowie would be a 10, but the examples are female. Hmm, this is a problem. The user says the theme is specific, and the anti-examples are females who don't fit. Since Bowie is male, perhaps the theme is female artists with those traits, so he would get a 0. Alternatively, the theme might not consider gender, so Bowie would be a 10, but the examples are all female, so maybe the theme is gender-specific. The user's instruction says "specific theme" from the examples. Since all examples are female, the theme might include gender. But the anti-examples are also female, so that can't be. Therefore, the gender isn't part of the theme. So maybe Bowie's score is based on his own merits. 

Wait, the user says to not consider broader themes that the anti-examples might fit. The specific theme must be something that the examples share that the anti-examples don't, regardless of gender. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "British female artists who achieved significant international success with a unique artistic style." But Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are British, Madonna is American. So that's not it. 

Hmm, maybe the commonality is that they are all known for their distinctive vocal styles and have been influential in the music industry beyond just their music, like fashion, visuals, etc. Madonna's known for her visuals and reinvention. Kate Bush for her eccentric visuals and lyrics. Annie Lennox for her androgynous style and powerful vocals. 

The anti-examples: Grace Jones (also has a strong visual style but maybe more in a specific genre), Debbie Harry (visual style but maybe not as varied), Pat Benatar (strong vocals but less in visuals). 

So for David Bowie, he's known for visuals and reinvention, so he would fit that, but he's male. Since the examples are female, perhaps the theme is female artists with those traits. So Bowie would get a 0. But the user said the anti-examples can be female, so maybe gender isn't the criteria. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "female artists who have won multiple Grammys or had significant critical acclaim." Not sure. 

This is tricky. Let me try to assign scores based on the idea that the theme is reinvention, artistic experimentation, and a strong visual identity beyond just music. 

1. Bonnie Tyler: Not much reinvention, 3
2. Janet Jackson: 8 (reinvented multiple times)
3. Cher: 9 (constantly reinvented)
4. David Bowie: 10 (but since the examples are female, maybe 0? Wait, but the theme isn't gender. The user says the theme is based on the examples, which are female, but the anti-examples are also female. So maybe Bowie is a 10, but the user might not want that. Alternatively, the theme could exclude male artists, but since the user didn't specify, perhaps I should go with the actual criteria. Hmm. Maybe the user expects Bowie to be excluded because the examples are female, so 0. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the theme is female artists who are not just singers but also known for their songwriting and artistic control. Kate Bush and Annie Lennox are songwriters. Madonna is a co-writer. The anti-examples: Grace Jones sometimes writes, Debbie Harry with Chris Stein, Pat Benatar? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the theme could be "female artists who have had a significant impact on pop music with a focus on artistic reinvention and a unique persona." Then Bowie would fit that but is male, so perhaps the examples are female, so Bowie gets 0. 

I think I'll proceed with that assumption. So:

1. Bonnie Tyler: 3
2. Janet Jackson: 8
3. Cher: 9
4. David Bowie: 0
5. Stevie Nicks: 5 (has a unique persona but maybe less reinvention)
6. Whitney Houston: 2 (very traditional pop)
7. Cyndi Lauper: 6 (unique style, but maybe not as much reinvention as Madonna/Cher)
8. Tina Turner: 4 (powerful, but consistent style)
