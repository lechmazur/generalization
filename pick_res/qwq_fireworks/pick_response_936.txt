Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the examples given. The examples are the Treaty of Versailles, Camp David Accords, and Treaty of Tordesillas. The anti-examples are the Good Friday Agreement, Helsinki Accords, and North Atlantic Treaty. 

Starting with the examples: 

1. **Treaty of Versailles** - This was a peace treaty signed after World War I to end the state of war between the Allied Powers and Germany. It's a major international treaty with significant geopolitical consequences.
2. **Camp David Accords** - These were agreements between Israel and Egypt, mediated by the US, leading to a peace treaty. They're more about diplomatic agreements between specific countries with a mediator.
3. **Treaty of Tordesillas** - A 15th-century treaty between Spain and Portugal to divide newly discovered lands outside Europe. It was about territorial division under the sponsorship of the Catholic Church.

Looking for commonalities: All three are treaties that deal with significant territorial or political divisions, often between major powers, sometimes involving mediation or international bodies. They have a historical significance in shaping geopolitical boundaries or relationships.

Now the anti-examples:

1. **Good Friday Agreement** - Resolved the conflict in Northern Ireland. It's a peace agreement but more about internal political structures and power-sharing rather than territorial division between nations.
2. **Helsinki Accords (Helsinki Final Act)** - Part of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, focusing on reducing tensions during the Cold War. It's more about security and human rights rather than territorial division.
3. **North Atlantic Treaty (NATO)** - Establishes an international alliance for collective defense. It's a mutual defense pact rather than a territorial or boundary agreement.

So the specific theme seems to be treaties that establish or divide territorial claims or major geopolitical boundaries between nations, often with international or mediatory involvement, and have a historical impact on shaping regions. The anti-examples are either about non-territorial agreements (like security, peace processes within a region, or alliances) even if they are significant.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. **Schengen Agreement** - Removes internal borders between participating EU countries. It's about free movement, not territorial division. But it does involve a collective agreement changing borders' function. However, since it's more about removing borders rather than dividing territories, maybe a 4? Not sure yet.

2. **Geneva Convention** - International treaties on humanitarian law, especially in war. Not about territorial division. Definitely an anti-example. Maybe 0 or 1.

3. **Maastricht Treaty** - Led to the European Union and introduced the euro. It's a foundational treaty for economic and political integration. Not territorial division, so probably low score, like 2.

4. **Magna Carta** - Medieval document limiting the king's power in England. Domestic constitutional document, not an international treaty. So 0.

5. **Peace of Westphalia** - Ended the Thirty Years' War, established state sovereignty and territorial boundaries. This is very similar to the examples. Probably a 10, but need to check if it's exactly like the given examples. Since Treaty of Versailles and Tordesillas are about territorial division, Westphalia is a key example of state sovereignty and borders, so maybe 9 or 10. But since it's an exact fit, maybe 10?

Wait, the original examples include Tordesillas (territorial division), Versailles (post-war territorial), and Camp David (peace but between specific nations). The Peace of Westphalia is a classic example of treaty ending war and defining sovereignty, so maybe 10.

6. **Charter of the United Nations** and 7. **United Nations Charter** - These are the same. The UN Charter establishes the UN, an international organization. It's a foundational treaty but not about territorial division. So maybe 1 or 2.

8. **Lisbon Treaty** - Amended the EU's foundational treaties, similar to Maastricht. Not territorial, so low score, maybe 2 or 3.

Wait, but let me recheck each candidate carefully.

1. **Schengen Agreement**: Removes borders between EU members. It's a treaty altering territorial boundaries' function but not creating or dividing territories. It's more about free movement. So maybe 3?

2. **Geneva Convention**: Definitely not related. 0.

3. **Maastricht Treaty**: EU integration, not territorial. 1.

4. **Magna Carta**: Domestic, not treaty. 0.

5. **Peace of Westphalia**: Perfect fit. 10.

6 &7. **UN Charter**: Establishes international organization, not territorial division. 0 or 1. Since it's a major treaty but not fitting the theme, maybe 1.

8. **Lisbon Treaty**: Similar to Maastricht, so 1 or 2. Let's say 2.

Wait, maybe the Treaty of Tordesillas was about dividing territories between Spain and Portugal, so treaties that divide or establish territories between nations. The Camp David Accords established peace and territorial recognition (Israel-Egypt). The Peace of Westphalia definitely divided territories and recognized sovereignty. 

Schengen Agreement is about removing borders but not dividing. So maybe 3 is okay. 

Maastricht Treaty is about EU structure. 1.

Lisbon similar. 2.

So scores:

1. Schengen: Maybe 3 (since it's a treaty affecting borders but not dividing territories)

2. Geneva: 0

3. Maastricht: 1

4. Magna Carta: 0

5. Westphalia: 10

6 &7. UN: 1

8. Lisbon: 2

Wait, but the user listed 7 as United Nations Charter, which is the same as 6. But they are separate entries here. So both 6 and 7 would get 1. 

Wait, the user lists them as separate candidates, so I have to treat them as separate. But they are the same document, so both get 1.

So final scores:

1. 3

2. 0

3. 1

4. 0

5. 10

6. 1

7. 1

8. 2

But let me see again. Maybe Schengen is a bit higher? Because it's a treaty altering borders between countries, even if removing them. The original examples involve creating or dividing territories. Schengen is more about cooperation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 2?

Alternatively, maybe the Camp David Accords and Tordesillas are peace treaties or division treaties, so perhaps the theme is "significant treaties that redefine territorial boundaries or sovereignty between states." 

The Peace of Westphalia (5) is a classic example. Treaty of Versailles (redrew European borders), Tordesillas (divided colonies), Camp David (Egypt and Israel recognized each other's territories). So Schengen is about removing borders but not dividing, so maybe 2. 

Maastricht (3) is EU integration, so 1. 

Lisbon (8) is similar, 2. 

Geneva (2) 0. 

Magna Carta (4) 0. 

UN (6 and7) 1 each. 

So final scores:

1. Schengen: 2 or 3. Let's say 3 because it's a treaty affecting borders, even if not dividing. 

2. Geneva: 0

3. Maastricht:1

4. Magna:0

5. Westphalia:10

6. UN:1

7. UN:1

8. Lisbon:2

Alternatively, maybe Schengen is a 4? Since it's a treaty that has a major impact on borders but not exactly dividing. Hmm, perhaps the scale is tricky. Since the examples are all about creating or dividing territories, the closest would be Westphalia (10). The others are lower. 

Another thought: The Treaty of Tordesillas was about colonial division, Versailles about post-war territorial changes, Camp David about recognizing borders between nations. The theme could be treaties that establish or redefine territorial boundaries between states. 

Schengen removes internal borders but between EU states. So it's a treaty that changes borders, but not dividing territories between different nations. It's more about integration. So maybe 3. 

Maastricht is about EU integration, so 1. 

Lisbon is similar, 2. 

Okay, proceeding with that.
