Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are:

1. A vintage typewriter as a decorative object on a writer's desk.
2. A decommissioned lighthouse still standing sentinel against the sea.
3. A cassette tape mixtape tucked away in a dusty box of memories.

Looking at these, they all seem to have a few common elements. They are all objects that were once functional but are now either retired from their original use or preserved in a way that highlights their past role. The typewriter is no longer used for writing but is decorative; the lighthouse is decommissioned but still stands; the cassette tape is a mixtape stored away, so it's more about memory than current use. The key here seems to be objects that have outlived their original purpose but retain a symbolic or nostalgic presence. They’re not just old items but have a specific role in being preserved as a remnant of the past, often in a context that acknowledges their former use.

Now, the anti-examples are:

1. An obsolete computer
2. A forgotten toy in the attic
3. A dried-up flower

These are items that are outdated or forgotten but might not fit the specific theme. The obsolete computer is no longer used, but maybe it's not necessarily displayed or kept as a nostalgic item. The forgotten toy is in the attic, which might just be neglected rather than intentionally preserved. The dried-up flower is a remnant but perhaps not an object that had a functional purpose before. The anti-examples might be more about being abandoned or simply outdated without the intentional preservation or symbolic presence aspect.

So the specific theme is probably objects that were once functional but are now in a state where they’re either retired from use but kept as decorative, symbolic, or memory-holding items. They’re not just old or broken but have a purpose in their current state that relates to their past.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **A rusty bicycle**: Rust suggests neglect, maybe abandoned. But is it kept as a decorative or symbolic item? If it's just left to rust, maybe it's more like the forgotten toy. But if it's displayed as a relic, then maybe. Not sure. Maybe a 3 or 4.

2. **An empty perfume bottle**: If it's empty and kept, maybe as a memory of the perfume or the time it was used. That fits the mixtape example. So maybe a 7 or 8.

3. **A historical artifact in a museum**: The examples are more about personal or domestic contexts. A museum artifact is preserved but in a different context. The original theme seems more about personal use or home settings. So maybe a 4 or 5, not exact.

4. **A vintage car in perfect working order**: The examples are about objects that are no longer in use. If the car is still working, it's not decommissioned. So maybe a 2 or 3. Doesn't fit the decommissioned aspect.

5. **A rotary phone, still displayed in a mid-century modern home**: This is a functional-looking item but displayed. It's kept as a decorative piece, like the typewriter. So a strong match. Maybe 8 or 9.

6. **A modern art sculpture made of discarded materials**: The materials are discarded, but the sculpture is a new creation. The theme is about objects in their original form, not repurposed into art. So maybe a 1 or 2.

7. **A faded photograph**: Faded but kept as a memory. Similar to the mixtape. A good match, maybe 7 or 8.

8. **A fully functional gramophone**: Like the vintage car, if it's still working, it's not decommissioned. So maybe a 3 or 4.

Wait, let me recheck each one carefully.

1. Rusty bicycle: If it's rusty but kept, maybe as decoration. But if it's just abandoned, then no. The examples have intentional preservation (decorative, tucked away). Rusty bike could be either. Maybe a 4.

2. Empty perfume bottle: If it's kept as a keepsake, then yes. Like the mixtape. So 7.

3. Historical artifact: Museum is a different context. The examples are personal or in a home. So maybe 4.

4. Vintage car in working order: Not decommissioned. So 2.

5. Rotary phone displayed: Perfect match. 9.

6. Modern sculpture: Not the original object's use. 1.

7. Faded photo: Tucked away memories, so 8.

8. Functional gramophone: Still works, so not decommissioned. 3.

Hmm, but the lighthouse is decommissioned but still standing. The gramophone is functional, so it's still used, unlike the decommissioned items. So 3 makes sense.

I need to ensure the scores are spread across the scale. Let me adjust:

1. Rusty bicycle: Maybe 3 (since it's not clear if it's kept intentionally or just abandoned, leaning towards anti-example's forgotten toy, but maybe a bit of a match if it's decorative).

2. Empty perfume bottle: 7 (definite match as a memory object).

3. Historical artifact: 4 (museum vs personal context).

4. Vintage car working: 2 (still functional, so not decommissioned).

5. Rotary phone: 9 (matches exactly like the typewriter).

6. Sculpture: 1 (repurposed, not original use).

7. Faded photo: 8 (similar to mixtape, but photo is more of a memory item, so maybe 8).

8. Functional gramophone: 3 (like the car, still works so not decommissioned).

That seems consistent. Let me check again for each candidate against the theme's key points: once functional, now not in use, preserved as a decorative or memory item in a personal/domestic setting. 

Yes, that's the core. So the scores should reflect how well they fit that.
