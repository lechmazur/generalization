Alright, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples: Enigma, Odyssey, Apollo. Then, I have to determine why the anti-examples (Eclipse, Oracle, Phantom) don't fit that exact theme but might fit a broader one. Finally, I need to score each candidate based on how well they fit the specific theme.

Starting with the examples. Let's break them down:

- **Enigma**: This refers to a puzzle, mystery, or something difficult to understand. It's about complexity and unresolved questions.
- **Odyssey**: A long journey, often with trials and tribulations. It's a narrative of adventure and exploration.
- **Apollo**: The Greek god of light, truth, and prophecy. Also, Apollo is the name of NASA's moon mission program.

Hmm, maybe there's a connection here. Let me think of common threads. Apollo is a name from Greek mythology, as well as a space mission. Odyssey is a classic epic poem by Homer. Enigma is more of a concept. Wait, perhaps they are all names of missions or projects? Apollo was a NASA mission. Odyssey might refer to the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. Enigma isn't a mission, though. Alternatively, maybe they are all names of NASA missions? Let me check: Apollo is definitely a NASA mission. There's also the Mars Odyssey. But Enigma isn't a mission. Maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe they are all names of something celestial or related to space? Apollo is associated with the sun in mythology, and the Apollo missions went to the moon. Odyssey could relate to space exploration. Enigma might not fit here. Hmm, not sure yet.

Another angle: All three are names of things that have a grand, epic, or mythological connotation. Apollo is a god, Odyssey is an epic journey, Enigma is a mysterious concept. Maybe the theme is "mythological or legendary figures or concepts associated with exploration, knowledge, or mystery." But then why are the anti-examples not fitting? Let's check the anti-examples:

- **Eclipse**: A celestial event, which is astronomical but perhaps not tied to the same mythological or epic journey aspect. Eclipse is more of a natural phenomenon.
- **Oracle**: A source of prophecy, which is related to Apollo (since Apollo's temple at Delphi had the Oracle). But maybe the anti-example is because Oracle is more about prophecy, whereas the theme is about the journey or the enigma itself?
- **Phantom**: Something intangible, ghost-like, which might be more of an enigma but perhaps not tied to the specific context of the examples.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "names of NASA missions or projects"? Apollo and Odyssey are NASA missions, but Enigma isn't. Wait, Enigma could be a stretch here. Maybe Enigma refers to the Enigma machine, but that's WWII cryptography. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the theme is "names of celestial bodies or space-related projects"? Apollo (moon mission), Odyssey (spacecraft), and Enigma might not fit. Alternatively, Enigma could be a space mission? Not that I know of. Hmm.

Alternatively, the theme could be "names of missions, projects, or concepts named after mythological figures or epic journeys." Apollo (mythological god and mission), Odyssey (Homer's epic and a spacecraft), and Enigma (maybe as a concept, but not sure). The anti-examples: Eclipse is a natural event, Oracle is a mythological figure but perhaps not tied to a mission, Phantom is a ghostly concept not linked to missions. So maybe the theme is "mythological figures or epic journeys used as names for space missions or projects." 

If that's the case, then let's look at the candidates:

1. **Neptune**: A planet. Neptune is a celestial body. But Neptune isn't a mission or a project name, unless there's a mission named Neptune. There's Voyager 2 which visited Neptune, but Neptune itself is a planet. So maybe not a direct fit. But perhaps Neptune could be considered as a celestial body, but the examples are more about missions or concepts named after something else. Maybe Neptune would get a lower score because it's the actual planet, not a mission or project named after it. Unless the theme is "celestial bodies and mythological figures associated with exploration," then Neptune (as a planet named after the god) might fit. Let's see.

2. **Thunder**: A natural phenomenon. Not a mission or mythological figure in the same way. Maybe associated with Zeus (who controls thunder), but Thunder itself isn't a mission or a named project. So probably a low score.

3. **Da Vinci**: A historical figure (Leonardo da Vinci). He's not a mythological figure or a space mission. The examples are more about mythological or epic concepts. Unless Da Vinci is linked to some project named after him, but I don't think so. So low score.

4. **Firefly**: There was a NASA mission called Firefly, and also the TV show "Firefly" by Joss Whedon. But as a mission name, Firefly might fit. However, the examples are Apollo, Odyssey, Enigma. Firefly as a mission could be a decent fit. Maybe medium score.

5. **Serenity**: The Serenity spacecraft from the TV show "Firefly," or perhaps another mission? Serenity is also a concept of calmness. Not sure if there's a mission named Serenity. Maybe a lower score unless it's a mission.

6. **Spectre**: A mission? Spectre is also the name of a Bond villain organization, or perhaps a spacecraft. The James Webb Space Telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) but not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a mission named Spectre? If not, then it's a stretch. Maybe medium-low.

7. **Horizon**: There's the New Horizons mission to Pluto. So Horizon (as in New Horizons) would be a good fit. So high score.

8. **Harrier**: The Harrier jet is a vertical takeoff aircraft, not a space mission. Unless there's a mission named Harrier, which I don't recall. So probably low score.

Wait, let me confirm the missions:

- Apollo: Definitely NASA moon missions.
- Odyssey: Mars Odyssey orbiter.
- Enigma: Not a mission. Hmm, maybe Enigma is a red herring here. Alternatively, maybe the theme isn't missions. Let me think again.

Alternative angle: All three examples (Enigma, Odyssey, Apollo) could be names of movies or TV shows? Enigma might not, but Odyssey (maybe the movie?), Apollo 13? Not sure. Alternatively, they could be names of bands, like Enigma (band), but that might not fit.

Alternatively, the theme could be "words that are also the names of planets or celestial bodies." But Apollo isn't a planet. Enigma isn't. Odyssey isn't. So no.

Wait, maybe the theme is "names of Greek gods or epic concepts." Apollo is a Greek god. Odyssey is an epic by Homer. Enigma is a concept but not a god. Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, "terms associated with exploration and mystery." Enigma (mystery), Odyssey (exploration journey), Apollo (as in the god of light, which could symbolize enlightenment or exploration). Maybe the theme is "concepts or figures symbolizing exploration, knowledge, or mystery." Then the anti-examples: Eclipse (a celestial event, but not exactly exploration), Oracle (related to prophecy, which is a form of knowledge but maybe not exploration), Phantom (mysterious but not exploration-focused). 

If that's the case, then candidates:

1. Neptune: The planet, named after the Roman god of the sea. A celestial body, which could be part of exploration. Maybe a decent fit, but not as directly as Apollo or Odyssey. Maybe 5/10?

2. Thunder: A natural phenomenon, maybe associated with storms, but not directly exploration or mystery. Low score, 2?

3. Da Vinci: A historical figure known for innovation and knowledge. Could fit the knowledge aspect, but not exploration in the same way. Maybe 4?

4. Firefly: A TV show about space travel, so exploration. If the theme includes fictional explorations, maybe 7?

5. Serenity: The ship in Firefly, so same as above. Maybe 6?

6. Spectre: The movie Spectre (Bond) is more about espionage, not exploration. Or Spectre as a phenomenon? Maybe 3?

7. Horizon: The James Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) or New Horizons mission. Definitely exploration. High score, 9?

8. Harrier: Military aircraft, not exploration-focused. Low, 1?

Alternatively, maybe the theme is specifically "names of NASA missions." Then Apollo and Odyssey fit, but Enigma does not. So that might not be it.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "names of missions or projects related to space exploration named after mythological figures or epic concepts." Apollo (god, mission), Odyssey (epic, mission), and Enigma (maybe a project named after the concept?). If that's the case, then:

1. Neptune: Planet, not a mission. 0?

2. Thunder: Not a mission. 0?

3. Da Vinci: No mission named after him. 0?

4. Firefly: NASA's Firefly missions (small satellites). Yes. 8?

5. Serenity: Maybe part of a mission? Not sure. If Firefly is a mission, Serenity might be part of it? Or maybe not. 3?

6. Spectre: Not a mission I can recall. 1?

7. Horizon: New Horizons mission. 10?

8. Harrier: No, 0?

But the user said the anti-examples are Eclipse, Oracle, Phantom. Let me check if Eclipse is a mission. There's the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's CRaTER instrument, but Eclipse isn't a mission name. Oracle could be a project name, but not a mission. Phantom is not.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "words that are both celestial and mythological." Apollo (sun god, moon mission), Odyssey (journey, Mars mission), Enigma (maybe not celestial, but a puzzle). Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: Think of the examples and anti-examples. The examples are Enigma (mystery), Odyssey (journey), Apollo (god/mission). The anti-examples are Eclipse (celestial event), Oracle (prophet), Phantom (ghost). The difference is that the examples might be more about exploration, missions, or grand concepts, whereas the anti-examples are more about specific phenomena or roles (Oracle as a role, Eclipse as an event, Phantom as a being). 

Perhaps the theme is "names of space missions or projects that evoke epic journeys or exploration." Apollo (moon missions), Odyssey (Mars orbiter), and Enigma (maybe a mission? Or perhaps Enigma here is a stretch, but the user says it's part of the examples). If that's the case, then the candidates:

1. Neptune: A planet, not a mission. Unless there's a Neptune mission, but not as prominent as Apollo or Odyssey. Maybe 3?

2. Thunder: No mission, 0?

3. Da Vinci: No, 0?

4. Firefly: Yes, Firefly was a NASA mission (small satellites). 8?

5. Serenity: The ship from Firefly, but not a mission name. Maybe 2?

6. Spectre: Not a mission, 1?

7. Horizon: New Horizons mission. 10?

8. Harrier: No, 0?

Alternatively, if Enigma is part of the theme, maybe it's about "terms that are both a concept and a mission/project name." Enigma (concept + maybe a mission?), but not sure. 

Alternatively, the theme is "terms that are names of both mythological figures and space missions." Apollo (god and mission), Odyssey (Homer's epic and mission), Enigma (maybe a stretch as a concept linked to a mission?). Then the anti-examples are:

- Eclipse: A natural event (not a mission or mythological figure beyond maybe Helios? Not directly).

- Oracle: A role (like at Delphi), but not a mission.

- Phantom: Not a mission or a direct mythological figure (maybe a ghost, but not a god).

So for the candidates:

1. Neptune: Roman god of the sea, but no prominent mission named Neptune. Maybe 2?

2. Thunder: Not a god, but Zeus's domain. No mission. 0?

3. Da Vinci: Human, not a god, no mission named after him. 0?

4. Firefly: Mission, but not a mythological figure. So maybe 5?

5. Serenity: Part of Firefly, but not a mission name. 1?

6. Spectre: Not a mission or god. 0?

7. Horizon: New Horizons mission, but "Horizon" alone isn't a god. 5?

Wait, but New Horizons is the mission to Pluto. So "Horizon" is part of the name. Maybe that's a 7?

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me try another angle. Maybe the theme is "names of NASA missions that are also names of Greek/Roman mythological figures or epic journeys." Apollo (god, mission), Odyssey (epic, mission), Enigma might not fit here, but maybe it's part of the examples so perhaps Enigma is a mission? Not sure. Alternatively, Enigma could be a concept linked to mystery, which is part of exploration.

Alternatively, the examples could be "terms that are both a concept and a mission name." Apollo (mission and god), Odyssey (mission and epic), Enigma (concept and maybe a mission? Not sure). The anti-examples are terms that are either just concepts or phenomena but not missions. So:

- Eclipse is a phenomenon, not a mission.

- Oracle is a concept (prophet), not a mission.

- Phantom is a concept (ghost), not a mission.

Thus, the theme is "names that are both a mission/project and a concept/epic/myth." So the candidates:

1. Neptune: Planet (not a mission) but Neptune could be a mission name? Not that I know. 0?

2. Thunder: No mission, 0.

3. Da Vinci: No mission, 0.

4. Firefly: Mission (NASA's Firefly satellites). So yes, 8?

5. Serenity: Maybe part of a mission? If Firefly's ship is Serenity, but not a mission name. 3.

6. Spectre: No, 0.

7. Horizon: New Horizons mission. 10?

8. Harrier: No, 0.

Alternatively, if the theme is "names of space missions," then the scores would be higher for mission-related terms. But Enigma isn't a mission, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "words that are names of missions and also have a meaning related to exploration or mystery." Apollo (exploration), Odyssey (exploration), Enigma (mystery). Anti-examples: Eclipse (celestial event but not mystery/exploration directly), Oracle (knowledge but not exploration), Phantom (mystery but not exploration). So candidates:

1. Neptune: Exploration (space missions to Neptune exist, like Voyager 2), so maybe 6?

2. Thunder: Not directly related. 2.

3. Da Vinci: Knowledge but not exploration. 4.

4. Firefly: Mission related to space. 8.

5. Serenity: Part of a fictional space exploration (Firefly series), so maybe 7.

6. Spectre: Maybe espionage, not exploration. 3.

7. Horizon: New Horizons mission. 10.

8. Harrier: Military aircraft, not space. 1.

This seems plausible. Assigning scores based on how well they fit as either a mission name linked to exploration/mystery or the concept itself being about exploration/mystery.

So final scores (my best guess):

1. Neptune: 5 (exploration but not a mission name)

2. Thunder: 2

3. Da Vinci: 4 (knowledge, but not exploration)

4. Firefly: 8 (mission)

5. Serenity: 6 (fictional exploration)

6. Spectre: 3

7. Horizon: 10 (New Horizons)

8. Harrier: 1

Wait, but the user said to use the full range 0-10. Let me adjust to ensure spread.

Alternatively:

1. Neptune: 4 (since it's a planet, but missions have gone there)

2. Thunder: 1

3. Da Vinci: 3 (his works are about knowledge)

4. Firefly: 7 (mission, but not as prominent as Apollo)

5. Serenity: 5 (fictional, so less direct)

6. Spectre: 2 (maybe a stretch with mystery)

7. Horizon: 10 (New Horizons)

8. Harrier: 0

Hmm, but I need to be consistent. Let me think again.

Perhaps the key is that the examples (Enigma, Odyssey, Apollo) are all names of NASA missions. Wait, Apollo is definitely a mission. Odyssey is a Mars mission. Enigma might not be, but the user includes it as an example. Maybe Enigma here refers to something else, like the Enigma machine (WWII cipher device), but that's unrelated. Alternatively, maybe "Enigma" is part of a mission's name. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "names of missions or concepts related to exploration, with a touch of mystery or grandeur."

Alternatively, the theme could be "names of celestial bodies or space-related projects with a mythological or epic connotation." Apollo (mythology and mission), Odyssey (epic and mission), Enigma (mystery, perhaps a project name). Anti-examples are Eclipse (mythological? Maybe Helios, but not directly), Oracle (mythological but not a mission), Phantom (not mythological). 

So candidates:

1. Neptune: Mythological god, and planet. 8?

2. Thunder: Not a god, but Zeus's domain. 4?

3. Da Vinci: Human, not mythological. 2?

4. Firefly: Mission name. 7?

5. Serenity: Part of Firefly, so maybe 6?

6. Spectre: Not mythological. 3?

7. Horizon: Mission, but "Horizon" isn't mythological. 5?

8. Harrier: 0?

Hmm, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I should go with the first approach where the theme is NASA missions named after mythological figures or epics, plus Enigma as a stretch. Then:

- Apollo: mission and god

- Odyssey: mission and epic

- Enigma: maybe a mission? Or perhaps the theme is "terms that are both a concept and a mission name." Enigma as a concept plus a mission (if any). Alternatively, the user might have a different angle.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "names of projects or missions named after Greek/Roman mythology or epic journeys." Thus:

- Apollo (Greek god, mission)

- Odyssey (Homer's epic, mission)

- Enigma (maybe not mythological, but perhaps a project named after it?)

Anti-examples:

- Eclipse: not mythological

- Oracle: part of Greek mythology (Oracle of Delphi), but not a mission name

- Phantom: not mythological

Thus, the candidates:

1. Neptune: Roman god, but no prominent mission. Maybe 4.

2. Thunder: Zeus's domain, but no mission. 2.

3. Da Vinci: Not mythological, 0.

4. Firefly: Mission, not mythological. 7.

5. Serenity: Part of Firefly, but not mission name. 3.

6. Spectre: No, 1.

7. Horizon: New Horizons, mission. 9 (since it's a mission but "Horizon" isn't mythological)

8. Harrier: No, 0.

Hmm, but Enigma might be a problem here since it doesn't fit the mythological angle. Maybe the theme isn't strictly mythological but includes epic concepts. So Enigma as a concept of mystery fits the broader theme of exploration's unknowns. So maybe the theme is "terms associated with exploration, mystery, or grand journeys, whether mythological or otherwise." Then:

- Enigma (mystery)

- Odyssey (journey)

- Apollo (exploration mission)

Anti-examples:

- Eclipse (natural event, not directly exploration)

- Oracle (knowledge, but not journey/exploration focus)

- Phantom (mystery but not exploration)

So candidates:

1. Neptune: Exploration target (space missions), 6.

2. Thunder: Not directly, 2.

3. Da Vinci: Knowledge but not exploration, 3.

4. Firefly: Mission related to space, 8.

5. Serenity: Fictional space ship, 7.

6. Spectre: Maybe a spy mission? 4.

7. Horizon: New Horizons mission, 10.

8. Harrier: Military aircraft, 1.

This seems more consistent. Assigning scores based on how directly they relate to space exploration or the concept of exploration/mystery:

1. Neptune: 6 (planetary exploration)

2. Thunder: 2 (not related)

3. Da Vinci: 3 (knowledge but not space)

4. Firefly: 8 (mission)

5. Serenity: 7 (fictional space exploration)

6. Spectre: 4 (maybe a mission name? Not sure, but gives it some)

7. Horizon: 10 (New Horizons)

8. Harrier: 1

Alternatively, Spectre might get a 2.

But I think I'll go with this set of scores, ensuring they are spread across the range.
