Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to understand the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are all about devices that automatically adjust based on user routines, preferences, or environmental factors. The key here is automation and learning or adapting without manual input. 

The anti-examples are the opposite: they require manual adjustments and don't adapt on their own. So the specific theme is devices that autonomously modify their settings based on user behavior, preferences, or environmental data.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. A simple heater with a manual dial. This is like the anti-examples. No automation, so definitely a 0 or low score. Probably 0 or 1. Since the anti-examples are 0, maybe 0?

2. Non-smart speaker that doesn't adjust sound. Again, manual, so similar to anti-examples. 0 or 1.

3. Standard air purifier with fixed settings. Manual again. 0.

4. Standard light switch. Definitely manual. 0.

5. Traditional humidifier, manual. 0.

6. Manual window blind. The anti-example 6 is a manual window shade. The original examples had a smart window shade. So this is an exact anti-example, so 0.

7. Intelligent lighting system that adapts to mood and time. This fits the theme perfectly. It's adaptive based on user preferences (mood) and time (environmental factor). So 10.

8. Remote-controlled ceiling fan. Wait, remote control requires user input each time. It's not learning or adjusting automatically. So it's manual, even if remote. So similar to the anti-examples. Maybe 0 or 1. But the question says anti-examples are the ones that follow a broader theme. Wait, the anti-examples are things that are basic and manual, so this is like them. So 0 or 1. But maybe remote-controlled is a step above? Hmm, but the key is whether it learns or adjusts on its own. Since it's remote-controlled manually, it's still 0.

Wait, but let me check the examples again. The examples all have some form of learning or adapting based on user routines or environment. The anti-examples are things that don't do that. The candidates 1-6 and 8 are all manual, so 0. The 7th is the only one that matches. But wait, maybe some candidates have partial features?

Wait, candidate 7 is exactly like the examples. So 10. The rest are all 0. But the instructions say to use the full range. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine each candidate again carefully.

Looking again:

The theme is devices that "learn and adjust based on occupants' routines, preferences, or environment". So adaptive based on user behavior/environment without manual input.

Candidate 7: intelligent lighting that adapts to user's mood and time. That's exactly the theme. So 10.

The rest are all manual or fixed. So why are the anti-examples given as 0, but maybe some candidates could have slight differences? Let's see:

Looking at candidate 8: remote-controlled ceiling fan. The user still has to adjust it manually via remote, so it's not adaptive. So 0.

Wait, but maybe "remote-controlled" is a feature, but it's still manual. So same as anti-examples. So all except 7 are 0. But the user said to use the full range of scores. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait the anti-examples include a manual thermostat, basic AC, regular fan. The candidates 1-6 and 8 are similar to those, so they should all be 0. But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe some are slightly better than others?

Alternatively, maybe some candidates have some adaptive features but not exactly the theme. Let me check again each candidate:

1. Heater with dial: manual. 0.

2. Non-smart speaker: no adaptation. 0.

3. Air purifier fixed: manual. 0.

4. Light switch: manual. 0.

5. Humidifier manual: 0.

6. Manual window blind: 0.

7. Intelligent lighting: 10.

8. Remote fan: manual. 0.

Hmm, but the user said to use the full range from 0-10, but all except 7 are 0? That might not use the full range. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the theme.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "smart devices that adjust automatically based on user habits or environment". The anti-examples are non-smart, manual ones. So the candidates that are smart but maybe not exactly the same as examples might get some points?

Wait the examples include learning (thermostat), adaptive sound (based on habits and noise), smart window shades (user preferences and light). So the key is that they adapt automatically using some intelligence based on user behavior or environment.

Looking at candidate 7: yes, exactly that. The others are all non-smart. So perhaps the scores are all 0 except 7 as 10. But that uses only 0 and 10, which the user said to avoid. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait maybe the candidates have some adaptive features but not exactly. Let me re-read the candidates again.

Wait candidate 8: remote-controlled ceiling fan. Maybe "remote-controlled" is a form of automation? No, it's still manual. The user has to control it each time. So no.

Wait candidate 6: manual window blind. The example had a smart window shade that adjusts automatically. So the anti-example is manual. So 0.

Hmm. Maybe the user expects some candidates to have partial features. For instance, maybe a remote-controlled device could be considered slightly better than a manual dial, but not adaptive. But according to the theme, they need to adjust without user input. So all non-adaptive ones are 0. But the user wants the scores to use the full range, so perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "smart home devices that adapt based on user preferences and environment", and the anti-examples are non-smart. The candidates 1-6 and 8 are non-smart (so 0-2), but maybe some are slightly better? Or maybe some candidates are semi-automatic?

Wait, the user might have intended that some candidates are partially adaptive but not fully. Let me check again:

Looking at candidate 7 is clearly a 10. The others:

Is there any candidate that is partially adaptive but not fully? For example, maybe a remote-controlled device could be considered as having some level of control, but not learning. But the theme requires learning or adapting based on routines/preferences. So no.

Alternatively, maybe the "intelligent lighting" is the only one. The rest are all non-smart. So perhaps the user expects that the scores for non-matching candidates should be spread out more. But according to the anti-examples, they are all 0. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps some devices are adaptive but not based on user routines. For example, maybe a light that adjusts based on time (like a timer) but not user behavior. Wait candidate 7 includes time of day, which is part of the examples (like the window shade adjusting throughout the day). So that's acceptable.

Wait the first example's thermostat adjusts based on daily routines, so time of day is part of that. So candidate 7's time of day is okay.

Hmm, maybe I need to assign all non-matching as 0, but the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, looking back, the user said the anti-examples can follow a broader theme but not the specific one. So maybe some candidates are in the broader category but not the specific. Let me think of the theme again: the examples are all smart devices that learn and adjust automatically based on user behavior and environment. The anti-examples are non-smart, manual devices.

The candidates 1-6 and 8 are all non-smart and manual, so they are anti-examples (score 0). But the user said to use the full range. Maybe some of them are slightly better than others in a way that's closer to the broader theme?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some candidates have some automated features but not based on learning. For example, a light that turns on at sunset (fixed schedule) but not based on user preferences. That would be a broader theme. But the candidates don't mention that. The candidates listed are all manual.

Wait candidate 8 is remote-controlled, which is still manual. So all except 7 are 0. But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the theme. Let me re-express the theme from the examples:

Specific theme: Devices that automatically adjust their settings in response to user routines/preferences and environmental factors, using some form of learning or adaptive algorithms.

Anti-examples are devices that require manual input and don't adapt.

Now, the candidates:

1-6,8: all manual. So 0.

7: 10.

But the user said to use the full range. Hmm. Maybe the user expects some of the candidates to be in the middle?

Wait maybe I misread some candidates. Let me check again:

Candidate 7 is intelligent lighting adapting to mood and time. That's perfect.

What about candidate 8? "Remote-controlled ceiling fan that users must adjust manually." Even with a remote, it's still manual. So 0.

Wait perhaps the "remote-controlled" part is a feature that allows control without being physically present, but it's still manual. So no automation.

Hmm, perhaps the user expects some candidates to have some adaptive features but not full learning. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the theme also includes devices that adjust based on environmental factors without learning, but the examples include both learning and environmental factors. For instance, the window shade adjusts based on light levels (environment) and user preferences. The sound system uses ambient noise (environment) and user habits. The thermostat uses routines (user behavior).

So the key is both environmental and user-based factors, and automatic adjustment. So a device that adjusts based on environment but not user preferences might be a partial match.

Looking at the candidates again, are any of them adjusting based on environment without user input but not learning?

None of the candidates except 7 mention that. The examples include both aspects. So perhaps only 7 qualifies.

Alternatively, maybe a device that adjusts based on time (like a timer) but not user behavior. But the examples do include time of day as part of the routine. So maybe a timer-based system would get some points?

But the candidates don't have such examples. The only one with time is candidate 7, which also includes mood (user preference).

Hmm. I think I have to go with 0 for all except 7 as 10. But since the user wants a full range, maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, maybe the anti-examples are not all 0. The user said anti-examples are not exact but can be in a broader theme. So perhaps some candidates are closer to the broader theme but not the specific. Let me see:

Suppose a device that adjusts based on environment but not learning. For example, a light that turns on when it's dark (sensors) but not based on user preferences. That would be a broader theme. But none of the candidates have that except maybe candidate 7's time of day. The others are all manual.

Wait candidate 7 is the only one. So perhaps the rest are all 0, but the user requires using the full scale. Maybe I need to assign some scores between 0-5 for the non-matching ones based on how close they are to the broader theme.

Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the theme. Let me think again. The examples all have learning or adapting based on user behavior and environment. So the theme is "smart devices with adaptive learning based on user routines and environmental factors".

The anti-examples are non-smart, manual devices. So the candidates that are smart but not learning-based might get some points?

Wait, for instance, if a device has fixed automation (like a timer) but no learning, it's a broader theme. But the user wants to exclude those. So such devices would be anti-examples. But none of the candidates have that except maybe candidate 7's time of day. But candidate 7 also includes user mood, so it's a better fit.

Alternatively, maybe the user considers "time of day" as part of the environment, so candidate 7 is perfect. The rest are non-smart, so 0.

Hmm. I think the user's examples are all about learning and adapting, so without that, it's 0. So I'll proceed with that. But since the user wants the full range, maybe I need to give some a 1 or 2.

Alternatively, maybe the manual devices can be considered as 0, but the remote-controlled one is a step above, so 1? But that's still 0. Maybe the scores are all 0 except 10. But the user said to use the full range, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait maybe the candidates include some that are partially adaptive. Let me check again:

Looking at candidate 7: yes, that's a 10.

Others:

1. Heater with dial: 0.

2. Non-smart speaker: 0.

3. Air purifier fixed: 0.

4. Light switch: 0.

5. Humidifier manual: 0.

6. Manual window blind: 0.

8. Remote fan: 0.

Hmm. This leaves only 10 and 0. The user wants scores from 0-10. Maybe I need to see if any of the candidates have any adaptive feature.

Wait candidate 8 is remote-controlled but still manual. So no.

Alternatively, maybe the intelligent lighting system (7) is 10, and others are 0. But the user might expect more nuanced scores. Maybe the user considers some devices as better in other aspects but not the theme.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the theme is "smart devices that adjust based on user behavior or environment", so even if they don't learn but just have sensors, they get some points.

Wait the first example's thermostat learns routines, the sound system uses habits and ambient noise, the window shade uses user preferences and light levels. So learning and environmental factors.

If a device uses environmental factors without learning, like a light that turns on when dark (without user input), that's a broader theme. But none of the candidates except 7 do that. The others are manual.

Wait candidate 7's time of day could be considered environmental (time) and user mood (preference). So that's perfect.

Hmm. I think I have to go with all except 7 as 0, but since the user requires a full range, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I need to assign 1s to some.

Alternatively, perhaps the candidates like the remote-controlled fan (8) is slightly better because it allows remote control, which is a form of automation but not adaptive. So maybe 1? While the manual dial heater is 0. So:

1. 0

2. 0

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 10

8. 1

That way, there's a 1 and 10. Maybe that's better. But the remote is still manual. Alternatively, maybe some have features that are partially adaptive. Hmm. I think I'll proceed with that.
