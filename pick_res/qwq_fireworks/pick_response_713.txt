Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given: alchemical mercury, mandrake root, and obsidian. Then, I have to consider the anti-examples (divining rod, crystal ball, astrological chart) which are related but not exact matches. The goal is to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not the broader or related ones.

Starting with the examples. Alchemical mercury is a key substance in alchemy, often associated with transformation and the primal elements. Mandrake root is a plant with a long history in magic, folklore, and herbalism, often used in spells or as an herbal remedy. Obsidian is a volcanic glass that's been used in various mystical practices, like scrying or as a protective stone. So, the common thread here might be items used in specific, perhaps older, magical or alchemical traditions, with a focus on natural materials that have symbolic or practical uses in those contexts.

Now the anti-examples: divining rod (used for dowsing, maybe more about finding things like water), crystal ball (common in fortune-telling, but maybe too broad or associated with general divination), and astrological chart (clearly tied to astrology, which is a system on its own). These are more about divination or general mystical tools, so the specific theme might exclude things that are primarily for prediction or broader mystical systems. The theme is more about materials or objects with a specific alchemical, herbal, or earth-based magical use, rather than tools for divination or astrology.

Looking at the candidates:

1. Tarot cards: These are used for divination, similar to crystal ball and astrological chart. So that's an anti-example's category. Probably a low score, maybe 0-3.

2. Smudging sage: Sage is used in purification rituals, like smudging. It's a natural material used in spiritual practices, similar to mandrake root. So maybe a higher score, like 7-8?

3. Voodoo doll: Associated with Voodoo practices, which are more ritualistic. It's a man-made object but tied to specific magical traditions. Maybe a 6-7?

4. Feng shui compass: Part of Feng Shui, which is more about energy flow and spatial arrangement. It's a tool for divination or layout, so similar to divining rod or astro chart. Lower score, maybe 2-4.

5. Dreamcatcher: A Native American tradition to protect from bad dreams. It's a symbolic object but maybe more decorative or general spiritual. Hmm, not sure. Maybe mid-range, like 5?

6. Runestones: These are used in runic magic, inscribed with runes for spells or divination. Wait, but runestones themselves as objects (like actual stones with runes) might be part of specific magical practices. But runic divination could be similar to tarot. Maybe 5-6?

7. Incense stick: Used in many rituals for scent and atmosphere. Natural material, but maybe too generic. Similar to sage but perhaps less specific. Maybe 4-5?

8. Quartz crystals: Often used in crystal healing and metaphysical practices. Quartz is a mineral, so similar to obsidian. But crystal balls are anti-examples, but maybe raw quartz is okay? So maybe 6-7?

Wait, but the anti-examples include crystal ball, which is made of quartz. So maybe quartz crystals could be considered too close to that? Hmm, tricky. Since obsidian is a type of stone, perhaps quartz crystals are acceptable as they are raw materials. So maybe higher, like 7?

Wait, but the anti-examples are about tools for divination. So quartz crystals as raw might be okay. Let me reassess:

Alchemical mercury (alchemical), mandrake root (herbal magic), obsidian (stone used in scrying or protection). The theme seems to be materials used in specific magical or alchemical practices, possibly natural elements with inherent mystical properties.

Tarot cards (divination tool) → low.

Smudging sage (natural, purification ritual) → high.

Voodoo doll (ritual object in Voodoo) → medium to high.

Feng shui compass (divination tool) → low.

Dreamcatcher (protective object, cultural tradition) → maybe medium.

Runestones (if they're the physical stones used in rituals, not for divination) → maybe medium.

Incense (common in rituals, but very common, not sure) → maybe medium.

Quartz crystals (used in metaphysical, like obsidian) → high, but conflicting because crystal balls are anti-examples. Maybe 6-7?

Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust. Let me go through each candidate again.

1. Tarot cards: Definitely a divination tool, so anti-example's category. Score 1 or 2.

2. Smudging sage: Natural material used in specific rituals, like mandrake. 8.

3. Voodoo doll: Ritual object in a specific tradition (Voodoo), so similar to mandrake root. 7.

4. Feng shui compass: Tool for divination/energy, so similar to divining rod. 2.

5. Dreamcatcher: Protective object, cultural but maybe not alchemical. 4.

6. Runestones: If they are used in runic magic (like casting runes for spells or divination), but since the theme is more materials, maybe they count. But runic divination is like tarot. Hmm, maybe 5?

7. Incense: Used in rituals, but very common and general. Maybe 3-4.

8. Quartz crystals: Like obsidian, a natural crystal used in metaphysical. But crystal ball is an anti-example. Since it's the raw material, maybe 7? But maybe the user thinks crystal balls are too connected, so lower? Maybe 6?

Wait, the examples include obsidian, which is a stone used in various ways. So quartz crystals, being another stone, might fit. So 7.

Wait, but the anti-examples are more about tools. So maybe quartz crystals are okay. Let me try assigning scores:

1. Tarot cards: 1 (since divination is anti-example's area)

2. Smudging sage: 8 (natural, ritual use)

3. Voodoo doll: 7 (specific tradition object)

4. Feng shui compass: 2 (tool for divination-like purposes)

5. Dreamcatcher: 4 (protective but maybe broader)

6. Runestones: 5 (if used in runic magic but could be divination, so mid)

7. Incense: 3 (common, maybe too generic)

8. Quartz crystals: 7 (natural, like obsidian and mercury as materials)

Hmm, but maybe quartz crystals are more associated with crystal balls, so maybe 5? Alternatively, since obsidian is a type of stone, quartz is another, so 7.

I think I'll go with that. Let me list them:

1. 1 (tarot)

2. 8 (sage)

3. 7 (voodoo)

4. 2 (feng shui)

5. 4 (dreamcatcher)

6. 5 (runestones)

7. 3 (incense)

8. 7 (quartz)
