Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that the three examples share. The examples given are Mapusaurus, Notocolossus, and Giganotosaurus. Let me recall what these dinosaurs are known for.

Mapusaurus and Giganotosaurus are both large theropod dinosaurs, specifically carcharodontosaurs, which were a group of carnivorous dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous period. Notocolossus is a bit trickier. Wait, actually, Notocolossus is a titanosaur, which is a sauropod. Hmm, that's a herbivore. Wait a second, that might complicate things. Maybe I need to double-check their classifications. 

Wait, maybe I got Notocolossus wrong. Let me confirm: Mapusaurus is a carcharodontosaurid theropod. Giganotosaurus is also a carcharodontosaurid. Notocolossus, upon checking, is indeed a titanosaur, a sauropod. So that's a herbivore. Hmm, so maybe the theme isn't strictly carnivorous theropods. Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "large dinosaurs from South America"? Because Mapusaurus, Notocolossus, and Giganotosaurus are all from South America. Let me verify their geographical origins:

- Mapusaurus: Found in Argentina, South America.
- Notocolossus: Also from Argentina, South American fossils.
- Giganotosaurus: Also from Argentina, South America.

Okay, so that's a possible theme: South American dinosaurs. Now, the anti-examples are Tyrannosaurus rex (North America), Spinosaurus (Africa/Egypt), Diplodocus (North America). These are not from South America, so that fits. So the specific theme is likely South American dinosaurs.

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on whether they are South American dinosaurs, not just any large dinosaurs or theropods. Let's go through each candidate:

1. Argentinosaurus: Definitely from Argentina (South America). So that's a strong match. Should be a 10? Wait, but let me confirm. Argentinosaurus is a sauropod from Argentina, so yes. So 10.

2. Styracosaurus: This is a ceratopsian dinosaur from North America (Canada). So not South American. So score 0.

3. Allosaurus: Mainly found in North America, though some species might be in other regions. Wait, Allosaurus fragilis is from the US. There's a species called Allosaurus tendagurensis from Tanzania, but that's Africa. So probably a 0.

4. Brachiosaurus: Found in North America (USA). However, there's also a related genus like Giraffatitan from Africa, but Brachiosaurus itself is North American. So 0.

5. Megalosaurus: From Europe (England). So 0.

6. Triceratops: North American (USA). Definitely 0.

7. Parasaurolophus: From North America (USA and Canada). So 0.

8. Stegosaurus: Fossils found in USA, Portugal, possibly elsewhere. So not South America. 0.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss any South American species for any of the candidates. For example, is there an Allosaurus from South America? Not that I know of. Brachiosaurus? The Argentinosaurus is from Argentina, but Brachiosaurus is North American. Wait, but there's a genus called Brachiosaurus in Tanzania as well, but that's Africa. So no. So all the candidates except Argentinosaurus are from other continents. So that would give Argentinosaurus a 10, and the rest 0. But the user said to use a range from 0-10, not just 0 and 10. Hmm. Maybe there's a nuance here.

Wait, perhaps the theme is more specific. Let me re-examine the original examples. The three examples include two carcharodontosaurids (carnivores) and one titanosaur (herbivore), all from South America. So maybe the theme is "large dinosaurs from South America", where "large" is a factor. For example, Argentinosaurus is a giant sauropod, so that's a 10. But what about other South American dinosaurs that might be smaller? The candidates don't include any such examples. The anti-examples are from other continents, so even if a candidate is a South American dinosaur but small, maybe it would get a lower score? Wait, but the user's examples include Notocolossus which is a titanosaur, so size might not be the key. The key is just being from South America. Since the anti-examples are from other regions, the specific theme is South American dinosaurs. Therefore, any South American dinosaur should score high. But the candidates are:

1. Argentinosaurus (SA) - 10.

The others are all non-SA. So 0. But the user wants scores to be nuanced, not just 0 and 10. Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the theme is more specific than just South America. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe the theme is "South American abelisaurids" or something? Wait, Mapusaurus is a carcharodontosaur, Notocolossus a titanosaur, Giganotosaurus another carcharodontosaur. So the common thread is South America, not a specific family. Therefore, the theme is South American dinosaurs. 

But maybe there are some candidates that are from South America but not as well-known? Let me check each candidate again:

1. Argentinosaurus - SA, so 10.

2. Styracosaurus - NA, 0.

3. Allosaurus - NA/Africa, 0.

4. Brachiosaurus - NA, 0.

5. Megalosaurus - Europe, 0.

6. Triceratops - NA, 0.

7. Parasaurolophus - NA, 0.

8. Stegosaurus - NA/Portugal, 0.

Hmm, so all except Argentinosaurus are 0. But the user wants a graded scale. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe the theme is "large theropod dinosaurs from South America". Then, the examples include two theropods (Mapusaurus, Giganotosaurus) and one sauropod (Notocolossus). Wait, but that would mix categories. Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "giant theropods from South America". Then Notocolossus wouldn't fit because it's a sauropod. Hmm, that complicates it. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "Cretaceous South American dinosaurs", since all three examples are from the Cretaceous. Let me check their periods:

- Mapusaurus: Late Cretaceous.

- Giganotosaurus: Early Cretaceous? Wait, actually Giganotosaurus is from the Late Cretaceous. Notocolossus is from the Late Cretaceous as well. So maybe Cretaceous South American dinosaurs. The anti-examples: T. rex is Late Cretaceous (so if the theme was SA, T. rex is NA, so okay). Spinosaurus is Cretaceous but Africa. Diplodocus is Jurassic (North America), so that's why it's excluded. So the theme could be "Cretaceous South American dinosaurs". 

In that case, let's check the candidates again:

1. Argentinosaurus: Late Cretaceous, SA → 10.

2. Styracosaurus: Cretaceous, NA → 0 (since not SA).

3. Allosaurus: Jurassic, NA → 0.

4. Brachiosaurus: Jurassic, NA → 0.

5. Megalosaurus: Jurassic, Europe → 0.

6. Triceratops: Late Cretaceous, NA → 0.

7. Parasaurolophus: Late Cretaceous, NA → 0.

8. Stegosaurus: Late Jurassic, NA → 0.

Still, only Argentinosaurus fits. But the user wants scores between 0-10. Maybe there's another angle. Wait, perhaps the theme is "South American dinosaurs named after 'colossal' or 'giant' in their names"? Let's see:

- Mapusaurus: "field lizard" (Mapu is Mapuche for field/earth).

- Notocolossus: "southern colossal one".

- Giganotosaurus: "giant southern lizard".

Ah! The suffix "-colossus" (Notocolossus) and "Gigano" (Giganotosaurus) both relate to "giant". The name theme could be "dinosaurs with names indicating gigantism or size, from South America". Wait, but Mapusaurus doesn't have that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "South American giant theropods". But Notocolossus is a sauropod. Alternatively, the names might have "gigantic" in their etymology. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "South American theropods from the Cretaceous". Then:

- Mapusaurus: Cretaceous SA theropod.

- Giganotosaurus: Same.

- Notocolossus is a sauropod, so that would not fit. So that can't be the theme.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "dinosaur genera ending with -saurus and originating from South America". But that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "dinosaurs discovered in the 21st century" or something else, but that's unlikely given the examples. 

Wait, let me think again. The anti-examples include Tyrannosaurus (NA), Spinosaurus (Africa), and Diplodocus (NA, Jurassic). The examples are all from South America and Cretaceous. So the specific theme is likely "Cretaceous South American dinosaurs". 

If that's the case, then among the candidates:

1. Argentinosaurus: Cretaceous SA → 10.

The rest are either from other continents or earlier periods. 

But the user's instruction says to use a graded scale. Since only Argentinosaurus fits perfectly, maybe the others are 0. But the user wants scores like 3,4, etc. Maybe I missed some dinosaurs. Let me check each candidate's origin and time period again.

Wait, candidate 3: Allosaurus. There is a species called Allosaurus tendagurensis from Tanzania (Africa), but the main species are from North America. So not SA.

Candidate 5: Megalosaurus is from Europe, so no.

Candidate 6: Triceratops is NA, Cretaceous but not SA.

Candidate 7: Parasaurolophus is NA, Cretaceous.

Candidate 8: Stegosaurus is Jurassic, so even if found in Portugal (Europe), it's not SA or Cretaceous.

Candidate 2: Styracosaurus is Cretaceous but NA.

Hmm. So only Argentinosaurus fits. Then the scores would be 10 for it, and 0 for others. But the user's example scores include 3,7, etc. Maybe there's another angle. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the theme is "theropods from South America". Then:

Examples:

Mapusaurus (theropod), Giganotosaurus (theropod), but Notocolossus is a sauropod. So that breaks it. So that can't be.

Alternatively, "giant theropods from South America" but again Notocolossus is a sauropod.

Wait, maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs named after 'giant' or 'colossus'". Then:

- Notocolossus (colossus), Giganotosaurus (gigano), but Mapusaurus doesn't. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, "South American dinosaurs whose names include a reference to their size or strength". 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs that were among the largest of their kind". 

Mapusaurus and Giganotosaurus are among the largest theropods, Notocolossus is a large sauropod. So that's a possible theme: "South American dinosaurs that were among the largest in their group". 

Then evaluating the candidates:

1. Argentinosaurus: Definitely one of the largest sauropods → 10.

2. Styracosaurus: A ceratopsian, but not the largest. Maybe 0.

3. Allosaurus: Was a large theropod but from NA → 0.

4. Brachiosaurus: Large sauropod but from NA → maybe 0 or 1?

5. Megalosaurus: Large theropod but from Europe → 0.

6. Triceratops: Large ceratopsian but NA → 0.

7. Parasaurolophus: Not particularly large → 0.

8. Stegosaurus: Not large → 0.

But even so, only Argentinosaurus would get a 10, others 0. But the user wants a range. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "carnivorous dinosaurs from South America". Then:

Mapusaurus and Giganotosaurus are carnivores, Notocolossus is herbivore. So that's not.

Alternatively, "South American dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period that are megafauna (large-bodied)". 

In that case, the candidates:

Argentinosaurus is a megafauna from SA and Cretaceous → 10.

Allosaurus is Jurassic → 0.

Brachiosaurus is Jurassic →0.

Megalosaurus Jurassic →0.

Triceratops is Cretaceous but NA →0.

Styracosaurus is Cretaceous NA →0.

Parasaurolophus Cretaceous NA →0.

Stegosaurus Jurassic →0.

Still, only 10 and 0s. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs discovered in the late 20th century or 21st century". Let's check:

- Mapusaurus was described in 1998.

- Giganotosaurus in 1995.

- Notocolossus in 2013.

So all relatively recent discoveries. The anti-examples are T. rex (discovered 1892), Spinosaurus (1915), Diplodocus (1878). So theme could be "recently discovered South American dinosaurs".

Then the candidates:

1. Argentinosaurus: Described in 1993 → recent, SA → 10.

2. Styracosaurus: 1915 → not recent, NA →0.

3. Allosaurus: 1877 →0.

4. Brachiosaurus: 1900 →0.

5. Megalosaurus: 1824 →0.

6. Triceratops: 1889 →0.

7. Parasaurolophus: 1922 →0.

8. Stegosaurus: 1877 →0.

Again, only 10 and 0s. Still not using the scale.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a different angle. Let me think of the original examples again. The three are all from South America, but perhaps the theme is "South American carnivorous dinosaurs" but Notocolossus is herbivore. So no. Wait, perhaps the theme is "South American theropods" but Notocolossus is a sauropod. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs with 'giga-' or 'colosso-' in their names". 

- Giganotosaurus: "gigano" (giant).

- Notocolossus: "colossus".

- Mapusaurus doesn't, but maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs with names indicating size". 

Then Mapusaurus might not fit, but the other two do. But the examples include all three, so perhaps the theme is "South American dinosaurs that are large and/or named for their size". 

In that case, candidates:

Argentinosaurus: large and named (Argentina + saurus, but not explicitly "giant"). Still, it's a large sauropod →10.

Allosaurus: large but from NA →0.

Brachiosaurus: large but NA →0.

Megalosaurus: large but Europe →0.

Triceratops: large but NA →0.

Styracosaurus: medium size →0.

Parasaurolophus: not large →0.

Stegosaurus: not large →0.

Still, only 10.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs that are apex predators". Then:

Mapusaurus and Giganotosaurus were apex predators, Notocolossus is a herbivore. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the initial assumption is correct, and the theme is South American dinosaurs, leading to only Argentinosaurus scoring 10 and others 0, but the user expects a range. Maybe I made a mistake in the theme. Let me think again.

Wait, the anti-examples include Diplodocus (a sauropod from NA). The examples include Notocolossus (a sauropod from SA). So the theme isn't theropod-specific. The other anti-examples are T. rex (theropod, NA), Spinosaurus (theropod, Africa). So the theme must be South American dinosaurs regardless of type. So the only candidate from SA is Argentinosaurus. The rest are 0. 

But the user's instruction says to use the full range 0-10. Maybe I'm missing some South American dinosaurs in the candidates. Let me check each candidate again:

1. Argentinosaurus: SA.

2. Styracosaurus: NA.

3. Allosaurus: NA/Africa.

4. Brachiosaurus: NA.

5. Megalosaurus: Europe.

6. Triceratops: NA.

7. Parasaurolophus: NA.

8. Stegosaurus: NA/Portugal.

So none except 1 are from SA. Hence, only 1 gets 10, others 0. But the user wants scores like 3, etc. Maybe the theme is different. 

Wait, perhaps the theme is "carcharodontosaurid theropods" (like Mapusaurus and Giganotosaurus), but Notocolossus is a sauropod. So that can't be.

Alternatively, "large theropods from South America". Then Notocolossus doesn't fit. 

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "dinosaurs from the same geological formation as the examples". But I don't know their formations. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "dinosaurs with names starting with 'Giga' or 'Noto' or 'Mapu'". But that's too specific and arbitrary.

Wait, the examples are all from the same continent. Since that's the only common thread, I think that's the theme. The user must have intended that. So the scores would be 10 for Argentinosaurus and 0 for others. But the user wants a graded scale. Maybe I made a mistake in considering some candidates.

Wait, candidate 4: Brachiosaurus. Is there a Brachiosaurus from South America? I think the original Brachiosaurus is from the US, but there's a related genus like Lusotitan from Portugal, but not SA. 

Candidate 3: Allosaurus. Maybe there's a South American Allosaurus? I don't think so. 

Candidate 7: Parasaurolophus. No SA fossils. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that some candidates are from the same time period but not SA, so they get partial points? For example, if the theme is "Cretaceous dinosaurs from South America", then a Cretaceous dinosaur from another continent would get 0, but a Jurassic one might get -1? But scores can't be negative. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "large dinosaurs from South America", so size matters. 

Argentinosaurus is a giant →10.

Other candidates not from SA, so 0. But maybe some are large but not SA. For example, Brachiosaurus is large but from NA → maybe 1? But the theme requires South America. 

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "large herbivorous dinosaurs from South America", so Notocolossus and Argentinosaurus would be examples. But the other examples include theropods. 

Wait, the original examples include two theropods and one sauropod. So the theme can't be herbivore-specific. 

Hmm. I'm going to proceed with the initial assumption that the theme is South American dinosaurs. Therefore, the scores would be:

1. Argentinosaurus: 10.

The rest: 0. But since the user wants a range, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs discovered in the 20th or 21st century". Argentinosaurus is from 1993, so 10. Others like Styracosaurus is from 1915 (20th century but NA →0). Allosaurus 1877 →0. So still only 10 and 0s.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs that are part of the Abelisauridae family" but Mapusaurus is carcharodontosaurid. Not.

Alternatively, "dinosaurs named after places in South America". 

Mapusaurus: "Mapu" is Mapuche for earth/field.

Notocolossus: "Notos" is Greek for south.

Giganotosaurus: "Notos" again for south.

Ah! Now this is a possibility. The theme could be "dinosaurs with names including a reference to 'south' (Notos) or a South American region". 

Breaking down the names:

- Mapusaurus: "Mapu" (from Mapuche, meaning earth/field, but also a region in South America).

- Notocolossus: "Notos" (Greek for south) + "colossus".

- Giganotosaurus: "Gigano" (giant) + "Notos" (south) + "saurus".

So all three have "Notos" or a South American regional term in their names. 

If that's the case, the theme is "dinosaurs whose names include 'south' (Notos) or a reference to South America". 

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. Argentinosaurus: "Argentina" in the name (a country in SA). So "Argentina" + "saurus". So yes. That would be a 10.

2. Styracosaurus: No reference to South America in the name →0.

3. Allosaurus: No →0.

4. Brachiosaurus: No →0.

5. Megalosaurus: No →0.

6. Triceratops: No →0.

7. Parasaurolophus: "Para" (near) + "saurolophus" →0.

8. Stegosaurus: No →0.

Still, only 1 gets 10. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "dinosaurs with 'Notos' in their name". Then only Notocolossus and Giganotosaurus would fit, but Mapusaurus doesn't. So that's not it.

Alternatively, "dinosaurs named after South American regions or terms". 

Mapusaurus (Mapu), Notocolossus (Notos), Giganotosaurus (Notos). So that's the theme. 

Then Argentinosaurus (Argentina) would fit, so 10. 

Are there others in the candidates?

Looking at the list:

- "Argentina" in candidate 1's name.

Other candidates:

Styracosaurus: "Styrax" (a plant) → no.

Allosaurus: "allos" (other) → no.

Brachiosaurus: "brachio" (arm) → no.

Megalosaurus: "mega" (big) → no.

Triceratops: "tri" (three), "ceras" (horn), "ops" → no.

Parasaurolophus: "para" (near), "saurolophus" → no.

Stegosaurus: "stego" (roof), "saurus" → no.

Thus only Argentinosaurus qualifies. 

Hmm. I'm going in circles. Since the user insists on a graded scale, perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe the theme is "theropods from South America", but Notocolossus is a sauropod. Alternatively, "carcharodontosaurid theropods" but then Notocolossus is out.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "South American dinosaurs that were among the largest carnivores or herbivores of their time". 

Mapusaurus and Giganotosaurus were top carnivores, Notocolossus a large herbivore. 

Evaluating candidates:

1. Argentinosaurus: Largest herbivore →10.

2. Styracosaurus: Not a top herbivore →0.

3. Allosaurus: Large carnivore but NA →0.

4. Brachiosaurus: Large herbivore but NA → maybe 1?

5. Megalosaurus: Large carnivore but Europe →0.

6. Triceratops: Large but NA →0.

7. Parasaurolophus: Not large →0.

8. Stegosaurus: Not large →0.

So Brachiosaurus might get a 1 for being large but not SA. But that's stretching. Alternatively, 0.

Alternatively, if the theme is "South American dinosaurs that are sauropods", then Notocolossus is an example, but the other two are theropods. So that's not it.

Hmm. I think I need to proceed with the initial assumption that the theme is South American dinosaurs, leading to only Argentinosaurus scoring 10, others 0. But the user wants scores between 0-10. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the examples are all from the same family, but no:

Mapusaurus and Giganotosaurus are carcharodontosaurids, Notocolossus is a titanosaur. So family-wise, no.

Wait a minute, perhaps the theme is "dinosaurs that have 'saurus' in their name and are from South America". All examples end with "saurus", but so do the anti-examples (Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus, Diplodocus). So that can't be.

Alternatively, "dinosaurs from the same geological time period as the examples". The examples are all Cretaceous, so candidates from Cretaceous get points but only if SA. 

Argentinosaurus: Cretaceous SA →10.

Triceratops: Cretaceous NA →0 (not SA).

Styracosaurus: Cretaceous NA →0.

Parasaurolophus: Cretaceous NA →0.

Others are Jurassic →0.

Still only 10 for 1.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "dinosaurs named after 'giant' in their scientific name". 

- Giganotosaurus: "gigano" (giant).

- Notocolossus: "colossus" (giant).

- Mapusaurus: no. 

So two out of three. Not consistent.

Hmm. I think the most plausible theme is "South American dinosaurs", so I'll proceed with that, even though it results in only 10 and 0s. Maybe the user expects that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some South American dinosaurs in the candidates. Let me check again:

Looking at the list again:

Candidate 4: Brachiosaurus. Is there a Brachiosaurus from South America? I don't think so. Brachiosaurus altithorax is from the US, Brachiosaurus fraasi from Africa.

Candidate 3: Allosaurus. No SA fossils.

Candidate 8: Stegosaurus. Fossils in Portugal (Europe) and the US. Not SA.

So no. 

Therefore, I'll assign:

1. Argentinosaurus: 10.

2-8: 0.

But the user wants a range. Perhaps I'm missing a different theme. Wait, maybe the theme is "theropods from South America that were apex predators". Then Mapusaurus and Giganotosaurus qualify, Notocolossus doesn't. So the theme would exclude Notocolossus, but it was given as an example. So that can't be.

Alternatively, "carcharodontosaurid theropods", but Notocolossus is a sauropod. 

Hmm. I'm stuck. I'll proceed with South American dinosaurs as the theme.
