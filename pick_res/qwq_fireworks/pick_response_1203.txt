Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the given examples. The examples are a salmon dying after spawning, a tadpole losing its tail when becoming a frog, and a caterpillar turning into a butterfly. 

Hmm, so all three involve a transformation or significant change in the organism's life cycle, leading to a different stage or end of life. The key points here might be biological transformations that are natural, intrinsic to the species' life cycle, and often involve a radical physical change or death post-transformation. 

Now the anti-examples are things like a car being scrapped, a building demolished, or tech upgrades. These are external, human-driven processes, not natural biological changes. So the theme isn't about things being discarded or replaced by humans, but more about natural life cycles and biological metamorphosis.

Now looking at the candidates:

1. **Bridge closed for safety**: This is a human decision based on wear and tear. It's not a natural biological process. So probably a low score, maybe 2 or 3. It's more like the anti-examples.

2. **Species going extinct due to environmental changes**: Extinction is a broader concept. While it's natural, it's not part of the species' normal life cycle. The examples are about individual organisms, not entire species. So maybe a 4? Not exactly matching the individual life cycle transformation.

3. **Language evolving and losing words**: This is a cultural/social change, not biological. Similar to the anti-examples which involve human-made things changing. Probably a low score, like 1 or 2.

4. **Seed losing coat after germinating**: Germination is part of a plant's life cycle. The seed's coat is shed as the plant grows. This seems very close to the examples. High score, maybe 8 or 9. It's a natural, biological transformation leading to a new stage.

5. **Snake shedding skin**: Snakes shed their skin periodically as part of growth. This is a natural, repetitive biological process. The examples are one-time transformations (spawning, metamorphosis). But shedding skin is a key part of their life cycle. Maybe a 7 or 8. It's a transformation but recurring, not a single event leading to a new form.

6. **Star collapsing into a black hole**: This is an astronomical event, not biological. Though it's a natural process, it's not related to life cycles of organisms. So a 0 or 1. Definitely an anti-example type.

7. **Tradition fading with society**: Again, cultural change, not biological. Similar to language, so maybe 2 or 3.

8. **Person retiring after career**: Retirement is a human social construct, not a biological life cycle stage. Though it's a life stage, it's more institutional than a natural biological transformation. Maybe a 4 or 5? Not as strong as the examples but has some life stage aspect.

Wait, let me reassess. The examples are all about the organism undergoing a transformation (death or metamorphosis) as part of their natural life cycle. The key is that the transformation is intrinsic, biological, and leads to a new stage or end of life. 

For candidate 5 (snake shedding skin), even though it's recurring, it's a natural part of growth. Maybe that's closer. The caterpillar's chrysalis is a one-time event leading to a butterfly. Shedding skin is regular but still a necessary part of the life cycle. Maybe 7?

Seed losing coat is definitely 9 or 10. Let me check the examples again. The examples all result in a new form (death is the end, but part of the life cycle). The seed becoming a plant is exactly like that. So maybe 10 for 4?

But the original examples have the organism itself transforming (salmon dies, tadpole becomes frog, caterpillar becomes butterfly). The seed isn't the same organism, but part of the plant's life cycle. Hmm, maybe 8 because it's the seed's transformation into a plant, but the seed itself is not the organism, it's part of the plant's growth. 

Alternatively, maybe 9 because it's a necessary step in the plant's life cycle. 

Candidate 8 (retirement) is a social role change, not biological. So 3 or 4.

Candidate 2 (species extinction) is about the entire species, not an individual's life cycle. So maybe 3.

Candidate 6 (star) is definitely 0.

Let me list them again with possible scores:

1. Bridge: 2 (external, human decision)
2. Species extinction: 3 (not individual, but natural process)
3. Language: 1 (cultural, not biological)
4. Seed: 9 (biological life cycle transformation)
5. Snake: 7 (natural but recurring, not a one-time metamorphosis)
6. Star: 0 (non-biological)
7. Tradition: 2 (cultural)
8. Retirement: 4 (social, not biological)

Wait, but maybe snake shedding skin is a better fit. Let me think again. The examples are about a significant life stage change. Shedding skin is a regular occurrence but part of growth. The caterpillar's chrysalis is a major one-time event. So snake's skin shedding is a periodic event but still a necessary part of its life cycle. So maybe 7 is okay.

Seed germination is a perfect example, so 9 or 10. Since the original examples are all 10s, maybe 9 because it's part of plant's life, but the seed itself isn't the organism yet? Or maybe 10. Hmm. The seed turning into a plant is analogous to the tadpole to frog. So maybe 10.

But the user said not to state the theme. Let me see the anti-examples are about human-made things being discarded. So if the seed is a natural process, it's a good fit. So 10?

Wait the user's examples all involve the same organism transforming. The seed isn't the same organism, but the plant is a new stage. Maybe it's still a 9. 

Okay, final scores:

1. 2

2. 3

3. 1

4. 9

5. 7

6. 0

7. 2

8. 4

But let me check if there's any other nuances. For candidate 8 (retiring), maybe a 3? Since it's a life stage but not biological. 

Alternatively, maybe 4 is okay. 

Candidate 7 (tradition fading) is 2, same as bridge. 

I think that's reasonable. Let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating. The key is the biological life cycle transformation. So:

1. Bridge: 2

2. Species extinction: maybe 3 (since it's a natural process but on a species level, not individual)

3. Language: 1 (cultural)

4. Seed: 9

5. Snake: 7

6. Star: 0

7. Tradition: 2

8. Retirement: 4 (personal life stage, but not biological transformation)
