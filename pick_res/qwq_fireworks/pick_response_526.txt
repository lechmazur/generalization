Okay, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to understand the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are all about urban road cleaning machines, automated sidewalk cleaners, and street sweepers with rotating brushes. The anti-examples are industrial floor scrubbers, car wash systems, and home robotic vacuums. 

The key here is to focus on the specific theme. The examples are all related to outdoor, public spaces like streets and sidewalks, using rotating brushes for debris collection. The anti-examples are in different contexts: industrial floors, car washing, and home use. So the theme is specifically about outdoor, municipal, or public infrastructure cleaning with rotating brushes, not for industrial, home, or other specialized uses like pools or gutters.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Automated carpet cleaner with rotating brushes: Carpets are usually indoor, like in homes or offices. The anti-example includes home use, so this is probably a 0 or low score.

2. Industrial dust collector with rotating brushes: The anti-example mentions industrial floor scrubbers, so industrial use is broader. This might be a 0 or 1.

3. Automated gutter cleaning system with a rotating brush: Gutter cleaning is a specific task. It's outdoor but not exactly roads or sidewalks. Maybe a 3 or 4? Since gutters are part of buildings, maybe not the exact theme.

4. Municipal street cleaner with a front-mounted rotating brush: This directly mentions municipal street cleaning, which is exactly the examples given. So a 10?

5. Snow plow with a rotating brush for snow removal: Snow plows are street equipment, but the primary function is plowing, and the rotating brush might be for debris. Not sure. Maybe 7 or 8? Since it's for streets but snow removal might be a different primary function than debris collection.

6. Pool cleaner robot with a rotating brush: Pool maintenance is a different environment. The anti-examples include home use, but pools are more specialized. Probably a low score, like 1 or 2.

7. Conveyor belt system with rotating brushes for cleaning: Conveyor belts could be in factories or other industrial settings. Not public streets, so maybe 0 or 1.

8. Automated graffiti removal system using rotating brushes: Graffiti removal on public structures might be part of urban maintenance. Not exactly street sweeping but related. Maybe a 4 or 5? Since it's public but not roads.

Wait, let me reassess each one again carefully:

1. Carpet cleaner: Definitely home or commercial interior. Anti-example includes home use, so 0.

2. Industrial dust collector: Industrial context, which is broader than the specific urban public space theme. So 0 or 1.

3. Gutter cleaning: Outdoor but not roads/sidewalks. Maybe 3? Since it's a different type of cleaning but still outdoor.

4. Municipal street cleaner: Exact match. 10.

5. Snow plow with brush: The examples include debris collection. Snow plow's primary is snow, but the brush might help with debris. Maybe 7? Since it's on streets but the main purpose is different.

6. Pool cleaner: Not related to streets. 0 or 1.

7. Conveyor belt cleaning: Industrial, so 0.

8. Graffiti removal: Public structures but not roads. Maybe 4? It's urban maintenance but not exactly street sweeping.

Hmm. Let me check the anti-examples again. The anti-examples are industrial floor scrubbers (industrial), car wash (automotive), and home vacuum. So the theme is strictly outdoor public areas like streets and sidewalks. So any device used in those areas would be a match. 

Candidate 3: Gutter cleaning systems are for buildings' gutters, not roads. So maybe 2.

Candidate 5: Snow plow with rotating brush for debris. Since it's on the street, even if for snow, the brush part might still be for debris. So maybe 8? Because it's a street tool, even if primary function is snow. The examples don't specify the debris type, just debris collection. So maybe higher.

Candidate 8: Graffiti removal on public walls. Not roads, so maybe 3? 

Wait, the examples are all about cleaning the road/sidewalk surface. Graffiti is on structures, so not matching. So 2 or 3.

Let me assign scores:

1. 0 (home carpet)
2. 0 (industrial)
3. 3 (gutter cleaning, outdoor but not road)
4. 10 (exact)
5. 8 (snow plow on street, uses brush for debris)
6. 0 (pool)
7. 0 (industrial)
8. 2 (graffiti on structures, not road)

Wait, maybe 5 is 7 instead of 8? Because snow removal is different from debris, but the brush is for debris. Not sure. Maybe 7 is okay.

8. Graffiti is more like a different task, so 2.

Yes, that seems consistent.
