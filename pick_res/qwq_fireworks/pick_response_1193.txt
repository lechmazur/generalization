Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that connects the examples given: a jigsaw puzzle, a wishbone, and a piñata. Then, I have to consider the anti-examples: mosaic, collage, quilt. The task is to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not the broader or related ones that the anti-examples might represent.

Starting with the examples. A jigsaw puzzle is a collection of pieces that fit together to form a whole image. A wishbone is a single bone that's traditionally broken by two people making a wish, so it's about splitting into parts but originally a single item. A piñata is an object filled with treats, often broken open to release them. Hmm, maybe the theme is about items that are broken apart or have parts that are separated to achieve something? Alternatively, maybe it's about items that are assembled or have parts that come together? Wait, a jigsaw puzzle is assembled, a wishbone is broken apart, and a piñata is broken open. So maybe the commonality is that each involves breaking or the act of breaking apart to reveal or achieve something. 

Alternatively, perhaps it's about items that have parts which are meant to be separated or used in a way that involves separation. The anti-examples are mosaic, collage, quilt. Those are all about assembling separate pieces into a whole, but maybe the specific theme is about items that are meant to be broken apart (like a piñata or wishbone) or have pieces that are separated (like a jigsaw puzzle, which is separated but then reassembled). Wait, but jigsaw puzzles are assembled, but they start as separate pieces. The wishbone is broken into pieces, and the piñata is broken open. So maybe the theme is items that involve breaking apart or the separation of parts as part of their primary use or function. 

The anti-examples are things that are assembled from parts but don't involve breaking. A mosaic is pieces glued together, a collage is glued, a quilt is sewn together. So the specific theme might be items that are designed to be broken apart, or where the act of breaking is central to their use. 

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. Stained glass window: Typically made by assembling pieces of glass, often in a frame. It's assembled but not broken. So maybe it's more like a mosaic, which is an anti-example. So probably a low score.

2. Tapestry: Usually woven or made of interlaced threads, but could also be a collage-like thing. If it's woven, it's a single piece, but maybe made of multiple threads. But since tapestries are assembled (like a collage), it might be an anti-example, so low score.

3. Fractal pattern: A geometric shape that repeats at different scales. Doesn't involve breaking or parts that are separated. It's a pattern, so maybe a 0?

4. Constellation: A group of stars seen as a pattern. They are separate stars but not broken apart. But maybe the idea is that constellations are "assembled" in the sky? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe constellations are formed by connecting stars, but that's more like a jigsaw? Not sure. Hmm.

5. Patchwork blanket: Like a quilt, which is an anti-example. So definitely low score, maybe 0 or 1.

6. Mural: A large painting on a wall. It's a single piece, not made of parts. So maybe a 0?

7. Kaleidoscope: Creates patterns through reflection and broken glass pieces inside. The glass pieces are broken, and when you turn it, they rearrange. The broken pieces are part of its function. This seems closer to the theme. The broken glass inside is essential, so maybe a high score, like 8 or 9?

8. Sand mandala: A temporary ritual artwork made of sand, which is later destroyed. The destruction is part of its meaning, so the act of breaking or dismantling is central. This might fit the theme of items meant to be broken apart, so maybe a 7 or 8?

Wait, let me reassess the theme again. The examples are jigsaw (pieces that fit together, but start as separate), wishbone (broken), piñata (broken open). The key might be that all three are objects that are either broken apart as part of their use or have parts that are separated (like jigsaw pieces). The anti-examples are things assembled without breaking. So the theme could be "objects that involve the separation or breaking of parts as part of their primary function".

So for each candidate:

1. Stained glass: assembled, not broken. Anti-example. 0-2.

2. Tapestry: woven, assembled. Anti. 0-2.

3. Fractal: no breaking. 0.

4. Constellation: not physical, doesn't involve breaking. 0-1.

5. Patchwork: like quilt, assembled. 0.

6. Mural: single surface. 0.

7. Kaleidoscope: has broken glass pieces inside, essential to function. So breaking is part of the design. High score, maybe 8 or 9.

8. Sand mandala: created and then destroyed (broken apart). The destruction is part of the ritual, so fits the theme. Maybe 7-9?

Wait, but the wishbone and piñata are broken by users, while the sand mandala is destroyed intentionally. Maybe that's a good fit. Kaleidoscope's pieces are already broken and then rearranged. So both involve broken parts. 

So scoring:

1. Stained glass window: 0 or 1. Since it's assembled, maybe 1 because it's made of pieces but not broken as part of use.

2. Tapestry: 0 or 1.

3. Fractal: 0.

4. Constellation: 0.

5. Patchwork: 0.

6. Mural: 0.

7. Kaleidoscope: 9.

8. Sand mandala: 8.

Wait but maybe sand mandala is closer? Since it's destroyed, which is an active breaking. The piñata is broken open to release contents, wishbone is broken by pulling. The sand mandala is dismantled as part of its ritual, so maybe even better fit. So maybe 9 for kaleidoscope (because the broken glass is part of its structure) and 9 for sand mandala? But the examples include jigsaw which is assembled, so maybe the theme isn't only about being broken but also having parts that are separated (like jigsaw puzzle pieces are separated but then joined). Hmm. 

Alternatively, the theme is items that have parts that are separated either to be used (like jigsaw pieces to assemble, wishbone pieces when broken, piñata when broken open releases parts). So the key is that the object's function involves separation of parts either by breaking or assembling. 

So kaleidoscope has broken glass pieces that move when you turn it, so the broken pieces are essential. That's a strong fit. Sand mandala is created and then destroyed, so the destruction (breaking apart) is part of its use. 

Patchwork is anti, so 0. 

Stained glass: pieces are assembled but not broken as part of the function. So low. 

So:

1. 1

2. 1

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 9

8. 8

Wait, maybe sand mandala is 9? Or kaleidoscope is 10? Let's see. 

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "items that are broken apart or have parts that are separated as part of their primary use". 

Jigsaw is assembled from separated pieces (so separation is part of the process). Wishbone is broken into pieces (separated). Piñata is broken open to release contents (separated). 

So the key is that the object's primary use involves separation of parts either by breaking or by being in pieces that are put together. 

Thus, kaleidoscope uses broken glass pieces, so that's part of its function. Sand mandala is created and then destroyed (separated into sand). 

So sand mandala's destruction is part of its purpose, so that's a strong fit. 

Kaleidoscope's broken glass is part of how it works, so also a strong fit. 

So maybe both 9 and 9? But need to differentiate. 

Alternatively, the jigsaw is assembled, but the anti-examples include mosaics which are assembled. Wait the anti-examples are mosaics, collages, quilts. So the theme is not just things that are made of pieces, but specifically those where the pieces are separated as part of their use (like jigsaw requires the pieces to be separated first, then assembled). The wishbone is broken into parts, piñata is broken open. 

So maybe the key is that the object is designed to be broken apart or have parts that are meant to be separated, not just assembled. 

Thus, kaleidoscope's broken glass is part of its design, so that's a strong fit. 

Sand mandala is made to be destroyed, so that's a fit. 

So both could be high, like 9 and 8? Maybe kaleidoscope is 10? Wait but the examples don't have a 10, but the task allows up to 10. 

Alternatively, the sand mandala is more about destruction as part of its purpose, similar to piñata and wishbone. 

Kaleidoscope's function relies on the broken glass pieces moving, so the broken pieces are essential. 

So maybe both are 9. 

Alternatively, perhaps the sand mandala is created and then dismantled, so the dismantling is part of the ritual. That's similar to the piñata being broken open. So maybe 9. 

Kaleidoscope's function is based on the broken pieces, so maybe 10. 

Wait, but the examples are all physical objects that are broken or have parts to be separated. The kaleidoscope's pieces are already broken when it's made. So it's part of its structure, so it fits. 

Hmm. Let's try to assign scores now.

1. Stained glass window: assembled, so like anti-examples. 1.

2. Tapestry: assembled. 1.

3. Fractal: no parts, just a pattern. 0.

4. Constellation: not physical, just stars. 0.

5. Patchwork: anti-example. 0.

6. Mural: single piece. 0.

7. Kaleidoscope: 9 (broken pieces essential).

8. Sand mandala: 8 (destroyed, but maybe slightly less direct than kaleidoscope? Or maybe 9? Maybe I should make it 9. Hmm.)

Alternatively, the sand mandala is an exact fit because it's intentionally destroyed, similar to a piñata. So 10? But the examples didn't have a 10. Wait the examples are the given ones, but the task allows up to 10. 

Alternatively, since the examples include a jigsaw which starts as pieces, maybe the sand mandala is created as a whole and then broken down. So it's part of its use. 

Perhaps kaleidoscope is 9, sand mandala 9 as well. But since I have to differentiate, maybe 9 and 8.

Alternatively, let's see:

- The highest possible is 10. Maybe kaleidoscope gets 10, sand mandala 9.

But I think the key is that the theme is about the separation or breaking as part of the object's function. 

Another thought: jigsaw puzzle pieces are meant to be separated and then assembled. The wishbone is broken apart. The piñata is broken open. So the common theme is that the object's primary function involves the separation of parts either through breaking or through being in pieces. 

Thus, anything where the object's use requires breaking or having parts that are separated counts. 

Kaleidoscope: the broken glass pieces are part of its design, so yes. 

Sand mandala: destroyed as part of its ritual, so yes. 

So both are high. 

Now, how to differentiate. Maybe sand mandala is 9 and kaleidoscope 10? Or the other way. 

Alternatively, maybe the sand mandala is more like the piñata (destroyed to release something?), but sand is released, so maybe better fit. 

Alternatively, kaleidoscope's function is to have the pieces move, so the separation is essential. 

Hmm. Let's go with:

1. 1

2. 1

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 9

8. 8

But maybe sand mandala is 9. Alternatively, maybe 9 and 9. But the instructions say to use the full range, so let's spread them a bit. 

Alternatively, the sand mandala is created and then destroyed, which is a key part, so maybe 9, and kaleidoscope is 10? 

Alternatively, since the examples include a jigsaw which is assembled from pieces, perhaps the sand mandala is more about destruction, so it's similar to the wishbone and piñata, so higher. 

Hmm. I think I need to settle on some scores. Let's do:

1. 1

2. 1

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 9

8. 8

That way, there's a range from 0 to 9, using the full scale. Alternatively, maybe 10 for kaleidoscope. Let me think again. 

The specific theme is: objects that involve separation or breaking as part of their primary function. 

Kaleidoscope's function is entirely dependent on the broken glass pieces moving, so that's a perfect fit (10). 

Sand mandala is created and then destroyed, which is part of its purpose, so that's a 9. 

Others are lower. 

So final scores:

<number>1</number><score>1</score>

<number>2</number><score>1</score>

<number>3</number><score>0</score>

<number>4</number><score>0</score>

<number>5</number><score>0</score>

<number>6</number><score>0</score>

<number>7</number><score>10</score>

<number>8</number><score>9</score>

Wait but the instructions said not to use just 0s and 10s, but to spread out. But in this case, I have a 10 and 9. Maybe that's okay. Alternatively, if I think kaleidoscope is 9 and sand mandala 8. 

Alternatively, maybe the sand mandala is more aligned with the examples. Let me think of the wishbone: it's a single object broken into two. The piñata is a container broken open. The jigsaw is pieces assembled. 

The sand mandala is a structure created and then destroyed. The destruction is part of its use. So that's similar to the piñata being broken open. 

Kaleidoscope uses broken glass but it's part of its structure, not that it's destroyed. The breaking happens during its creation, but it's not part of its use (you don't break it again). Whereas the piñata is broken when used. 

So maybe sand mandala is a better fit (9), kaleidoscope 8. 

Hmm, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the object has parts that are meant to be separated (either by breaking or assembling). 

A jigsaw puzzle's pieces are separated and then reassembled. 

A wishbone is broken into parts. 

A piñata is broken open to release parts (the treats inside). 

So the common theme is that the object is designed to have parts that are separated either through breaking or through assembly/disassembly. 

Thus, kaleidoscope has pieces (broken glass) that are separated and moved, so that's part of its function. 

Sand mandala is destroyed, so the parts are separated. 

So both are high. 

Maybe kaleidoscope is 9, sand mandala 9, but since I have to differentiate, let's say kaleidoscope 9 and sand mandala 8. 

Alternatively, the sand mandala's destruction is a key part of its purpose, so higher. 

I think I'll go with:

1. 1

2. 1

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 9

8. 8

That uses the range up to 9. Maybe that's acceptable. The instructions say to use the full range, so including 0 and up to 9. 

Alternatively, maybe 10 for kaleidoscope. Let me think again. 

The examples include a jigsaw, which is pieces that are separated and then assembled. The kaleidoscope has pieces that are already separated (broken glass) and part of its design. So that's a perfect fit, so 10. 

Sand mandala is also a good fit but maybe slightly less because it's destroyed rather than having parts that are used in a different way. 

Alternatively, the sand mandala's destruction is part of its use, so maybe 10. But I need to decide. 

Perhaps the best is to give kaleidoscope 10 and sand mandala 9. 

Final decision:

<number>1</number><score>1</score>

<number>2</number><score>1</score>

<number>3</number><score>0</score>

<number>4</number><score>0</score>

<number>5</number><score>0</score>

<number>6</number><score>0</score>

<number>7</number><score>10</score>

<number>8</number><score>9</score>
</think>

<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>0</score>
<number>6</number><score>0</score>
