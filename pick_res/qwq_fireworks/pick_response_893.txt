Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate each candidate based on how well they fit the specific theme from the examples, not the broader ones. The examples all have three elements: a historical setting (medieval Florence, ancient Athens, 18th-century Paris), a character facing existential dread, and the city's political/social turmoil mirroring that dread.

First, the anti-examples are things that might have existential questions but not dread, or are in modern/futuristic settings. So I need to check each candidate against the three criteria: historical setting, existential dread, and the city's turmoil linked to the character's angst.

Starting with candidate 1: dystopian future city, societal collapse but no dread. The setting isn't historical, and it lacks existential dread. So probably low score, maybe 2? But wait, the examples are all historical. Dystopian is future, so definitely not matching the historical aspect. So maybe 0 or 1? The societal collapse is similar to the political turmoil, but without dread and wrong time period. Hmm, maybe 1 or 2. Let's see others first.

Candidate 2: 19th-century Vienna, protagonist grapples with meaninglessness (existential dread?), against cultural flourishing. The time period is historical, and "meaninglessness of life" sounds like existential dread. The city's cultural backdrop might mirror the angst. So this seems like a good fit. Maybe 8 or 9? Wait, the examples have political turmoil. Vienna's cultural flourishing is different from political turmoil, but maybe the cultural aspect is the turmoil? Not exactly. But the main elements are there except maybe the type of turmoil. Still, the key points are historical setting and existential dread. So maybe a 7 or 8.

Candidate 3: memoir in 19th-century Vienna, personal growth without dread. Historical setting, but no dread. So that's an anti-example. So score 0 or 1? Since it's historical but lacks dread, definitely low. Maybe 1?

Candidate 4: 20th-century London, anxiety but not dread. The time is historical (20th century is recent, but still historical?), but anxiety vs. existential dread. The examples specify existential dread. So even if the setting is somewhat historical, the lack of dread drops it. Maybe 3? The setting is close but not the same as the examples (medieval, ancient, 18th century). 20th century might be considered more modern. Hmm, maybe 2?

Candidate 5: fantasy city with existential questions but not dread. The setting isn't a real historical place, it's mythical. Plus no dread. So that's two strikes. 0 or 1.

Candidate 6: fictional city, philosophical concepts not related to dread. No historical setting, no dread. So 0.

Candidate 7: modern Tokyo, existentialism without historical setting. The anti-examples include modern settings, so this is a direct anti-example. Score 0.

Candidate 8: post-apocalyptic city, survival issues, no dread. Again, not historical, and no dread. So 0 or 1.

Wait, let me recheck each:

1. Dystopian future (non-historical), societal collapse (similar to turmoil?), but no dread. Since the theme requires existential dread and historical setting, this misses both. Maybe 1?

2. 19th-century Vienna (historical), meaninglessness (dread), cultural flourishing (maybe as a form of societal context). Close. The examples had political turmoil, but cultural flourishing could be a different kind of backdrop. Still, the core elements are there except maybe the turmoil type. So maybe 7 or 8. Let's say 7.

3. 19th-century Vienna but no dread. So historical but no dread. 1.

4. 20th-century London, anxiety (not dread). The time is a bit modern compared to the examples (medieval, ancient, 18th). So maybe 2? Because the setting is somewhat historical but not as old as examples, and anxiety isn't dread.

5. Fantasy city, no dread. 0.

6. Fictional, non-historical, no dread. 0.

7. Modern Tokyo, no history. 0.

8. Post-apocalyptic (non-historical), no dread. 0 or 1. Maybe 1 because it's a city setting, but no dread and not historical.

So final scores:

1: 1

2:7

3:1

4:2

5:0

6:0

7:0

8:1

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Let me see if any need adjustment. Maybe candidate 1's societal collapse is closer to political turmoil, so maybe 2 instead of 1? Candidate 4's anxiety might be close to dread but not exactly, so maybe 3. Let me think again.

Candidate 1: The societal collapse is similar to political turmoil (like the examples), but the setting is future, and no dread. So maybe 2 points (since two elements missing: setting and dread). The examples require both historical setting and existential dread. So candidate 1 has neither, so 0? Wait, the anti-examples include futuristic cities without dread. So candidate1 is like the first anti-example. The first anti-example got 0, so candidate1 would be 0? Wait the anti-examples are not to be matched, so if the candidate is exactly like an anti-example, it should be 0. But in the anti-examples, the first one is a film in futuristic city with existential questions but not dread. Candidate1 is a graphic novel with societal collapse (not existential questions). So maybe it's worse. Hmm, maybe 1?

Alternatively, maybe the key is that the examples have existential dread and historical setting. So any missing either gets a low score. Candidates that have historical setting but no dread: 3 and maybe 2 (if "meaninglessness" is considered dread). Wait, candidate2's "meaninglessness of life" is existential dread. So candidate2 has both elements. The only difference is that the city's context is cultural flourishing instead of political turmoil. The examples' cities had political turmoil, but maybe cultural flourishing is a different aspect. However, the key elements are historical setting + existential dread. The city's turmoil is part of the theme, but perhaps the main points are the setting and the dread. So candidate2 might be a 8 or 9. Wait the examples had the city's turmoil mirroring the dread. So if the city's cultural flourishing is the backdrop but not necessarily the turmoil, maybe that's less. So maybe 7.

Candidate4: 20th century (historical?), but anxiety instead of dread. So maybe 3. Since the setting is somewhat historical but the emotional aspect is off. 

Candidate8: post-apocalyptic, which is not historical. So 0.

Wait, maybe I was too harsh on candidate2. Let me re-express the theme from the examples:

Each example has:

- A specific historical setting (medieval, ancient, 18th century)

- A character facing existential dread

- The city's political/social turmoil mirrors the character's internal state.

So the three components are:

1. Historical setting (specific time period, not modern/future)

2. Existential dread (not just anxiety or existential questions without dread)

3. The city's external turmoil that parallels the character's internal struggle.

Therefore, the candidates need to have all three to get a high score.

Now re-evaluating:

Candidate1: Futuristic (no 1), societal collapse (mirroring turmoil?), but no dread (no 2). So 0 or 1.

Candidate2: 19th century (1 yes), existential dread (yes), cultural flourishing as backdrop. But the cultural flourishing isn't turmoil. So maybe the third element is missing. The examples had political turmoil. So maybe this only has two elements. So maybe 6? Since two out of three.

Candidate3: 19th century (1 yes), no dread (0 on 2), so 0 or 1.

Candidate4: 20th century (arguably historical but closer to modern), anxiety (not dread). So 0 on 2, and 1 maybe on 1? If 20th is considered historical, then partial on 1. So maybe 2.

Candidate5: Mythical city (no 1), existential questions but not dread (no 2). 0.

Candidate6: Fictional (no 1), no dread (no2), so 0.

Candidate7: modern (no1), no dread (no2). 0.

Candidate8: post-apocalyptic (no1), no dread (no2). 0.

So adjusting based on three elements:

Candidate1: 0 (no 1 and 2), but societal collapse is turmoil (part of 3?), but since 1 and 2 are missing, maybe 1? Because the turmoil is there but without the historical setting and dread. Not sure.

Alternatively, if the three elements are all required, then any missing drops the score. Let's try a scoring where each element is worth ~3-4 points.

For candidate2:

Elements:

1. Historical (19th century): yes (3 points)

2. Existential dread (meaninglessness): yes (3 points)

3. City's turmoil mirrors it: cultural flourishing is not turmoil, so maybe 0 here. So total 6, so score 6 or 7?

Alternatively, maybe cultural flourishing is a form of societal context, but not turmoil. So maybe partial on 3. Maybe 2 points. So total 8?

Hmm, this is tricky. The examples specifically mention political turmoil. So unless the cultural flourishing is a form of turmoil, like maybe it's a period of rapid change or something, but the description just says "cultural flourishing". So maybe it's not turmoil. Thus, candidate2 gets 2 out of 3 elements. So maybe 6 or 7.

Alternatively, if the key is the presence of both historical setting and existential dread, with the city's situation reflecting the internal struggle, even if the turmoil isn't political. Maybe the cultural aspect can mirror the dread in another way. So maybe 8?

This is a bit ambiguous. To avoid overcomplicating, perhaps candidate2 is a strong match except for the third element, so maybe 7.

So final scores:

1. 1 (missing 1 and 2, but has societal turmoil? Not sure, maybe 1)

2. 7 (has 1 and 2, but maybe not 3)

3. 1 (has 1 but not 2)

4. 2 (has partial 1, lacks 2)

5. 0

6. 0

7. 0

8. 0

Alternatively, maybe candidate1's societal collapse as turmoil (element3) but without historical setting and dread. So 1 point.

Candidate4: 20th century might be considered historical, so element1 is there (3), but anxiety (not dread) so element2 missing (0). So 3? But I thought earlier 2. Hmm, maybe 3.

Wait, let's think of a scale where each element is 3-4 points. Let's try:

Each element (historical, dread, turmoil) is worth ~3-4 points.

For candidate2:

Historical: yes (3)

Dread: yes (3)

Turmoil: not exactly, so maybe 1. Total 7.

Candidate4: 

Historical (20th century): maybe 2 (since it's closer to modern than the examples)

Dread: no (0)

Turmoil: anxiety's context might be part of city's issues? Not sure, but no. So 2.

Candidate1:

Historical: 0

Dread:0

Turmoil (societal collapse as turmoil): maybe 2? But no historical or dread. So 2?

Wait, but the user's examples have all three elements. So if a candidate has only turmoil but no other elements, it's worse. Maybe candidate1 gets 1.

Hmm, this is getting too detailed. Let's proceed with the initial thought.
