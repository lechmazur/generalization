Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, first, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are plywood, lasagna, and semiconductor chips. The anti-examples are stack of books, stack of papers, and filing cabinet. 

Hmm. Let me think. The examples: plywood is a material made by layering wood veneers. Lasagna is a layered dish with pasta, sauce, cheese, etc. Semiconductor chips are layered materials in their construction. So maybe the theme is "layered structures" or "things made by layering components"?

The anti-examples are stack of books, stack of papers, filing cabinet. A stack of books is layers, but maybe they're just physical stacks, not a constructed or manufactured item. Similarly, a filing cabinet is for storing papers, which are stacked, but again, maybe the key difference is that the examples are objects where the layers are integral to their function or structure, while the anti-examples are just containers or stacks used for storage. 

So the specific theme is probably layered items that are either constructed with multiple layers as part of their essential structure or function, not just items that are stacked for storage. 

Now looking at the candidates:

1. Storage boxes: These are containers, maybe like filing cabinets. They might hold things but aren't layered themselves. So probably a low score, maybe 1-3?

2. Deck of cards: A deck is a stack of cards. But similar to the anti-examples which are stacks. However, a deck is a functional unit where the layers (cards) are part of the deck's use. Maybe higher than storage boxes? Maybe 5-6? But since the anti-examples include stacks, maybe it's a 4 or so?

3. Wedding cake: Typically has multiple layers. That's a classic example of layers in structure. So this should be a high score, maybe 8 or 9?

4. Sandwich: Definitely has layers (bread, fillings, etc.). So that's a strong candidate. 9 or 10?

5. Photo album: It's a collection of photos stored in pages. The pages might be layers, but similar to the anti-examples which are storage items. So maybe lower, like 3?

6. Earth's atmosphere: The atmosphere has layers like troposphere, stratosphere, etc. So that's a natural layered structure. The examples include both man-made (plywood, chips) and maybe natural (lasagna is food, but layered). So maybe 7-8?

7. Parking garage: Has multiple levels (layers) but again, maybe similar to stacks. But a parking garage is a structure built in layers. Hmm. The anti-examples are about storage, but parking garage is a structure. Maybe 5-6?

8. Tool chest: A container with compartments, maybe not layers. More like a box with sections. So similar to storage boxes. 2-3?

Wait, let me recheck. The anti-examples are stack of books (physical stack), stack of papers (same), filing cabinet (storage). So the key difference is that the examples are items that are themselves composed of layers as part of their essential structure or function, not just containers that hold things in layers. 

So sandwich is layers of ingredients, yes. Wedding cake is layers of cake and frosting. Semiconductor chips have semiconductor layers. Plywood is layers of wood. Lasagna is layers of pasta, sauce, cheese. 

Earth's atmosphere's layers are natural and part of its structure. So that's a good fit. 

Deck of cards is a stack but each card is a separate item. But maybe the deck as a whole is a layered structure? Not sure. It's a collection of individual cards, so maybe less so. 

Parking garage has levels but they're separate floors, not layered in the same way. So maybe lower. 

Tool chest is a container, so similar to filing cabinet, so low. 

Photo album is pages, which are like layers but again, storage. 

So let's assign scores:

1. Storage boxes: 1 (since they're storage like anti-examples)
2. Deck of cards: 4 (stack but functional unit, but maybe not as integral as lasagna)
3. Wedding cake: 9 (definite layered structure)
4. Sandwich: 10 (layers are essential)
5. Photo album: 2 (storage)
6. Earth's atmosphere: 8 (natural layers, but not man-made like the examples)
7. Parking garage: 5 (multiple levels but structural, not layered materials)
8. Tool chest: 1 (container)
Wait, but the scores need to be spread out. Let me check again:

Wait, the examples include both natural (atmosphere?) No, semiconductor chips, plywood, lasagna. Lasagna is a food, so natural ingredients but constructed. So Earth's atmosphere's layers are natural but maybe still counts. 

Wedding cake is a constructed layered item, so 9 or 10? Maybe 9 since it's food like lasagna. 

Sandwich is 10. 

Deck of cards: Maybe 3? Because it's a stack but not a layered structure in the same way. 

Parking garage: Maybe 4. 

Photo album: 2. 

Storage boxes: 1. 

Tool chest: 1. 

Earth's atmosphere: 7? Hmm. Since it's layers but not man-made. The examples have both man-made (plywood, chips) and food (lasagna). Atmosphere is natural but not a product. Maybe 6? 

Hmm, need to ensure spread. Let me try another pass:

1. Storage boxes: 1 (definitely anti-example-like)
2. Deck of cards: 3 (stack, but functional as a deck)
3. Wedding cake: 9 (layers like lasagna)
4. Sandwich: 10 (layers essential)
5. Photo album: 2 (storage)
6. Earth's atmosphere: 7 (layers exist but natural, not constructed)
7. Parking garage: 4 (structural layers but not part of the object's composition)
8. Tool chest: 1 (container)

This seems better. Let me check if the scores use the full range. The highest is 10 (sandwich), then 9,7,4,3,2,1,1. Maybe parking garage could be 5? Hmm. Alternatively, Earth's atmosphere could be 8. Let me see:

Alternatively, Earth's atmosphere's layers are well-defined and part of its structure. So maybe 8. 

So final scores:

1. 1

2. 3

3. 9

4.10

5.2

6.8

7.5

8.1

Yes, that uses more of the range. Let me confirm each:

Storage boxes: 1 (storage container, like anti-examples)

Deck of cards: 3 (stack but not a layered composite)

Wedding cake:9 (layered food)

Sandwich:10 (layers essential)

Photo album:2 (storage, pages aren't layers in the same way)

Earth's atmosphere:8 (natural layers, but not constructed like examples but still layered structure)

Parking garage:5 (levels but structural, not material layers)

Tool chest:1 (container)

That seems reasonable. I'll go with that.
