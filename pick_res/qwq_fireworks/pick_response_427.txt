Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided examples and anti-examples, and I need to determine how well each candidate matches the specific theme. 

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is from the examples given. The examples are:

1. A pen with a hidden compartment for small items like microfilm.
2. A hollowed-out book with a secret compartment for valuables.
3. A belt buckle with a hidden space for cash.

The anti-examples are:

1. A strongbox with a key.
2. A locked diary with a key.
3. A locked gun safe.

The key difference between the examples and anti-examples seems to be that the examples all involve **concealed or hidden compartments** that aren't obvious at first glance. The anti-examples, while secure, are more straightforward in their purpose (like a strongbox or safe), and their primary function isn't to hide something in a disguised manner. The anti-examples use locks and keys but are not disguised as everyday objects with hidden functions.

So the specific theme here is: **Everyday objects that have a concealed or hidden compartment for storing items, where the primary appearance of the object doesn't reveal the hidden function.**

Now, evaluating each candidate against this theme:

1. **A safe deposit box at a bank.**  
   This is a secure storage space in a bank, but it's not disguised as something else. It's explicitly a safe, so it's more like the anti-examples. Score: 0 or 1. But maybe 1 since it's a storage space, but not hidden in an everyday object. Hmm, maybe 0?

2. **A jewelry box with a lock.**  
   A jewelry box is meant for storing jewelry, and adding a lock makes it secure. However, the lock is part of its primary function, not a hidden compartment. It's more like the anti-examples (locked containers). So probably low score, maybe 2.

3. **A file cabinet with a padlock.**  
   Again, a file cabinet's purpose is to store files. Adding a padlock secures it but doesn't hide the contents. This is similar to the anti-examples. Score: 1 or 2.

4. **A wall clock with a false back for hiding documents.**  
   This fits the theme perfectly. A wall clock's primary function is telling time, but the hidden compartment is a concealed feature. This is exactly like the examples. Score: 10.

5. **A locked drawer in a desk.**  
   A desk drawer is expected to have things stored in it. Even if locked, it's part of the desk's function, not a hidden compartment. So similar to anti-examples. Score: 1 or 2.

6. **A traditional piggy bank.**  
   A piggy bank is designed to hold money, but it's not a hidden compartment. The opening is usually obvious (like a slot). However, some might argue the entire pig itself is a "concealed" container, but traditionally, it's straightforward. Maybe 3? It's a bit in between.

7. **A locked suitcase.**  
   Suitcases are meant for carrying items, and locks are common. The contents are not hidden in a concealed compartment but stored openly. So this is like the anti-examples. Score: 0 or 1.

8. **A briefcase with a combination lock.**  
   Briefcases are for carrying documents, and a lock secures them. The contents aren't hidden in a concealed compartment. This is more like the anti-examples. Score: 1 or 2.

Wait, but let me check again. For candidate 6, the piggy bank: the traditional one has a slot, so you put coins in, but you can't access without breaking it. Maybe that's a hidden compartment? But it's the primary purpose. Hmm. Maybe a 3? Not as good as the examples but a bit closer. 

Candidate 4 is definitely a 10. The others are mostly low. Let me adjust:

1. Safe deposit box: 0 (since it's a dedicated safe, not disguised)
2. Jewelry box: 1 (lock but not hidden compartment)
3. File cabinet: 1
4. Wall clock: 10
5. Locked drawer: 0 (part of the desk's function)
6. Piggy bank: 2 (since it's a container but not a hidden compartment in an unrelated object)
7. Suitcase: 0 (open storage)
8. Briefcase: 1 (secure but not hidden)

Wait, maybe the piggy bank is a 3? Because it's a container where you can't access the contents without breaking it, so maybe considered a hidden compartment? But the primary function is to store money, so maybe not. Hmm. I'll go with 2.

Final scores:

1. 0  
2. 1  
3. 1  
4. 10  
5. 0  
6. 2  
7. 0  
8. 1
