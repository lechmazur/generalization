Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user has given me three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to figure out the specific theme they're pointing to. Then, I have to evaluate each candidate on a scale from 0 to 10 based on how well they fit that exact theme, avoiding the broader or related themes that the anti-examples might represent.

First, let's look at the examples: Grace Hopper, Frances Allen, Barbara Liskov. All of these are women with notable contributions in computer science or technology. But the anti-examples include Fran Allen (who is actually the same person as Frances Allen, maybe a different spelling?), Margaret Hamilton, and Betty Holberton. Wait, but the anti-examples are supposed to not fit the specific theme but might fit a broader one. Hmm, maybe Fran Allen is a typo? Because Frances Allen is an example and Fran Allen is the same person? That might be a trick. Maybe the anti-examples are slightly different. Let me check each of the anti-examples:

- Fran Allen: That's the same as Frances E. Allen, so maybe that's a trick to see if I notice that. Since Frances Allen is an example, Fran Allen is the same person, so perhaps the anti-examples include a misspelling or alternative name, but that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user intended Fran Allen as a different person? Wait, no, Fran Allen is Frances Allen's common name. So perhaps the anti-examples are meant to include someone else. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, the anti-examples are listed as:

Anti-examples:
Fran Allen
Margaret Hamilton
Betty Holberton

But Frances Allen is an example, so Fran Allen is the same person. Maybe that's an error in the problem setup, but perhaps the user intended to have Fran Allen as an anti-example? Maybe a typo? Alternatively, perhaps the theme is about being a recipient of a specific award, like the Turing Award. Let me think about the examples:

- Grace Hopper: She received the National Medal of Technology, and was a computer scientist, helped develop COBOL.
- Frances Allen: She was the first female recipient of the Turing Award (2006) for contributions to compiler design.
- Barbara Liskov: She won the Turing Award in 2008 for work on programming languages and distributed computing.

So maybe the theme is "female recipients of the Turing Award"? Let's check the anti-examples:

- Fran Allen (same as Frances Allen, so she is a Turing Award winner, so that's confusing)
- Margaret Hamilton: She's known for Apollo Guidance Computer software, but didn't win the Turing Award. She did get the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but not Turing.
- Betty Holberton: One of the original programmers of ENIAC, but no Turing Award.

Wait, but Frances Allen is an example and Fran Allen is the same person, so that would mean the anti-example list includes someone who should be an example. That can't be. Therefore, perhaps the theme isn't Turing Award. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "female computer scientists who have a Ph.D. in computer science or related field and have made foundational contributions to programming languages or software." Let's see:

Grace Hopper had a Ph.D. in mathematics, worked on COBOL.
Barbara Liskov has a Ph.D. in computer science, known for CLU and OOP.
Frances Allen worked on compilers, has a degree in mathematics but maybe in computer science?

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "women who have won the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award". Let me check:

Grace Hopper herself is the namesake, but she won it posthumously? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "women who have been awarded the Turing Award". Let's verify:

Barbara Liskov (2008), Frances E. Allen (2006) are Turing Award winners. The third example is Grace Hopper—who didn't win the Turing Award, since it started in 1966 and she died in 1992. Wait, Grace Hopper was born in 1906, died 1992. The Turing Award was established in 1966. So she didn't receive it. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe the theme is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "women who have been Fellows of the ACM". All three examples are likely ACM Fellows, but so are the anti-examples. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the key is to look at the anti-examples. The anti-examples include Margaret Hamilton and Betty Holberton. Let's see:

Margaret Hamilton is known for Apollo Guidance Computer, and has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, but not the Turing Award. Betty Holberton was one of the original ENIAC programmers and worked on UNIVAC. 

So the examples (Grace Hopper, Frances Allen, Barbara Liskov) and anti-examples (Fran Allen same as Frances, Margaret Hamilton, Betty Holberton) might be pointing to something like "Turing Award winners" but Grace Hopper wasn't one. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "women who have made significant contributions to programming languages or software development, and have a doctoral degree." Let's see:

Grace Hopper had a Ph.D. in mathematics, worked on COBOL.

Barbara Liskov has a Ph.D. in computer science, worked on programming languages like CLU.

Frances Allen has a master's in mathematics, but worked on compilers.

Wait, maybe the doctoral degree is part of it. Let me check Frances Allen's education: She has a master's in mathematics from the University of Michigan, and a bachelor's from Queen's University. So no Ph.D. So that might not be it.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "women inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame." Let's check:

Grace Hopper was inducted in 1997.

Barbara Liskov was inducted in 2012.

Frances Allen was inducted in 2009.

Margaret Hamilton was inducted in 2016. Wait, but she's an anti-example. Hmm, that would conflict.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "women who have made foundational contributions to computer science and have a connection to MIT." Barbara Liskov was a professor at MIT, Grace Hopper was a mathematician with ties to Harvard and others, Frances Allen worked at IBM but maybe not MIT. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at their notable achievements:

Grace Hopper: COBOL, naval officer, first compiler.

Frances Allen: compiler optimization, first female Turing Award winner.

Barbara Liskov: CLU, Argus, key in object-oriented programming, Turing Award.

The common thread might be that all three are recipients of the Turing Award. Wait, Barbara and Frances are, but Grace Hopper wasn't. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the theme is "women who have won the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award (ACM)." Let me check:

Grace Hopper received the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award in 1969 (the first recipient?).

Frances Allen won the Turing Award, but maybe also the Lovelace award? Not sure. Alternatively, Barbara Liskov might have received it too. Wait, the Lovelace Award is given by the ACM, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "female computer pioneers who have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame" — no, that's too random.

Alternatively, maybe the key is their first names. Grace, Frances, Barbara— all have traditional female names, but the anti-examples include Margaret, Betty, which are also traditional. Not helpful.

Wait, let me think of another angle. The anti-examples include Fran Allen, which is the same as Frances Allen. So perhaps the anti-examples include misspellings or alternative names, so the user wants us to recognize that Fran Allen is actually Frances Allen, so the anti-example is a trick. But then why is she listed as an anti-example? Maybe the actual theme is something else.

Wait, perhaps the theme is "female computer scientists who have an asteroid named after them." Checking:

Grace Hopper has 7434 Hopper.

Frances Allen has 7435 Allen.

Barbara Liskov has 7436 Liskov.

Wait, that's interesting! All three examples have asteroids named after them with consecutive numbers. Let me confirm:

Yes, according to some sources, Grace Hopper has 7434 Hopper, Frances Allen 7435 Allen, Barbara Liskov 7436 Liskov. So that's a specific and very particular theme: having an asteroid named after them in the 7434-7436 range. The anti-examples:

Fran Allen (same as Frances Allen, so already in the examples, so that's a trick) but the other two:

Margaret Hamilton: I don't think she has an asteroid named after her. Betty Holberton: Same.

So the theme is "having an asteroid named in the 7434-7436 series." So the candidates need to be checked if they have an asteroid in that range.

Now, the candidates are:

1. Lynn Conway
2. Kathleen Booth
3. Ada Lovelace
4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller
5. Jean Sammet
6. Adele Goldberg
7. Mary Allen Wilkes
8. Radia Perlman

So need to see if any of them have asteroids in that range.

Let's check each:

1. Lynn Conway: She's known for contributions to VLSI and transgender advocacy. I don't recall an asteroid, but maybe? Let me think. Wait, there's an asteroid 7437 named after someone else? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps she has one. Alternatively, maybe not. Need to check.

2. Kathleen Booth: Early computer scientist, inventor of the assembler. I don't think she has an asteroid named after her.

3. Ada Lovelace: The first programmer, but she lived in the 19th century. There is an asteroid 7053 Lovelace, but not in the 7430s.

4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller: First American woman to earn a PhD in Computer Science. She might not have an asteroid named after her.

5. Jean Sammet: Developed FORMAC, a programming language. Maybe she has an asteroid? Not sure.

6. Adele Goldberg: Contributed to Smalltalk. Perhaps an asteroid?

7. Mary Allen Wilkes: Designed the first personal computer (LINC). Maybe?

8. Radia Perlman: "Mother of the Internet" for spanning tree protocol. She might have an asteroid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the only ones in the 7434-7436 are the examples. The anti-examples like Margaret Hamilton might have an asteroid in a different range, but Fran Allen is the same as Frances.

Given that the theme is having an asteroid named in that specific range, the candidates would get 0 unless they have one. Since I can't recall any of them except the examples, the scores would be 0. But maybe some have others.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the theme is "female computer scientists who have an asteroid named after them in the 7000s series". But the examples are 7434-7436. Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "female computer scientists who have an asteroid named after them in the 1990s (year of discovery?)", but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "female computer scientists who were awarded the Turing Award". Barbara Liskov (2008), Frances Allen (2006), but Grace Hopper didn't get it. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the theme is "female members of the National Inventors Hall of Fame". Let's check:

Grace Hopper was inducted in 1997.

Frances Allen in 2009.

Barbara Liskov in 2012.

Margaret Hamilton in 2016 (so she's an anti-example but is in the Hall of Fame, so that would conflict).

Hmm, but the anti-example includes her, so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "female computer pioneers who have a stamp issued in their honor". Not sure.

Alternatively, considering the asteroid idea, maybe the correct theme is indeed the asteroid numbers. Let me verify:

Checking online (as I can't actually browse, but from my existing knowledge):

- Grace Hopper: Asteroid 7434 Hopper.

- Frances E. Allen: Asteroid 7435 Allen.

- Barbara Liskov: Asteroid 7436 Liskov.

So that's a very specific theme: having an asteroid named after them with numbers 7434-7436. Therefore, the task is to rate the candidates on how well they match this exact theme, not a broader one like "female computer scientists with asteroids".

The anti-examples:

- Fran Allen: same as Frances, so already in the examples. So perhaps a trick to see if I notice.

- Margaret Hamilton: She has an asteroid named after her? Let me recall. I think she has one, maybe 7437? If so, then she would be in the same range but not part of the specific triplet. So she's an anti-example because she's in the same range but not the exact numbers.

- Betty Holberton: I don't think she has an asteroid named after her.

Thus, the theme is specifically the numbers 7434-7436.

Now, the candidates:

1. Lynn Conway: I believe she has an asteroid named after her. Let me think. Yes, there's an asteroid 7437 named after her. Wait, but that's 7437, which is outside the 7434-7436 range. So she would be a near miss but not exactly matching. So maybe a score of 1 or 2?

Wait, but the examples are exactly those three numbers. So if someone has 7437, they are in the same vicinity but not the exact numbers. Hence, not matching the specific theme. So Lynn Conway would get a low score, maybe 1 or 2.

2. Kathleen Booth: No asteroid in that range, probably 0.

3. Ada Lovelace: Her asteroid is 7053 Lovelace, so not in the 7400s, so 0.

4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller: Unlikely to have an asteroid here, so 0.

5. Jean Sammet: I don't think so, so 0.

6. Adele Goldberg: Not sure, but probably no, so 0.

7. Mary Allen Wilkes: Maybe not, 0.

8. Radia Perlman: She has an asteroid named after her, I believe. Let me recall. Yes, there's an asteroid named after Radia Perlman, but the number? I think it's 7693 Perlman. So that's outside the 7434-7436 range. So she would get a low score, like 1 or 2.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again:

Wait, perhaps the theme is "female computer scientists who have an asteroid named after them", regardless of the number. But the anti-examples include Margaret Hamilton, who might have an asteroid. If the examples are the three with the specific numbers, then the theme is specifically those numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and the theme is "female Turing Award winners". Let's recheck that:

Barbara Liskov and Frances Allen are Turing Award winners (2008 and 2006), but Grace Hopper wasn't. She died in 1992, and the Turing Award was first given in 1966, so she might not have been eligible. So that can't be the theme.

Hmm. This is tricky. The asteroid idea seems the most precise, but I need to proceed with that assumption.

Thus, the candidates:

1. Lynn Conway: 7437 → close but not exact. Score maybe 1.

2. Kathleen Booth: 0.

3. Ada Lovelace: 0.

4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller: 0.

5. Jean Sammet: 0.

6. Adele Goldberg: 0.

7. Mary Allen Wilkes: 0.

8. Radia Perlman: 7693 → 0, but maybe 1?

Wait, but if the exact theme is the three specific numbers, then anyone not in 7434-7436 gets 0. So Lynn Conway's 7437 is outside, so 0. Radia's 7693 is way off. So all candidates except the examples would get 0, but the anti-examples include Margaret Hamilton (7437?), which would be a 0.5? But the user said to use integers.

Wait, but the user said the anti-examples are supposed to not match the exact theme but might match a broader one. So if the theme is exactly those three numbers, then the anti-examples like Margaret (if she's 7437) would be in the same sequence but not the exact numbers, so they are anti-examples. So the candidates need to have exactly 7434-7436. Since none of the candidates are among those three (the examples are already given), all candidates would be 0. But the user said to use the full range, so maybe some have partial matches?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the asteroid numbers. Let me think again:

Wait, maybe the theme is "female computer scientists who have an asteroid named after them in the 7000s". The examples are 7434-7436. The anti-examples include Margaret Hamilton (7437?), so that's in the same range. So the theme would be the exact numbers, so only those three. Thus, all candidates get 0 except if any have those numbers.

But the candidates listed don't include those three, so all scores would be 0. But the user wants the full range, so perhaps some have higher scores? Maybe I need to consider other possible themes.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "female recipients of the Turing Award". The examples include Barbara and Frances (both winners), but Grace Hopper wasn't. So that's inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe "female computer scientists who have a doctoral degree in computer science or related field and have won a major award". But not sure.

Wait, another angle: The examples are all women who have a Wikipedia page with a "Computer science" category and have made significant contributions in programming languages or software, and have a specific award. Alternatively, maybe they are all in the SIGCSE Hall of Fame? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at the anti-examples:

Margaret Hamilton is known for Apollo Guidance Software and has a NASA Exceptional Service Medal, but not the Turing Award.

Betty Holberton was a key ENIAC programmer.

Fran Allen is Frances Allen.

So perhaps the theme is "female computer scientists who have won the ACM Turing Award". Then:

Examples:

Grace Hopper: No (she died before it was given out in the late 60s, she died in 1992, but the first Turing Award was in 1966. Wait, Grace Hopper was alive then. Hmm, maybe she was nominated but didn't win? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake here, but assuming the examples are correct, perhaps the theme isn't Turing Award.

Alternatively, the theme is "female computer pioneers with a Wikipedia page that lists them as having an asteroid named after them". But then the anti-examples like Margaret might also have one, making them not fit.

This is challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the asteroid number theory, even if it's a stretch, since it's the only specific pattern I can see.

Thus, the scores would all be 0 except if any candidate has one of those numbers. Since none do, all are 0. But the user wants the full range, so maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is "female computer scientists with a Wikipedia page that includes an image of a medal or award". But that's too vague.

Wait, another thought: The examples are all women who have a "Computer Science Hall of Fame" induction. Checking:

Grace Hopper: Yes, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.

Barbara Liskov: Also in the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

Frances Allen: Same.

But the anti-examples like Margaret Hamilton are also in that, so that's not it.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the theme is "women who have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame related to computing". Unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is their first names: Grace, Frances, Barbara. All have "a" in the second syllable? Not sure. Not helpful.

Alternatively, their last names: Hopper, Allen, Liskov. None share obvious letters, but maybe their last names end with vowels? No.

Alternatively, their contributions to programming languages: Grace Hopper (COBOL), Frances Allen (compilers), Barbara Liskov (CLU). The theme could be "pioneers in programming languages and compilers". Then the anti-examples include Margaret Hamilton (software engineering), Betty Holberton (ENIAC/UNIVAC), Fran Allen (same as Frances). So the candidates:

1. Lynn Conway: Worked on VLSI, not programming languages. Maybe 2.

2. Kathleen Booth: Assembler developer. Maybe 6 or 7? Since she created the first assembler.

3. Ada Lovelace: First programmer, wrote about Babbage's engine. Maybe 8 or 9? Since she's foundational.

4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller: First woman with a PhD in CS, but not sure about programming languages. Maybe 3.

5. Jean Sammet: Developed FORMAC (a programming language). So maybe 9.

6. Adele Goldberg: Smalltalk, so important in OOP. Maybe 8.

7. Mary Allen Wilkes: Designed LINC, early personal computer. Maybe 4.

8. Radia Perlman: Networking, spanning tree, not directly PLs. Maybe 2.

But this would require the theme being "pioneers in programming languages and compiler technology". Let's see if that fits:

Examples:

Grace Hopper (COBOL compiler work), Frances Allen (compiler optimization), Barbara Liskov (CLU, OOP). Yes.

Anti-examples:

Fran Allen (same as Frances, so yes, but listed as anti? Maybe mistake. Margaret Hamilton (software engineering but not PL), Betty Holberton (early programming, but more on hardware/software).

If that's the theme, then the scores would be as above. But the user's anti-examples include Fran Allen (same as Frances), which would conflict. So maybe the theme is "female recipients of the ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award". Let's see:

The Hopper Award is given to young computer professionals, but Grace Hopper herself was the namesake. Barbara Liskov received it in 1985. Frances Allen received it in 1985 as well? Not sure. Alternatively, the examples may have won it.

Alternatively, the theme is "female members of the National Inventors Hall of Fame". As mentioned, Grace Hopper (1997), Frances Allen (2009), Barbara Liskov (2012). The anti-examples:

Margaret Hamilton (2016) is also in the Hall, so she should be an example, but she's an anti-example. So that can't be.

Hmm. Given the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll go back to the asteroid idea, even if it's a bit of a stretch. Thus, all candidates get 0 except perhaps none. But since the user wants scores from 0-10, maybe some have partial relevance.

Alternatively, perhaps the theme is "female computer scientists who have a doctoral degree in computer science or a related field". Let's see:

Grace Hopper had a Ph.D. in mathematics.

Frances Allen had a master's in math.

Barbara Liskov has a Ph.D. in computer science.

So not all have doctorates in CS, so that's not it.

Alternatively, "female computer scientists who have made significant contributions to compiler technology". Grace Hopper worked on compilers, Frances Allen on compilers, Barbara Liskov on programming languages (which include compiler aspects). So that's a possible theme.

Then the candidates:

1. Lynn Conway: Not compiler-related → 1.

2. Kathleen Booth: Assembler (a type of compiler) → 8.

3. Ada Lovelace: Not compilers → 0.

4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller: Education, not compilers → 0.

5. Jean Sammet: FORMAC was a compiler for FORTRAN → 9.

6. Adele Goldberg: Smalltalk, which has a compiler → 7.

7. Mary Allen Wilkes: Designed LINC, which had an assembler → 6.

8. Radia Perlman: Networking, not compilers → 1.

This might be a better fit. Let's see the anti-examples:

Fran Allen is Frances Allen, so yes (compiler). Margaret Hamilton: Apollo software (not compiler). Betty Holberton: ENIAC, more on hardware and early programming, not compiler design. So they are anti-examples because they are not focused on compilers.

So if the theme is "contributions to compiler technology", then the scores would be:

1. Lynn Conway: 1 (VLSI, not compiler)

2. Kathleen Booth: 8 (assembler)

3. Ada Lovelace: 0

4. Sister Mary: 0

5. Jean Sammet: 9 (FORMAC compiler)

6. Adele Goldberg: 7 (Smalltalk compiler)

7. Mary Wilkes: 6 (LINC's assembler)

8. Radia Perlman: 1 (networking)

But I need to adjust based on how central their work is to compilers. Kathleen Booth's assembler was foundational, so maybe higher. Jean Sammet's FORMAC was a compiler for FORTRAN, so very relevant. Adele Goldberg's Smalltalk had a compiler, so important. Mary's LINC had an assembler, which is a compiler-like tool. So perhaps:

Kathleen Booth: 9?

Jean Sammet: 9-10.

But since the examples are all high, maybe:

1. Lynn Conway → 2

2. Kathleen Booth → 9

3. Ada → 0

4. Sister Mary → 0

5. Jean → 10

6. Adele → 8

7. Mary → 5

8. Radia → 1

But I need to ensure the scores are spread out. Alternatively, the exact theme is "female computer scientists who made foundational contributions to compiler technology and have a doctoral degree in a related field". Then:

Jean Sammet has a Ph.D. in mathematics (maybe), so she'd qualify. Frances Allen has a master's, so maybe not. Hmm, complicates.

Alternatively, ignoring the degree, just contributions.

Proceeding with this theme, the scores would be as follows, using the compiler focus:

1. Lynn Conway: 2 (not compiler-focused)

2. Kathleen Booth: 9 (assembler, foundational)

3. Ada Lovelace: 0 (not compiler)

4. Sister Mary: 0

5. Jean Sammet: 9 (FORMAC compiler)

6. Adele Goldberg: 7 (Smalltalk compiler)

7. Mary Allen Wilkes: 5 (LINC's assembler)

8. Radia Perlman: 1 (networking)

But the user's examples include Grace Hopper (COBOL compiler), Frances Allen (compiler optimization), Barbara Liskov (CLU compiler). So the candidates with compiler work get higher scores.

Thus, the scores would be:

1. Lynn Conway → 2

2. Kathleen Booth → 9

3. Ada → 0

4. Sister Mary → 0

5. Jean → 9

6. Adele → 8

7. Mary → 5

8. Radia → 1

But the user wants the scores to be granular. Alternatively, adjust:

Jean Sammet and Kathleen Booth might both get 9 or 10, but since the examples are 10, perhaps:

Jean Sammet: 10

Kathleen Booth: 9

Mary Allen Wilkes: 6 (assembler is part of compiler tech)

Adele Goldberg: 8

Mary Allen Wilkes: 5

Radia Perlman: 1

Lynn Conway: 2

Sister Mary: 0

Ada: 0

So the final scores would be:

1. Lynn Conway: 2

2. Kathleen Booth: 9

3. Ada Lovelace: 0

4. Sister Mary: 0

5. Jean Sammet: 10

6. Adele Goldberg: 8

7. Mary Allen Wilkes: 5

8. Radia Perlman: 1

But I need to ensure the scores are spread out. Alternatively, perhaps Jean Sammet gets 9, and Kathleen 8, but I think the assembler work is more foundational.

Alternatively, if the exact theme is "female computer scientists who have made significant contributions to the development of programming languages or compiler technology", then:

1. Lynn Conway: 2 (VLSI, not PL/compiler)

2. Kathleen Booth: 9 (assembler)

3. Ada: 0 (no compiler/PL work, just algorithms)

4. Sister Mary: 0

5. Jean Sammet: 10 (FORMAC, a compiler)

6. Adele Goldberg: 8 (Smalltalk)

7. Mary Allen Wilkes: 5 (assembler for LINC)

8. Radia Perlman: 1 (networking)

This seems plausible. I'll proceed with this.
