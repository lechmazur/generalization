Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user provided examples and anti-examples, and I need to evaluate the candidates based on a specific theme. First, I need to understand what the theme is from the given examples.

Looking at the examples:

1. "jalan" (walk) becomes "jalan-jalan" (walk around/stroll) in Indonesian. The pattern here is reduplication, where the root word is repeated with a hyphen, creating a different but related meaning.
2. "putih" (white) becomes "putih-putih" (whitish) in Malay. Again, reduplication, but this time it seems to create a diminutive or a less intense form.
3. "orang" (person) becomes "orang-orang" (people) in Indonesian. Here, reduplication is used for pluralization.

The anti-examples are "walked", "ran", "swam". These are all English past tense verbs. The key is that they don't follow the reduplication pattern but are instead inflected for tense. So the specific theme here is reduplication in Indonesian/Malay to form plurals, intensifiers, or related nuances, not just grammatical tense changes.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. "spoken" – This is the past participle of "speak" in English. It's an inflection, not reduplication. So this would be similar to the anti-examples. Probably a 0 or low score.
2. "sleeping" – Present participle. Again, an inflection, not reduplication. Low score.
3. "broken" – Past participle. Same as above. Low score.
4. "drinking" – Present participle. Inflection, not reduplication. Low score.
5. "eats" – Third person singular present. Inflection. Low score.
6. "went" – Past tense of "go". Inflection, not reduplication. Low score.
7. "kain (cloth) - kain-kain (cloths) in Malay" – Here, reduplication is used for plural. This matches the examples exactly. So this should be a 10.
8. "mice" – Plural of "mouse" through irregular inflection. Not reduplication. So low score.

Wait, but the user mentioned that anti-examples might follow a broader theme. Let me check again. The theme is specifically reduplication in Indonesian/Malay for plural, aspect, etc. The anti-examples are English verb tenses. So candidates that use reduplication in the same way as the examples should be high. 

Candidate 7 is exactly like the examples, so 10. The others are all English inflections except maybe "mice", which is an irregular plural but not reduplication. So all others except 7 get very low scores. But the user wants the scores to use the full range. Wait, maybe some candidates could be mid-range?

Wait, let me check again. The user says the anti-examples are not exact matches but can follow broader themes. So maybe some candidates are partially similar but not exact. For instance, if a candidate uses reduplication but in a different language or for a different purpose, maybe it's a 5 or something?

Looking again at the examples, they all are reduplication in Indonesian/Malay. The anti-examples are English verb forms. So the theme is specifically reduplication in Indonesian/Malay for plural, aspect, etc. So the only candidate that matches exactly is number 7. The rest are English words with inflections, which are anti-examples. But the user wants to use the full range, so maybe some have slight relevance?

Wait, perhaps "mice" as a plural form might be a 1? Because it's plural but not reduplication. "drinking" is a participle, same as anti-examples. The user said anti-examples are not exact but follow broader themes, so the candidates should be scored based on how close they are to the exact theme (reduplication in those languages for those purposes). So 7 is 10. The rest are 0 except maybe if any other uses reduplication but in a different way?

Looking at the candidates again:

Candidate 7 is the only one with reduplication in Malay, so that's 10.

The rest are all English inflected forms, so they should be 0. But the user said to use the full range. Wait, maybe some candidates could have reduplication in English but not exactly the same? Like "mice" isn't, but "sleeping" isn't either. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe "broken" is a past participle but maybe in some languages reduplication can indicate past? But in the examples, the theme isn't about tense. The examples include plural (orang), aspect (jalan-jalan as a stative?), and a color's intensity (putih-putih). So the theme is reduplication in Malay/Indonesian for those specific functions. 

Therefore, all the English forms are 0 except 7. But the user wants scores from 0-10, so maybe some get 1 or 2? Or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the anti-examples are walked, ran, swam. They are past tense, so inflection. The candidates include similar forms like "spoken", "sleeping", etc., so those are all anti-examples, so they should be 0. "eats" is present tense, same category. "went" is past tense. "mice" is plural but irregular. So all except 7 are 0. But the user wants to use the full range. Maybe the user expects some to be mid? Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the theme is reduplication in general, but the anti-examples are English verbs. So if a candidate is a reduplicated form in another language but not Malay/Indonesian, like "kain-kain", which is Malay, so that's 10. The others, like "mice" is not reduplication. So the rest are 0. But perhaps "mice" is a plural, so maybe 1? But the theme's examples use reduplication for plural. Since "mice" isn't reduplication, it's not. So maybe all others are 0 except 7. But the user says anti-examples can match broader themes. So maybe some candidates are closer to the broader theme but not exact. For example, plural forms in general (like "mice") could be a 1 or 2 because plural is part of the theme but not via reduplication. Similarly, "drinking" is a verb form but not reduplicated. 

Alternatively, maybe "broken" is a past participle but in some languages reduplication can indicate aspect, so it's a 1? But in the examples, the reduplication isn't about tense. The theme is specifically reduplication in Malay/Indonesian for those functions. So unless the candidate uses reduplication in that way, they don't score. Since all the English words don't use reduplication, they get 0 except 7. But the user wants scores from 0-10, so maybe I need to adjust. Perhaps "drinking" is a gerund, which is a noun form, but still inflection. Maybe some get 1? 

Alternatively, maybe the user expects that "mice" is a plural, so similar to "orang-orang", but not via reduplication, so a 2? Because it's plural but not the exact method. Similarly, "spoken" is a form that modifies the verb but not via reduplication. Maybe 1? So I can assign 0 to most, but some get 1 or 2. 

Let me see the exact instruction again: anti-examples do not match the specific theme but can match broader ones. The task is to evaluate candidates based on how well they match the specific theme, not the broader ones. So if a candidate matches a broader theme (like pluralization in any way) but not the specific (reduplication in Malay/Indonesian), it should score low. Only candidate 7 matches exactly. The rest are all English inflections or irregular plurals, so they get 0 except maybe "mice" as a plural but not reduplication, so 1? 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to consider that "drinking" is a verb form, but the theme's examples aren't about verbs. Wait, the first example is a verb (jalan -> jalan-jalan), but the second is an adjective (putih -> putih-putih), and the third is a noun (orang -> orang-orang). So the theme isn't restricted to a part of speech. The key is reduplication in those languages for those functions. So any reduplication in those languages for those purposes would score high. 

So candidate 7 is perfect. The rest are English, so 0. But maybe some of them are reduplicated in another way? Like "mice" isn't, but "sleeping" isn't. So I think all except 7 are 0. However, the user wants to use the full range, so perhaps I should give some a 1 or 2 if they have plural but not via reduplication. 

Alternatively, maybe "broken" is a past participle, which in some languages might be formed via reduplication, but in English it's not. So maybe 1. 

Hmm, this is tricky. Since the user emphasized that the anti-examples are not exact matches but can follow broader themes, perhaps some candidates are closer to the broader theme but not exact. For instance, "mice" is a plural form, so maybe a 1 because plural is part of the theme but not via reduplication. Similarly, "drinking" is a verb form but not reduplicated. 

Alternatively, maybe "drinking" is a gerund, which is a noun form, but that's not related. 

Alternatively, maybe "eats" is third person singular, which is an inflection, so similar to anti-examples, so 0. 

I think the safest way is to assign 10 to candidate 7, and 0 to all others. But the user said to use the full range. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the theme. Let me recheck the examples again:

The examples are all reduplication in Indonesian/Malay. The anti-examples are English verb tenses. So the theme is reduplication in those specific languages for those functions. Therefore, only candidate 7 matches exactly. The rest are English, so they are 0. But since the user wants scores from 0-10, perhaps I need to give some a 1. Maybe "mice" is 1 because it's plural but not reduplication, so slightly related. "drinking" as a verb form, maybe 1? But the anti-examples are already verb tenses. Maybe the user expects some scores in between, so I'll assign 0 to most, but maybe 1 for plural forms like "mice", and 0 for others. 

Alternatively, maybe "broken" could be 1 as a past participle, but that's similar to anti-examples. 

Hmm, maybe the user expects that "drinking" is a continuous form, but that's an inflection. I'll proceed with 10 for 7, and 0 for others. But since the user says to use the full range, perhaps I need to adjust. Maybe "drinking" is a 1 because it's a verb form, but not reduplicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that "sleeping" is a gerund, which is a noun, but not relevant. 

Wait, maybe the user's examples have reduplication to form a noun from a verb (jalan-jalan as a noun meaning stroll?), or an adjective from an adjective. The key is the structure. The anti-examples are just tense inflections. So any English word that's an inflected form gets 0, and only the Malay/Indonesian reduplication gets 10. 

Therefore, I think the correct scores are 10 for candidate 7 and 0 for the rest. But the user wants the full range, so maybe some get 1 or 2. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake and some candidates have reduplication. Let me check the candidates again:

Looking at the candidates:

1. spoken – English past participle. No reduplication.
2. sleeping – English present participle. No.
3. broken – past participle. No.
4. drinking – same as above.
5. eats – 3rd person singular. No.
6. went – past tense. No.
7. kain-kain – yes, reduplication in Malay for plural. 10.
8. mice – plural, but irregular, not reduplication. So 0.

So only 7 is 10. The rest are 0. But the user wants to use the full range. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the theme is not strictly reduplication but something else? Wait, let me re-express the examples:

jalan -> jalan-jalan: reduplication as a common way to form a noun from a verb, meaning a light-hearted or habitual action.

putih -> putih-putih: reduplication to form an adjective meaning 'somewhat white' or 'whitish'.

orang -> orang-orang: reduplication for plural.

So the theme is reduplication in Malay/Indonesian for plural, aspect, or intensification. The key is the morphological process of reduplication in those languages. The anti-examples are English verb tenses, which are inflectional.

Thus, only candidate 7 fits the theme. The rest are English inflections, so 0. 

However, the user might expect some variation. Maybe "mice" is 1 because it's a plural, even if not via reduplication. "drinking" is 0. So I'll proceed with:

1. 0

2. 0

3. 0

4. 0

5. 0

6. 0

7. 10

8. 0

But the user said to use the full range. Maybe some get 1? Maybe "mice" as a plural gets 1. Let me adjust:

8. mice: 1

Others remain 0. 

Alternatively, maybe "drinking" is 1 because it's a verb form, but that's an inflection. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe "broken" is 1 as a past participle, but same as anti-examples. 

Alternatively, maybe the user considers that "drinking" is a verb form that's a noun, but that's a stretch. 

I think the best way is to assign 10 to 7 and 0 to all others. Even though the user says to use the full range, maybe in this case, the correct answers are mostly 0 except 7. But the user might have intended some candidates to have mid-scores. 

Wait, looking at the anti-examples: "walked", "ran", "swam" are all past tense, which are inflections. The theme's examples use reduplication. So any English inflection is an anti-example and should score 0. The only one that's not English is 7, which is correct. So I'll go with that.
