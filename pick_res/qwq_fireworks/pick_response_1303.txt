Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to figure out the specific theme that connects the three examples given: lightning bolts, snowflakes, and romanesco broccoli. Then, I have to consider the anti-examples (crystal formations, sunflower heads, seashells) which are related but not exact matches. The key is to identify what makes the examples unique compared to the anti-examples.

Looking at the examples: 
- Lightning bolts: These are natural, dynamic, and have a branching or fractal-like structure.
- Snowflakes: They form intricate, symmetrical patterns, often with fractal geometry.
- Romanesco broccoli: This vegetable has a clear fractal pattern in its growth, with self-similar structures at different scales.

The anti-examples:
- Crystal formations: While they have repeating patterns, they might be more uniform or based on regular crystalline structures rather than fractal.
- Sunflower heads: They have a spiral pattern based on the Fibonacci sequence, which is related to phyllotaxis, but maybe not as strictly fractal?
- Seashells: These often exhibit logarithmic spirals, which are a type of fractal, but perhaps the anti-example here is because they are more about the spiral than strict self-similarity across scales?

Hmm, maybe the specific theme here is **fractal geometry**, where each part is a scaled-down version of the whole. Lightning bolts have branching patterns that repeat at different scales. Snowflakes have their dendritic patterns that branch similarly. Romanesco broccoli's cones are made of smaller cones ad infinitum. 

The anti-examples might not be strictly fractal. Crystal formations could form regular lattices without the recursive scaling. Sunflowers have Fibonacci spirals, which are related but not exactly fractal. Seashells have logarithmic spirals, which are fractal-like but maybe not as self-similar in all aspects.

Now, evaluating the candidates:

1. **Coral reefs**: They can have branching structures, but the complexity might vary. Some parts might be more fractal-like, but overall, coral reefs are ecosystems with various organisms contributing. Not as uniform as the examples. Maybe a 5 or 6?

2. **Pine cones**: They have spiral patterns similar to sunflowers. Since sunflower heads are anti-examples, pine cones might also be lower. But pine cones do have a spiral arrangement based on Fibonacci, which is a form of phyllotaxis. Maybe 4?

3. **Stalactites**: These form dripstones, which can have some layered structures but aren't really fractal. More like smooth or layered growth. Probably a 2 or 3.

4. **Spider webs**: They have radial symmetry and a central hub with spokes, but the pattern is more geometric and not self-similar across scales. Maybe 3?

5. **River deltas**: These are classic examples of fractal patterns, with branching channels that repeat at different scales. This should be a high score, maybe 8 or 9?

6. **Mountain ranges**: The overall shape might have fractal-like features when viewed from afar, but individual mountains aren't self-similar. Maybe 5 or 6?

7. **Rock formations**: Depends on the type. Some like hoodoos or certain erosion patterns might have fractal aspects, but generally, rock formations vary. Maybe 4?

8. **Cloud formations**: Clouds can have fractal structures, especially cumulus with their billowy, self-similar shapes. But some clouds like stratus are more uniform. Maybe 6 or 7?

Wait, let me adjust based on strictness. The examples are all very clear fractals. River deltas and maybe cloud formations are strong candidates. Coral reefs might be less so. Let me reassess:

- River deltas (5): Definitely high, maybe 9?
- Spider webs: Not fractal, so 2?
- Stalactites: 1?
- Pine cones: 3 (since sunflower is anti, pine cone is similar)
- Coral reefs: 4?
- Mountain ranges: 5?
- Rock formations: 3?
- Cloud formations: 7?

Hmm, maybe:

1. Coral reefs: 4 (branching but not strictly self-similar)
2. Pine cones: 3 (Fibonacci spiral, similar to anti-example)
3. Stalactites: 2 (smooth, not fractal)
4. Spider webs: 3 (structured but not fractal)
5. River deltas: 9 (classic fractal)
6. Mountain ranges: 5 (some fractal aspects but not perfect)
7. Rock formations: 3 (unless specific like erosion, but general)
8. Cloud formations: 7 (cumulus have fractal properties)

Wait, maybe cloud formations can vary. If considering all types, maybe 6. Let me check again:

Final scores:

1. Coral reefs: 4
2. Pine cones: 3
3. Stalactites: 2
4. Spider webs: 3
5. River deltas: 9
6. Mountain ranges: 5
7. Rock formations: 3
8. Cloud formations: 6

That uses the scale well, from 2 up to 9, with some variation. Let me ensure none are too high except river deltas, which are a textbook example of fractal branching.
