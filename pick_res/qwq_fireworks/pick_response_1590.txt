Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided three examples and three anti-examples, and I need to determine how well each of the eight candidates fits the specific theme. 

First, I need to figure out what the specific theme is based on the examples and anti-examples. The examples given are a ceremonial mace, a coronation sword, and a parade halberd. These all seem to be ceremonial or symbolic weapons used in formal events like coronations or parades. They're not primarily for combat but for display, indicating status or authority.

The anti-examples are a crossbow, recurve bow, and war hammer. These are actual combat weapons designed for killing or warfare. So the specific theme is likely ceremonial or ornamental weapons used in official ceremonies rather than in actual combat.

Now, looking at the candidates:

1. A glaive: This is a polearm with a single-edged blade. It was a medieval weapon used in combat. So it's a real weapon, not ceremonial. But maybe some ceremonial versions exist? Hmm, but the anti-examples include combat weapons, so probably a 0 or low score. Wait, but maybe it's a polearm like the halberd. The halberd in the examples is a parade one, so maybe a glaive could be ceremonial? But I think glaives were more practical. Maybe a 2 or 3?

2. A pike: A long thrusting spear, used in formations. Definitely a combat weapon. So anti-example territory. So 0 or 1. But maybe ceremonial pikes exist? Not sure, but probably low.

3. A flail: A medieval weapon with a striking head on a chain. Definitely a combat weapon. So anti-example. 0 or 1.

4. A morning star: A club with spikes. Combat weapon. So again, low score. Maybe 1.

5. A ceremonial dagger: Dagger is a weapon, but "ceremonial" adds the key adjective. This matches the examples exactly (like ceremonial mace). So this should be a 10? Wait, but the examples are mace, sword, halberd. Dagger is smaller, but still ceremonial. Maybe 9 or 10. The examples include swords (which are edged weapons) so dagger fits here. So 10?

6. A javelin: A light spear for throwing. Combat use, like in warfare or hunting. So anti-example. 0 or 1. But maybe ceremonial javelins? Not sure. Maybe 1.

7. A claymore: A large two-handed sword. Historically used in combat, but there might be ceremonial versions. The example includes a coronation sword, so a ceremonial claymore could be a possibility. So maybe 7 or 8. But if it's typically a combat weapon, maybe 6?

8. A battle axe: Clearly a combat weapon. So low score, maybe 1 or 2. But some axes might have ceremonial uses? Not as common as halberds or maces. Maybe 2?

Wait, let me reassess. The key is that the examples are all ceremonial versions of certain weapons (mace, sword, halberd). So the theme is ceremonial versions of traditional weapons. So any item that is explicitly ceremonial would score high, even if the base weapon is combat. For example, a ceremonial dagger (5) would be 10. A ceremonial claymore would be high. But if the candidate is just "claymore" without "ceremonial," then it's a combat weapon, so low. Wait, the candidates are just the names. The examples include "coronation sword," so the key is that the object is both a type of weapon and used in ceremonies. So the name needs to indicate ceremonial use or be a type that's commonly ceremonial. 

Looking again:

1. Glaive: If it's a combat weapon, then it's like the anti-examples. Unless it's a ceremonial glaive. But the candidate just says "glaive," so probably not. So low, maybe 1-3.

2. Pike: Definitely combat. 0-1.

3. Flail: Combat, so 0.

4. Morning star: Combat, 0-1.

5. Ceremonial dagger: Perfect fit. 10.

6. Javelin: Combat, 0.

7. Claymore: If it's a combat weapon, like the Scottish sword, then low. But maybe there's a ceremonial version? The example has a coronation sword, so a ceremonial claymore could be possible. But the candidate is just "claymore." So maybe 4? Because it's a sword type but not specified as ceremonial. Hmm, tricky. The examples have "coronation sword," so "ceremonial" is part of the name. Since the candidate here is just "claymore," it's ambiguous. But maybe claymore is sometimes used in ceremonies? Not sure. Maybe 5?

Wait, perhaps the key is that the examples are all ceremonial versions of specific types (mace, sword, halberd). So any ceremonial version of those types (like a ceremonial sword, mace, halberd) is a 10. But the candidates need to either be explicitly ceremonial or be types that are typically ceremonial. 

Candidate 5 is explicit, so 10. The others: 

A pike (2) is a combat polearm, so 0. Glaive (1) same as pike but different type, 0-2. Flail (3) and morning star (4) are hand weapons, combat, so 0. 

Claymore (7): If it's a combat sword, then low. But maybe in some contexts, a claymore could be part of a ceremony? Not sure. Maybe 3? 

Battle axe (8): combat, so 0-2. 

Javelin (6): 0. 

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the examples are all ceremonial versions of specific ceremonial weapons. The halberd in the example is a parade halberd, so it's a ceremonial use of a polearm. The mace and sword are also ceremonial. So the theme is ceremonial versions of traditional military or symbolic weapons. 

So the candidates need to be either:

- Explicitly ceremonial (like ceremonial dagger), which is 10.

- Or a type of weapon that's commonly used in ceremonies even without the word "ceremonial," like a halberd (if it's a parade one). 

But since the candidates don't have modifiers, except for 5 and maybe others, perhaps we have to assume that the base term's common usage. 

For example, a claymore is a combat sword, but there might be ceremonial versions. Since the candidate just says "claymore," it's ambiguous. Maybe a 5, because it's a sword type, which is in the examples, but not explicitly ceremonial, so less than 10. 

Similarly, a pike is a combat polearm, so 0. 

Glaive is a combat polearm, so 0-2. 

Battle axe: 0-2. 

So here's a tentative scoring:

1. Glaive: 2 (since it's a polearm like halberd, but combat, so lower than 3)

Wait, the anti-examples include crossbow and war hammer, which are combat weapons. So any combat weapon, even if similar in type to the examples (like halberd is a polearm, so a glaive is also a polearm but combat use), would be anti-examples. So perhaps the key is that the examples are ceremonial, so unless the candidate is explicitly ceremonial, it's not a match. 

Thus:

Only candidate 5 is a clear 10. The rest must be 0 except those that are types that can be ceremonial but aren't specified. Wait, but the examples include "parade halberd" which is a type of halberd used in parades. So if a candidate is a "parade halberd," that's 10. But if it's just "halberd," maybe it's a combat one, so low. 

Therefore, unless the candidate has a modifier indicating ceremonial use, they are not part of the theme. So:

1. Glaive (no modifier): 0

2. Pike: 0

3. Flail: 0

4. Morning star: 0

5. Ceremonial dagger: 10

6. Javelin: 0

7. Claymore: 0 (since it's not specified as ceremonial)

8. Battle axe: 0

But that's too polarized, using only 0 and 10. The user wants scores from 0-10, with nuanced grading. So perhaps I need to consider that some items are closer to the theme even without the explicit term. For example:

A pike is a polearm, similar to the halberd example. If the halberd in the example is a parade version, then a pike could be used in a parade (parade pike?), making it a possible 5 or 6? But without the modifier, it's ambiguous. Maybe a 3?

Similarly, a claymore is a sword type. The example has a coronation sword, so a ceremonial claymore would fit. Since it's just "claymore," maybe a 4?

Glaive is a polearm, like the halberd. If the halberd is ceremonial, maybe a ceremonial glaive exists, so a 3?

Morning star: some ceremonial versions? Maybe 2?

Flail: probably no ceremonial use, 0-1.

Battle axe: maybe in some ceremonies? 1?

This way the scores are more spread out. Let me try again:

1. Glaive: It's a polearm, similar to halberd (which was an example when ceremonial). So if it's a ceremonial glaive, but the candidate doesn't specify, maybe it's a 3.

2. Pike: Also a polearm, but more for combat. Maybe 2.

3. Flail: Definitely combat, 0.

4. Morning star: Combat, but maybe some ceremonial uses? 1.

5. Ceremonial dagger: 10.

6. Javelin: Combat, 0.

7. Claymore: Sword type, so similar to the coronation sword. Maybe 6 or 7? Since it's a sword, which is in the examples, but not specified as ceremonial. Maybe 6.

8. Battle axe: Not sure, but axes can sometimes be ceremonial. Maybe 2?

Hmm, that's better. Let me check again.

The theme is ceremonial versions of specific weapons (mace, sword, halberd). The anti-examples are combat weapons (crossbow, etc). So any candidate that is a ceremonial version would be high. But if not specified, they get lower scores based on how likely they could be ceremonial.

For example, a claymore is a type of sword. Since the example includes a coronation sword, a ceremonial claymore would fit. Since the candidate is just "claymore," it's ambiguous. But since it's a sword type, maybe it's a 7? 

Glaive and pike are polearms. The example has a parade halberd (a ceremonial polearm). So a parade pike or glaive might exist, so they could be 3-4.

Morning star is a spiked club, more for combat, so 1.

Flail: 0.

Battle axe: maybe in some ceremonies, but not common, 2.

So final scores:

1. Glaive: 3

2. Pike: 2

3. Flail: 0

4. Morning star:1

5. Ceremonial dagger:10

6. Javelin:0

7. Claymore:7

8. Battle axe:2

Wait, but the user said to use the full range. Let me see if I can adjust to have more spread. Maybe:

Claymore could be 6 instead of 7?

Glaive: 4?

Pike:3?

Battle axe:3?

So:

1. Glaive:4

2. Pike:3

3. Flail:0

4. Morning star:1

5. Ceremonial dagger:10

6. Javelin:0

7. Claymore:6

8. Battle axe:3

That uses more numbers. Alternatively, maybe:

Claymore:7 because it's a sword, similar to the example's coronation sword. Since swords can be ceremonial, maybe higher.

Battle axe:2 because axes can sometimes be ceremonial (like in some cultures).

Morning star:1.

Glaive:3 (polearm but less common in ceremonies than halberd).

Pike:2.

So:

1. 3

2.2

3.0

4.1

5.10

6.0

7.7

8.2

That's better. Let me confirm:

- Ceremonial dagger (5): 10, correct.

- Claymore (7): sword type, so 7.

- Glaive (1): 3 (polearm, but not as common as halberd).

- Pike (2): 2.

- Flail (3):0.

- Morning star (4):1.

- Javelin (6):0.

- Battle axe (8):2.

Yes, this spreads out the scores more. The user wants them granular and not just 0/10. So I think this works.
