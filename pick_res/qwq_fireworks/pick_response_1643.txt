Okay, let's tackle this. First, I need to figure out the specific theme from the examples given. The examples are Native American beadwork patterns with symmetry groups, Inca quipu knots for numerical data, and Celtic knots showing infinity and interconnectedness. 

So the common thread here seems to be cultural artifacts that use patterns or designs to represent mathematical or conceptual ideas. Specifically, they are using visual or structural elements to encode information like symmetry, numerical data, or abstract concepts (infinity). The key is that these are visual/mathematical concepts embedded in traditional crafts or recording systems.

Now, the anti-examples are African fractal architecture, Islamic geometric patterns, and Polynesian navigation charts. These are related but broader. The anti-examples might involve math in design but perhaps not as directly tied to recording data or specific mathematical concepts like symmetry groups or numerical systems. For instance, Islamic patterns are about geometry but maybe not specifically for recording info like the quipu. Fractal architecture is a different kind of math application, and navigation charts use math for mapping, which is a different purpose.

So the specific theme is: cultural artifacts that use visual patterns or structures to encode specific mathematical concepts or data (like symmetry groups, numerical data, abstract concepts of infinity). 

Now evaluating each candidate:

1. Mesopotamian clay tablets: These were used for writing and record-keeping, including mathematical texts. But the examples are about patterns in crafts or knots. Clay tablets are more about written symbols than visual patterns encoding math. So maybe lower score, like 3?

2. African sand drawings from Angola demonstrating graph theory: The examples include graph theory principles. The anti-examples include African fractals, which are broader. Since graph theory is a specific math concept, this might be a good fit. But the anti-example is African fractal architecture, so maybe this is close but not exactly the same? Maybe 7?

3. Mayan calendar calculations: The Mayan calendar involves complex calculations and numerical systems. The Inca quipu is about numerical data. So this is similar in that it's numerical, but is it a visual pattern? The calendar is more about the system itself rather than a visual design encoding it. Maybe 5 or 6?

4. Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic numerals: Numerals are symbols for numbers, but again, not a visual pattern like beadwork or knots. So maybe 2?

5. Babylonian base-60 number system: The system itself is a mathematical concept, but again, the representation (like cuneiform) is symbols, not a pattern. So maybe similar to 4, score 2?

6. Chinese magic squares: Magic squares are a mathematical concept (numbers arranged so rows/columns sum to same). They are visual patterns with mathematical properties. This seems to fit the theme well. So maybe 8 or 9?

7. Aztec codex calculations: Codices have pictorial records and calculations. The quipu is a recording system. This is similar but the codex uses pictures and text, not a structured pattern like knots or beadwork. Maybe 5?

8. Chinese counting rods: These are physical rods used to represent numbers in calculations. They have a positional system. It's a tool for calculation, so maybe like the quipu's knots. So perhaps 6?

Wait, need to check again. The specific theme is about patterns in the artifact itself that demonstrate the mathematical concept. 

For example, beadwork's symmetry groups are part of the design. Quipu's knots are the data. Celtic knots show infinity through their design. 

So magic squares (6) are a grid pattern with numbers arranged to meet a condition, so that's a visual pattern encoding math. That's a strong fit (maybe 9). 

Chinese counting rods are physical tools arranged, so their arrangement is part of the calculation, but maybe not a fixed pattern in the artifact itself. So maybe 5?

Mayan calendar calculations (3) are about the system's math but not the visual pattern. So 3?

Mesopotamian clay tablets (1) are just the medium, not the pattern. 1?

Egyptian numerals (4) are symbols, so 1?

Babylonian base-60 (5) same as 4, so 2?

Aztec codex (7) uses pictures, not structured patterns like knots or beadwork. Maybe 3?

Chinese counting rods (8) are tools, so 4?

Hmm, let me re-assign:

1. Mesopotamian clay tablets: These are records, but the tablets themselves aren't patterns. 1.

2. African sand drawings with graph theory: The sand drawings are patterns demonstrating a math concept. This is similar to the examples. So maybe 8?

Wait, but the anti-example includes African fractal architecture, which is broader. The sand drawings here are specifically about graph theory, which is a specific concept like the examples. So maybe 8.

3. Mayan calendar: The calendar's math is abstract, but the codices might show it through symbols, not patterns. 3.

4. Egyptian numerals: Symbols, so 1.

5. Babylonian base-60: The system is math, but the representation is cuneiform symbols. 2.

6. Chinese magic squares: Perfect fit. 9.

7. Aztec codex calculations: Uses pictorial records, not structured patterns. 3?

8. Chinese counting rods: The rods are tools arranged in a way that represents numbers, but the rods themselves aren't a fixed pattern. Maybe 5?

Wait, counting rods are arranged to perform calculations, so their arrangement is part of the system. Maybe that's similar to quipu's knots encoding numbers. So perhaps 6?

Hmm, maybe:

1. 1

2. 8

3. 4 (since Mayan calendar is numerical like quipu but less about the visual pattern)

4. 1

5. 2

6. 9

7. 3

8. 6

Alternatively, maybe Aztec codex uses glyphs and calculations, but not as a pattern. So 3.

Let me finalize:

1. 1 (clay tablets are records but not patterns)

2. 8 (graph theory in sand drawings matches the concept)

3. 4 (Mayan calendar is numerical but not a visual pattern like quipu)

4. 1 (hieroglyphic numerals are symbols)

5. 2 (base-60 is a system, not a visual pattern)

6. 9 (magic squares are perfect)

7. 3 (codex calculations use pictures, not structured patterns)

8. 5 (counting rods are tools arranged, so somewhat similar to quipu but less integrated into the artifact itself)
