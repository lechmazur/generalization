Okay, let me try to figure out the specific theme here based on the examples and anti-examples provided. 

First, looking at the examples:
1. A wedding with recycled metal rings exchanged in silence.
2. A house blessing using only salt and natural light.
3. A coming-of-age celebration with water and a single candle.

These all seem to have a few common elements. They focus on simplicity, using minimal or specific natural/recycled materials. The rituals are understated, maybe even solemn, with limited elements. There's an emphasis on the symbolic use of materials (like salt, water, metal) and perhaps a minimalist approach in the setting or the number of items used. Also, some involve silence or a quiet atmosphere, which might indicate a focus on introspection or simplicity in presentation.

Now the anti-examples are:
1. Catholic mass with full choir and incense – this is more elaborate, uses more elements (choir, incense), so the original theme isn't about grandeur or complex rituals.
2. Elaborate Hindu wedding – again, elaborate, so the original theme prefers simplicity.
3. Tibetan sand mandala – though it uses natural materials, it's a complex, intricate process, so maybe the original theme requires even more minimalism or a specific focus on a single element or two, rather than intricate patterns.

So the specific theme seems to be rituals or ceremonies that use very few, specific natural or recycled materials, are simple in their setup, and possibly emphasize symbolic acts over grandeur. They might also involve silence or a subdued atmosphere, and focus on a single key element (like a ring, salt, water, candle) rather than multiple elements.

Now evaluating the candidates:

1. A bar mitzvah celebration – Bar mitzvahs can vary, but traditional ones might involve readings, prayers, maybe music. They might not be overly elaborate, but they are usually more involved than the examples given. They might not use minimal materials or focus on a single symbolic item. So maybe a lower score, maybe 3 or 4?

2. A Chinese New Year parade – These are usually very colorful, with lots of decorations, dragons, fireworks, etc. Definitely not minimalistic. So probably a 0 or 1. But maybe some aspects? Not really, so 0.

3. An Olympic opening ceremony – These are huge, elaborate events with lots of elements, performances, technology. Definitely not minimal. 0.

4. A military funeral – These are solemn, but they do have specific elements like the flag folding, 21-gun salute, etc. They might use some symbolic items (flag, rifle volleys), but the ceremony is more about tradition and formality. Maybe a 2 or 3? Since it's solemn but not necessarily using minimal materials or the exact elements from examples. Maybe a 3.

5. A traditional African naming ceremony – These often involve family, maybe some rituals with water, maybe some symbolic items. But they can vary widely. If it uses a few key elements (like water, maybe a specific item) and is simple, maybe a 5? But not sure if it's as minimal as the examples. Maybe 4 or 5.

6. A baptism ceremony – Baptism typically uses water, which is one of the elements in the examples (like the coming-of-age with water). However, baptisms might have more elements like a minister, congregation, maybe a cross or other symbols. If it's just water and maybe a candle, but if it's more elaborate, then maybe a 4. But since water is a key element, perhaps a 5 or 6?

Wait, the example had water and a single candle. So if the baptism uses only water, maybe it's closer. But traditional baptisms might have more. Hmm, tricky. Maybe a 5.

7. A tea ceremony performed in an empty white room with just one ceramic cup – This seems very minimalist, using a single cup, a simple setting. The examples used minimal items (salt, candle, rings). This matches the simplicity and focus on a single key element (tea and a cup). So maybe a 9 or 10. But the examples also had specific materials (recycled metal, natural light, etc.), so maybe the tea ceremony with just one cup in an empty room is a very close match. So maybe 9?

8. A Zen garden dedication – Zen gardens are minimalist, using sand and rocks. The act might be simple. This uses natural elements (sand, rocks) and is minimalistic. The examples used salt and natural light, so similar. So maybe a 8 or 9. But maybe a bit more elements than the examples? The examples had one or two elements, like salt and natural light. Zen garden has two elements (sand and rocks), but maybe that's okay. So maybe 8?

Wait, the examples had a wedding with rings (metal) and silence; house blessing with salt and natural light (two elements), coming of age with water and candle (two elements). So the Zen garden with two elements (sand and rocks) might fit. So maybe 8 or 9. The tea ceremony is even more minimal (one cup?), but maybe the cup is the only element besides the tea? Not sure. Let me think again.

The first example had two elements: recycled metal rings (so two rings, but made of the same material) and the act of exchanging in silence. The second had salt and natural light. Third had water and candle. So each example uses two elements, plus a specific action. The Zen garden uses two elements (sand and rocks) and is a dedication, so maybe 8. The tea ceremony has one main element (tea) and a cup, so maybe two elements. The room is empty except for the cup, so that's minimal. Maybe 9. 

So let's go through each again:

1. Bar mitzvah – not minimal, has multiple elements. Maybe 2 or 3.

2. Chinese New Year parade – 0.

3. Olympic opening – 0.

4. Military funeral – maybe 3? It's solemn but not focused on minimal materials. The flag, perhaps, but not sure. Maybe 2.

5. African naming – maybe 4. If it uses a few items but not overly, but not as strict as the examples.

6. Baptism – if it's just water and maybe a candle, but traditionally might have more. Maybe 5.

7. Tea ceremony – 9.

8. Zen garden – 8.

Wait, the first example's "recycled metal rings" are a specific material, so maybe the tea ceremony uses ceramic cup (natural material?), which is okay. The Zen garden uses sand and stones, natural materials. So they fit. The tea ceremony is very minimal, so 9. The Zen garden is 8.

So the scores would be:

1. 3

2. 0

3. 0

4. 2

5. 4

6. 5

7. 9

8. 8

Wait, let me check again for military funeral: maybe the flag folding is a symbolic act, but it's not using just one or two materials. The flag is one, but the ceremony includes the folding, maybe a rifle team, etc. So maybe 1 or 2. Let me adjust military funeral to 2.

Traditional African naming: maybe some rituals with water or oil, maybe a name-giving with a few items. If it's simple, maybe 4.

Baptism: water is key, but maybe a candle is part of it in some traditions. So if it's just water and a candle, then 7? But I'm not sure. The coming-of-age had water and candle. So baptism with water and maybe a candle would be similar. So maybe 7? Hmm, but the examples had two elements. So maybe baptism with water and a candle would be a 7 or 8. Wait, but if it's only water and a candle, then same as the example, so 10? Wait, but the examples had other elements. Wait the coming-of-age was water and candle, so maybe a baptism with those elements would be a perfect match. But if the baptism includes more elements like a cross, priest, etc., then it's less. Since the question says "ceremony" but the examples are specific in their elements. The candidate is "a baptism ceremony" without specifics. So maybe it's too general. So perhaps 5 or 6. Since the examples are very specific in their items (only salt and light, etc.), if the baptism uses only water and a candle, then it's a 10. But since the candidate is just "baptism ceremony" without specifying, maybe it's less. Hmm, this is tricky. Let's say 5.

Alternatively, if the baptism uses only water (like in some denominations), then maybe a 6 or 7. Maybe 6.

Alternatively, maybe the anti-examples are more elaborate, so baptism could be moderate. Let me think. Since the examples are very specific in their elements, the candidate has to match that specificity. So unless the baptism uses only water and a candle, it's not a perfect match. Since the candidate is just a baptism, which might include more elements, so maybe a 5.

Alright, going with that.
