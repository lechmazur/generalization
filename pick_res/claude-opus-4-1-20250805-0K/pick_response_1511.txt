Looking at the examples, the specific theme is: **scientific discoveries/achievements that were initially dismissed/reported as a "hoax" by newspapers**.

The key elements are:
1. A genuine scientific discovery or achievement
2. Initial dismissal specifically as a "hoax"
3. By newspapers/media

The anti-examples show broader scientific skepticism or controversy but lack the specific "hoax" dismissal by newspapers.
