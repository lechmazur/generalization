Looking at the examples, the specific theme appears to be: **waiting at a designated physical location for a minimum specified time before using a transportation/transit service**.

The key elements are:
1. Physical waiting at a designated spot
2. Minimum wait time specified
3. Transportation/transit context
4. Fixed location/stop

The anti-examples show alternatives that avoid this waiting pattern through direct/immediate services.
