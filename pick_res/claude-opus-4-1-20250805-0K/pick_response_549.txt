Looking at the examples, the specific theme appears to be: bass guitars with two humbucker pickups and exactly one volume knob and one tone knob (minimalist control layout).

The anti-examples all have two humbucker pickups but with more complex control systems (equalizers, blend controls, multiple bands, etc.).
