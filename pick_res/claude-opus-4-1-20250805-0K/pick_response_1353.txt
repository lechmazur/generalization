Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: adaptations (biological or human-made) specifically for desert/arid environments. The anti-examples show adaptations for other extreme environments (deep ocean, space), which helps distinguish that the theme is specifically about desert adaptations, not just any extreme environment adaptation.

Let me evaluate each candidate:

1. Deep-sea anglerfish - adaptation for deep ocean (like anti-examples), not desert
2. High-altitude mountaineering tent - adaptation for mountains/cold, not desert
3. Polar bear - adaptation for cold/arctic, not desert
4. Mangrove tree - adaptation for coastal/brackish water, not desert
5. Rainforest orchid - adaptation for humid/wet conditions (opposite of desert)
6. Snowshoe hare - adaptation for snowy/cold environments, not desert
7. Skyscraper - urban engineering, not desert-specific adaptation
8. Barrel cactus - classic desert adaptation with water storage for arid conditions
