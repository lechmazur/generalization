Looking at the examples (Vienna Secession, Fluxus, Dadaism) and anti-examples (Performance Art, Street Art, Surrealism), I can identify the specific theme as organized art movements that explicitly opposed or broke away from traditional art institutions and practices.

The examples all represent organized movements with manifestos or clear ideological positions that actively rebelled against established art conventions. The anti-examples either represent mediums/practices rather than movements (Performance Art, Street Art) or movements that were avant-garde but not fundamentally anti-institutional (Surrealism).
