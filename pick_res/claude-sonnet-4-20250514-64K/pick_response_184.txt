Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes the specific theme from the broader related themes.

The examples (Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Trans-Siberian Railway) appear to be major achievements from the late 19th century (1880s-1890s) that became cultural icons and symbols of human progress, capturing public imagination beyond their purely functional purpose.

The anti-examples (Suez Canal, Panama Canal, Canadian Pacific Railway) represent major infrastructure projects that, while significant achievements, remained more focused on practical/commercial purposes rather than becoming celebrated symbols of cultural achievement.
