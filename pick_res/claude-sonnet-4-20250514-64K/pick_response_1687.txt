Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what makes Lion, Wolf, and Tiger different from Cougar and Grizzly, while noting that Rocky Mountains contains no animal name at all.

The examples (Lion, Wolf, Tiger) appear to represent globally iconic, culturally significant apex predators that feature prominently in worldwide literature, mythology, and symbolism. The anti-examples show that while animal names are part of a broader pattern, the specific theme excludes more regionally significant predators like Cougar and Grizzly.
