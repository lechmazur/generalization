Looking at the examples (cell membrane, dialysis machine, kidney), I can identify a specific theme of selective filtration/permeability - systems that allow certain substances to pass through while blocking others based on their properties. The anti-examples (turnstile, ventilation duct, revolving door) represent broader themes of passage control without the selective filtering aspect.
