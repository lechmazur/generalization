Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: Dakar, Accra, Luanda - all major African capitals that are significant economic centers, regional hubs, and have substantial metropolitan populations.

Anti-examples: Freetown, Conakry, Monrovia - smaller or less economically prominent African capitals, often in countries with recent challenges.

The theme appears to be major, economically important African capital cities that serve as significant regional commercial and economic centers.
