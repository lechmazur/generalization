Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- Hawaiian pidgin: A creole language from cultural contact
- Afrobeat music: A fusion music genre combining distinct traditions  
- Blues music: A genre emerging from cultural mixing

Anti-examples:
- Hip-hop culture: A broader cultural movement (not a specific art form)
- Reggae music: Regional development rather than explicit fusion
- Punk rock: Countercultural movement, not about cultural fusion

The theme appears to be: Specific cultural expressions that emerged from the direct contact and fusion of distinct cultural groups.
