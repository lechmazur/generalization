Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: wooden objects that serve both practical food-related functions AND ceremonial/ritual/symbolic purposes.

The examples show:
- Wooden spoon: stirs food + blessing rituals
- Wooden bowl: serves food + ceremonial offerings  
- Wooden pestle: grinds spices + fertility symbolism

The anti-examples (altar, cross, totem pole) are wooden and ceremonial but lack the food-related functionality that distinguishes the specific theme.
