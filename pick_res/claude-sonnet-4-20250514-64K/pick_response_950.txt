Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify a pattern around androgynous artists with stark, sculptural aesthetics and assertive personas who achieved major breakthrough success in the early 1980s new wave/early MTV era.

The examples (Grace Jones, Annie Lennox, Prince) all share geometric, angular visual presentations and strong, commanding personas, contrasting with the anti-examples who tend toward more decorative aesthetics (Boy George), different eras (Janelle Mon√°e, Marc Bolan), or gentler personas.
