Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as "commonly used standard examples" - the kind of generic, go-to examples that people typically use when they need to provide sample data or illustrations.

The examples (john.doe@email.com, John Smith, a red widget) are all classic, overused examples in their respective categories, while the anti-examples represent broader placeholder/demo concepts but aren't the specific standard examples everyone defaults to.
