Looking at the examples (musical canon, nautilus shell, crystal lattice) versus the anti-examples (snowflake, kaleidoscope pattern, pinecone), I can identify the specific theme as systematic repetition with precise mathematical relationships or laws, rather than just patterns, symmetry, or organic arrangements.

The examples all feature:
- Systematic repetition following strict mathematical or physical rules
- Precise mathematical relationships in their structure
- Either temporal or spatial systematic progression/transformation

The anti-examples have patterns but lack this specific systematic mathematical precision.
