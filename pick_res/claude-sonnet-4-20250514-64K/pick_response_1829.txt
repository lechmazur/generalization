Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what makes the examples distinctive from the broader category.

Examples: Emerald Bay State Park, Silver Falls State Park, Golden Gate Park
Anti-examples: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Grand Canyon National Park, Everglades National Park

The specific theme appears to be parks/protected areas with color or metal names (Emerald=green gemstone, Silver=metal, Golden=color), while the anti-examples are parks without such color/metal naming.
