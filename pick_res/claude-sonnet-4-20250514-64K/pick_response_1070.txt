Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

The examples (hydraulic dam, gas cylinder, pressure cooker) all contain pressure and have integrated control/regulation mechanisms for managing that pressure as part of their primary function.

The anti-examples (scuba tank, fire extinguisher, compressor) either focus on storage/delivery, emergency discharge, or pressure creation without integrated regulation systems.

The specific theme appears to be: pressure containment systems with integrated pressure regulation mechanisms.
