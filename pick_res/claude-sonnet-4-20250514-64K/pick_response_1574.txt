Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- Northern Italy (specifically areas like Aquileia): Inland Roman heritage area, later Germanic influence
- Catalonia (specifically areas around Barcelona): Roman heritage region, later Visigothic/Frankish rule  
- Southern England (specifically areas like the Weald): Inland Roman area, later Anglo-Saxon control

Anti-examples:
- Venice: Major coastal trading city, maritime focus
- Alexandria: Major coastal trading center, continuously important commercially
- Sidon: Ancient coastal trading city, maritime commercial center

The pattern appears to be inland Roman heritage regions (particularly those that later came under Germanic/northern European influence) versus major coastal trading centers.
