Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: Great Auk (extinct 1844), Passenger Pigeon (extinct 1914), Steller's Sea Cow (extinct 1768) - all went extinct in the 18th-early 20th century period due to direct human hunting.

Anti-examples: Golden Toad (extinct 1989), Pyrenean Ibex (extinct 2000), Western Black Rhinoceros (extinct 2011) - all went extinct much more recently in the late 20th/early 21st century.

The specific theme appears to be animals that went extinct during the historical period roughly from mid-18th century to early 20th century (1768-1914) primarily due to direct human hunting/exploitation.
