Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: structures that use both tension and compression elements in an integrated structural system AND exceed 10 meters in at least one key dimension.

The examples show:
- Large circus tent: compression pole + tension canvas, >10m diameter
- Tensegrity structure: integrated tension-compression system, >10m tall  
- Cable-stayed bridge: compression towers + tension cables, >10m span

The anti-examples confirm this: structures with similar principles but <10m, or structures with mainly tension without significant compression integration.
