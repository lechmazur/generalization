Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: religious buildings (churches, mosques, temples) that have been converted to serve different purposes - either different religious functions or secular functions. The anti-examples show secular buildings (palaces) converted to museums, representing a broader theme of functional conversion but specifically excluding the religious origin criterion.
