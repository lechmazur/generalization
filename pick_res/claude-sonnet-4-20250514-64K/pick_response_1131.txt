Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples (Lego building sets, 3D printer filament systems, Modular synthesizer components) are all modular/interchangeable systems used for creation, building, or making something new.

Anti-examples (Modular shelving, power tools, furniture) are modular systems but focused on utility, organization, or work rather than creation.

The specific theme appears to be: modular/interchangeable systems primarily used for creative expression, building, or making new things.
