Looking at the examples, I can identify a pattern of natural processes where water moves from one type of natural water system/reservoir to a different type of natural location:

- Rivers to surrounding land areas (flooding)
- Glacial ice to rivers and lakes (melting) 
- Precipitation to aquifers (infiltration)

The anti-examples show this excludes artificial water management systems and water movement within the same system (like ocean currents).
