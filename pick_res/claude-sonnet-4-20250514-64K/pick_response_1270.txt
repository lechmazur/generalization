Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the theme:

Examples (Pulsars, Helium, Neptune) are discrete astronomical objects or substances that can be directly observed or detected through electromagnetic radiation.

Anti-examples (Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Gravitational Waves) are diffuse cosmic phenomena that don't interact electromagnetically and require indirect detection methods.
