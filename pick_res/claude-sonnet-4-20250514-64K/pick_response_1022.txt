Looking at the examples, I need to identify the specific theme:

- Discovery of penicillin
- Invention of the printing press  
- Development of the internet

These are all specific innovations that revolutionized fundamental human needs (health, knowledge sharing, communication) and became widely integrated into daily life with primarily positive transformative effects.

The anti-examples represent broader themes but don't match this specific pattern - they're either more specialized initially (Wright flight), have mixed implications (atomic bomb), or are more theoretical/research-oriented (DNA discovery).
