Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: Borobudur, Ziggurat of Ur, Temple of Kukulcan - all are stepped pyramid/ziggurat structures built for religious purposes
Anti-examples: Pyramids of Giza (smooth-sided pyramids), Angkor Wat (horizontal temple complex), Temple Mount (flat platform) - religious structures but not stepped pyramids

The specific theme appears to be: stepped pyramid/ziggurat structures built for religious purposes.
