Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes the specific theme from the broader related themes.

Examples:
- A hydrogen maser
- A superconducting magnet  
- A cloud chamber

Anti-examples:
- A bubble chamber
- A spark chamber
- A particle accelerator

The examples appear to be devices that achieve extraordinary performance through fundamental physical principles and natural phenomena, while the anti-examples represent more engineered or complex approaches to similar functions.
