Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- Celtic Cross at Killamery: Stone carved religious monument
- Mayan Long Count calendar disk: Stone carved calendar artifact  
- Aztec Sun Stone calendar: Stone carved calendar/astronomical artifact

Anti-examples:
- Indian mandala painting: Painted (not carved stone)
- Tibetan prayer wheel: Metal cylindrical object (not carved stone)
- Incan gold disc: Gold material (not stone)

The specific theme appears to be: carved stone objects with religious, astronomical, or calendar significance.
