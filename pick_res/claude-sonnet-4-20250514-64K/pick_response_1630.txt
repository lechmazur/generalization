Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme.

Examples (positive):
- The sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system - Babylonian/Mesopotamian origin
- The cuneiform script - Mesopotamian/Babylonian origin  
- The lunar calendar system - Likely referring to Babylonian lunar calendar system

Anti-examples (negative):
- The Gregorian calendar - European/Christian origin
- The Julian calendar - Roman origin
- The Egyptian calendar - Egyptian origin

The pattern shows these are all Babylonian/Mesopotamian cultural innovations. The anti-examples are purposefully misleading because they are also calendar systems (like one positive example) but from different cultures.
