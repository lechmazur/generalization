Looking at the examples, I need to identify the specific theme:
- beehive: sophisticated biological construction with organized internal structure
- space station: sophisticated human construction with complex modular systems  
- suspension bridge: sophisticated engineered structure with systematic cable design

These represent sophisticated constructed/engineered structures with complex internal organization.

The anti-examples (river, glacier, tree) are natural formations without sophisticated construction or engineering.

Now evaluating the candidates based on their degree of structural sophistication and organized complexity:
