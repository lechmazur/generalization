Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: bean bag chair, hammock, recliner
Anti-examples: sleeping pad, sleeping bag, cot

The examples are all comfortable furniture designed for lounging and relaxation with special positioning features, while the anti-examples are basic, utilitarian sleeping gear that's portable and minimal.
