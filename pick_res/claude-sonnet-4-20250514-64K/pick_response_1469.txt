Looking at the three examples, I can identify the specific theme: animals using chemical secretions/scents to mark territories or boundaries.

The examples show:
- Musk deer using secretions for territorial marking
- Wolves using scent glands for territorial marking  
- Ants using pheromones for boundary marking

The anti-examples (bird songs, stone walls, peacock displays) represent non-chemical forms of marking - auditory, physical, and visual respectively.
