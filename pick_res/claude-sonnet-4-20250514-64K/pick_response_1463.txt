Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: objects that are specifically attributed intrinsic magical or supernatural powers, often with elements of rarity, prestige, or legendary status.

The examples show:
- A saint's relic said to grant miracles (specific magical power + religious prestige)
- A grimoire owned by a royal sorcerer (contains magical knowledge + royal prestige) 
- A unicorn horn believed to purify water (specific magical power + mythical rarity)

The anti-examples represent broader categories that don't match this specific theme:
- Religious relics without specified powers
- Tools for magical practices rather than objects with inherent powers
