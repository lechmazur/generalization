Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific pattern:

Examples: Merlin's Cave, Gollum's Arch, King Kong's Rock
Anti-examples: Mount Doom, Excalibur Peak, Thor's Hammer

The examples all follow the pattern of [Character's] + [Discrete rock formation] - specifically geological features like caves, arches, and rocks that are bounded, human-scale formations. The anti-examples include broader landscape features (mountains/peaks) or non-geological items (hammer), which helps distinguish the specific theme from broader related themes.
