Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

The examples (pointillist painting, halftone printing image, 3D stereogram) all use small discrete elements or dots to create optical effects, illusions, or visual phenomena that differ from what the individual elements would suggest. The anti-examples use dots or discrete elements for direct representation rather than creating special optical effects.
