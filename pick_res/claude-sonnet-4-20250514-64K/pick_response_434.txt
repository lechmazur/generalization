Looking at the examples, I need to identify the specific theme:
- telescopic fishing rod
- extendable selfie stick  
- adjustable curtain rod

These are all rod-like objects that extend/retract using telescopic sliding mechanisms.

The anti-examples use different mechanisms:
- retractable dog leash (winding mechanism)
- folding ladder (hinged folding)
- retractable clothesline (winding mechanism)
