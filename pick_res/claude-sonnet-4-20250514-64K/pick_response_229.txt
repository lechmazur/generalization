Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as plant-based flexible materials used for writing/recording.

Examples are all plant-derived (mulberry paper, bark paper, papyrus reeds), flexible, and used for inscription.

Anti-examples are writing materials but either non-plant-based (stone, clay) or animal-based (parchment), distinguishing them from the specific theme.
