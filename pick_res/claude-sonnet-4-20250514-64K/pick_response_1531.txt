Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: natural geographic/geological features used as spatial metaphors for hierarchical levels, depth of access, or visibility states in software interfaces.

The examples show:
- Mountain peak = highest level/achievement (vertical hierarchy)
- Canyon = deep dive into detailed settings (access depth)
- Cave = hidden/advanced features (visibility/accessibility)

The anti-examples use natural features for temporal patterns, process flows, or absence - not for spatial interface structure.
