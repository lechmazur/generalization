Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific pattern that distinguishes them.

The examples follow a pattern of [simple calm state adjective] + [fundamental intense force/phenomenon noun], creating strong semantic contradictions with basic vocabulary.

The anti-examples show what doesn't work: wrong directional pattern, non-fundamental nouns, or more complex/process-oriented adjectives.
