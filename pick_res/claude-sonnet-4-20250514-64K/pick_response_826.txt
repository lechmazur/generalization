Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as artificially created patterns using sophisticated techniques or technology, as opposed to natural patterns or simple optical effects.

The examples (fractal image, guilloch√© engraving, trompe-l'oeil tapestry) all involve human/technological creation with advanced methods, while the anti-examples include natural patterns (peacock feather, snowflake) and simple optical devices (kaleidoscope).
