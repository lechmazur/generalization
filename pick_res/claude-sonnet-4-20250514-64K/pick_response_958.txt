Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: mechanical parts/tools/devices named after musical instruments due to physical resemblance or similarity in appearance.

The examples show:
- A valve named after a stringed instrument
- A fuel regulation device resembling a wind instrument  
- A suspension component named after a percussion instrument

The anti-examples help clarify that this theme is specifically about musical instruments, not just any metaphorical naming of parts.
