Looking at the examples, I can identify that they are all eclipsing binary star systems:
- W Ursae Majoris: contact binary eclipsing system
- CM Draconis: eclipsing binary with two red dwarf stars  
- Algol: prototype eclipsing binary system

The anti-examples help clarify this is specifically about eclipsing binaries, not just variable stars, binaries without eclipses, or non-stellar eclipsing phenomena.
