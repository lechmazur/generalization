Looking at the examples, I can identify that the specific theme is about musical styles/genres that contain "Vallenato" in their name, as all three examples (Paseo Vallenato, Son Vallenato, Vallenato) follow this pattern. The anti-examples are Colombian music genres that don't contain "Vallenato" in their names, indicating the broader theme is Colombian music genres.
