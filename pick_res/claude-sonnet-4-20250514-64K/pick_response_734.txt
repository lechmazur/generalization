Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- Mayan pyramids used for religious ceremonies
- Stupas in Buddhist traditions  
- Totem poles in Indigenous cultures

Anti-examples:
- Chinese pagodas
- Greek temples
- Egyptian obelisks

The pattern appears to be religious/ceremonial structures from indigenous, traditional, or culturally-specific practices, as opposed to structures from major ancient civilizations or mainstream architectural traditions.
