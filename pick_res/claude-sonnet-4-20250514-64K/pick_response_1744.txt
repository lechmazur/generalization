Looking at the examples (magic lantern, stereoscope, magnifying glass) versus the anti-examples (telescope, loupe, binoculars), I can identify the specific theme as simple, traditional optical devices versus complex, specialized optical instruments.

The examples share characteristics of being optically simple, traditionally used for entertainment/everyday purposes, while the anti-examples represent more complex, specialized, or professional optical instruments.
