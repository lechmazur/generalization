Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme around devices that measure skin conductance/electrical properties to assess emotional states (stress, relaxation, arousal) and display the results on integrated screens.

The anti-examples help clarify what this theme is NOT - they measure other physiological parameters (heart rate, blood pressure) for general health monitoring rather than skin conductance for emotional assessment.
