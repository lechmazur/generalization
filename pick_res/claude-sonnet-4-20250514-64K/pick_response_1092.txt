Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme about traditional/indigenous cultural elements that both continue in their traditional forms AND have evolved or adapted into modern applications, showing cultural continuity alongside modern evolution.

The anti-examples follow a different pattern - they're about traditional/ancient elements being used in modern contexts, but without the emphasis on both ongoing traditional practice and modern evolution.
