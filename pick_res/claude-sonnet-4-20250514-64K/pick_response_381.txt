Looking at the examples (siphon, vacuum pump, centrifugal pump) versus the anti-examples (water pump, hydroelectric dam, diaphragm pump), I can identify the specific theme as devices that use dynamic pressure principles or kinetic energy to move fluids, rather than positive displacement mechanisms.

The examples all work through pressure differentials or kinetic energy conversion:
- Siphon uses atmospheric pressure differential
- Vacuum pump creates pressure differential by removing air
- Centrifugal pump converts rotational kinetic energy to pressure

The anti-examples include a positive displacement pump (diaphragm) and power generation devices (hydroelectric dam), which don't fit this specific theme.
