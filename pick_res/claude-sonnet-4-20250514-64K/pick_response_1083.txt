Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme about places named after people who were primarily known for their professional achievements in science, business, engineering, or technical fields, rather than for political leadership or founding roles.

Examples:
- Fermilab (Enrico Fermi - physicist)
- Rockefeller Center (John D. Rockefeller - businessman) 
- Hoover Dam (Herbert Hoover - engineer/businessman, though also president)

Anti-examples are all places named after political figures/founding fathers:
- Washington, D.C. (George Washington - founding father/president)
- Lincoln Memorial (Abraham Lincoln - president)
- Jefferson City (Thomas Jefferson - founding father/president)
