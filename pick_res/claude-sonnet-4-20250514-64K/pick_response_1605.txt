Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme about objects that undergo reversible changes - they deform or change when force is applied and automatically return to their original state when the force is removed. This is elastic behavior.

Let me evaluate each candidate:

<number>1</number><score>8</score>
<number>2</number><score>10</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>
<number>5</number><score>3</score>
<number>6</number><score>0</score>
<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>2</score>
