Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme by analyzing what distinguishes them from the anti-examples.

The examples (Inner Niger Delta, Peace-Athabasca Delta, Ili River Delta) are all inland deltas - deltas that form in continental interior settings where rivers flow into lakes, inland seas, or internal drainage systems rather than emptying directly into oceans.

The anti-examples include coastal deltas (Mississippi, Mekong) and a basin rather than a delta (Okavango Basin), which helps clarify that the specific theme is about inland deltas specifically.
