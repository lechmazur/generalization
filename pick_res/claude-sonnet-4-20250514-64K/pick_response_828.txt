Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: solitary experiences in cold environments that lead to profound personal insights or realizations.

Key elements:
- Cold environment/weather conditions
- Solitude/being alone  
- Gaining significant personal insight, clarity, or realization
- The insight is meaningful and often occurs suddenly during the cold, solitary experience
