Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme of textiles featuring geometric patterns - specifically tessellated, interlocking, and intricate geometric designs like stars, octagons, and diamonds. The anti-examples show textiles with non-geometric patterns (animals, florals, symbols), indicating the theme is specifically about geometric rather than organic or symbolic patterns.
