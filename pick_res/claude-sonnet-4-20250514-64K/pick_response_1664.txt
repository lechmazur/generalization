Looking at the examples (Trebuchet, Onager, Atlatl) versus anti-examples (Catapult, Crossbow, Longbow), I can identify the specific theme as weapons that use rotational leverage mechanisms to propel projectiles. All three examples employ a lever arm that rotates around a fulcrum to amplify throwing force, while the anti-examples either use different mechanisms (tension/compression for crossbow/longbow) or represent a broader category (catapult).
