Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- The phonautograph: converts sound waves to visual traces
- The electric guitar: converts acoustic vibrations to electrical signals  
- Magnetic tape recording: converts sound to magnetic patterns

Anti-examples:
- Gramophone: plays back recordings (doesn't convert acoustic input)
- Radio: transmits signals (doesn't convert acoustic sound initially)
- Telephone: real-time communication (not recording/amplification focused)

The specific theme appears to be: technologies that convert acoustic sound into another physical medium for recording, storage, or amplification.
