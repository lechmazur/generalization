Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples focus on: specific environmental components/media (biodiversity, ozone layer, wetlands) or specific substances affecting these components.

Anti-examples focus on: mobile/migratory species or global climate processes.

The theme appears to be environmental conventions targeting fixed environmental elements or specific chemical substances, rather than mobile species or climate change.
