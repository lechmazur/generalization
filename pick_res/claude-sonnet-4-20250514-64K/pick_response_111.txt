Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes them.

Examples show integrated systems with precise internal coordination:
- Ballet performance: unified artistic work with mechanical precision
- High-speed printing press: integrated mechanical system with coordinated parts
- Mechanical watch: integrated mechanical system with precise timing

Anti-examples show multiple separate entities with external coordination:
- Group of synchronized swimmers: separate individuals coordinating
- Group of synchronized clocks: separate objects synchronizing
- Fleet of drones: separate entities coordinating

The theme appears to be "integrated systems with precise internal mechanical coordination" versus "collections of separate entities with external coordination."
