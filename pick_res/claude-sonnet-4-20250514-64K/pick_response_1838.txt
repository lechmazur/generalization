Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what makes the Good Friday Agreement, Treaty of Versailles, and Dayton Agreement different from the Treaty of Trianon, Treaty of SÃ¨vres, and Treaty of Lausanne.

The examples are all major landmark peace agreements that ended significant conflicts and are widely studied in international relations - they ended active hostilities and are famous for their diplomatic significance. The anti-examples are all post-WWI technical treaties dealing with specific defeated countries' territorial arrangements, which are less famous and more specialized.
