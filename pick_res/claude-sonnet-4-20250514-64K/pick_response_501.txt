Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as: dry, absorbent, disposable products designed for soaking up or wiping up liquids/bodily fluids.

The examples (paper towels, Band-Aid adhesive bandages, Kleenex tissues) are all dry, flexible, absorbent materials specifically designed to absorb liquids for cleaning or personal care purposes.

The anti-examples help clarify the boundaries: plastic straws aren't absorbent, wet wipes are pre-moistened (not dry), and paper plates aren't designed for absorption.
