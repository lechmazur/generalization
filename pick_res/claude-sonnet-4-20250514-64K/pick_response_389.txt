Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify a pattern around sophisticated wireless communication technologies operating at VHF frequencies or higher, with advanced modulation techniques and reasonable bandwidth capabilities.

Examples use higher frequencies (VHF/UHF/SHF), more sophisticated protocols, and higher bandwidth compared to anti-examples which include lower frequency (HF/MF) and simpler technologies.
