Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as uniform truncated Platonic solids - these are the Archimedean solids formed by regular, uniform truncation of the five Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron). The anti-examples confirm this by showing truncated Platonic solids but with irregularities (unequal edges, irregular faces), indicating the theme requires uniformity and regularity.
