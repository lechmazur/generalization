Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what specifically distinguishes the examples (radio antenna, weather vane, church spire) from the anti-examples (lightning rod, wind turbine, satellite dish).

The examples are all tall, pointed/tapering vertical structures that extend upward and serve as landmarks, architectural features, or directional indicators. The anti-examples are excluded because they serve primarily protective functions (lightning rod), energy generation (wind turbine), or have different shapes (satellite dish).
