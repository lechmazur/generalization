Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as natural atmospheric optical phenomena - optical effects that occur naturally in the atmosphere due to environmental conditions like temperature gradients, water droplets, or ice crystals.

The anti-examples (kaleidoscope, prism, mirror) are all man-made optical devices, showing that the theme specifically excludes artificial optical instruments and focuses on natural atmospheric phenomena.
