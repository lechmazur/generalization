Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

The examples (dreamcatcher, crystal wand, shaman's drum) appear to be practical spiritual tools used for personal energy work, consciousness alteration, or spiritual protection - typically from indigenous or alternative spiritual traditions.

The anti-examples (prayer wheel, ritual dagger, statue of deity) seem to represent formal religious objects used for prayer, ceremony, or worship - from organized religious traditions.
