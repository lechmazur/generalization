Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- Mapusaurus: From Argentina, Cretaceous period, large carnivore
- Notocolossus: From Argentina, Cretaceous period, large herbivore  
- Giganotosaurus: From Argentina, Cretaceous period, large carnivore

Anti-examples:
- Tyrannosaurus rex: From North America, Cretaceous period, large carnivore
- Spinosaurus: From Africa, Cretaceous period, large carnivore
- Diplodocus: From North America, Jurassic period, large herbivore

The specific theme appears to be dinosaurs from Argentina/South America, while the broader theme that connects all examples and anti-examples is large, well-known dinosaurs.

I'll score based on:
- Primary factor: South American/Argentine origin (6 points)
- Secondary factors: Phylogenetic relationship to examples (0-2 points), temporal match (0-1 point), size similarity (0-1 point)
- Bonus considerations for particularly relevant characteristics
