Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as structures that project from riverbanks/shorelines into water bodies for the purpose of controlling water flow and managing sediment/erosion.

The anti-examples help clarify what this theme is NOT: structures that span entire waterways (weir, dam) or structures in water serving other purposes (bridge pier).
