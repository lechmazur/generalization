Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: clay incense holder, woven meditation mat, crystal healing wand
Anti-examples: bronze statue, gold amulet, steel ritual knife

The specific theme appears to be spiritual/meditation items made from natural materials (clay, woven fibers, crystal) versus the broader theme of spiritual items regardless of material (which includes metals like bronze, gold, steel).
