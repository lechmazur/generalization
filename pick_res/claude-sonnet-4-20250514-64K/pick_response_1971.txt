Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes Hermite polynomials, Bessel functions, and Airy function from Chebyshev polynomials, Legendre polynomials, and Gamma function.

The examples appear to be special functions that arise as solutions to differential equations in mathematical physics contexts, particularly those defined on infinite or semi-infinite domains or appearing in quantum mechanics and wave theory, as opposed to classical orthogonal polynomials on finite intervals or auxiliary functions.
