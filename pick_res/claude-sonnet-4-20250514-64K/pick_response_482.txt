Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme and evaluate each candidate accordingly.

The examples show black and white photographs of endangered/threatened species found in Florida (Florida panther, wood stork, West Indian manatee). The anti-examples help clarify that it's not just any Florida wildlife in black and white (great blue heron and alligators are not endangered/threatened) and not endangered species in any format (color Florida panther doesn't match).
