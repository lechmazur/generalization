Looking at the examples (hand drill, corkscrew, manual pencil sharpener), I can identify that they are all manual tools that require hand operation with rotational motion and have spiral/threaded mechanisms. The anti-examples (spiral galaxy, DNA double helix, fibonacci spiral) are all spiral patterns but lack the manual tool functionality.
