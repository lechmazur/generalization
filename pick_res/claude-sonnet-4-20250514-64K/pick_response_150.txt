Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify a specific theme related to particle detection devices used in physics experiments that create observable effects when particles interact with detection media.

The examples (scintillation detector, bubble chamber, Wilson cloud chamber) are all particle detection devices that produce visible traces or signals through particle-medium interactions. The anti-examples rule out general radiation detection (Geiger counter), optical components (telescope lens), and measurement instruments (barometer).
