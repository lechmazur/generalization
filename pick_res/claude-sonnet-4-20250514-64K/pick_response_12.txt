Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as natural cycles where substances or entities move through distinct transformational stages and return to their original state or form, completing a true cyclical process.

The examples show:
- Nitrogen cycling through different chemical forms (atmospheric nitrogen → ammonia → nitrites → nitrates → back to atmospheric nitrogen)
- Butterfly transformation through distinct developmental stages (egg → caterpillar → pupa → adult → back to egg through reproduction)  
- Carbon cycling through different reservoirs and forms in the environment

The anti-examples are excluded because they represent either linear processes (food chain) or life cycles that may be less dramatically transformational than the complete metamorphosis shown in the butterfly example.
