Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify a specific theme around passive detection devices that sense invisible environmental phenomena for monitoring/safety purposes.

The examples (Geiger counter, infrared thermometer, smoke detector) all passively detect invisible environmental conditions for monitoring, while the anti-examples either actively generate signals (X-ray machine, radar gun) or serve different purposes (night vision for vision enhancement).
