Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes the specific theme from the broader related themes.

The examples (Shangri-La, Laputa, El Dorado) appear to represent legendary places that embody fundamental human aspirations across three classical domains:
- Spiritual perfection/enlightenment (Shangri-La)
- Intellectual/technological mastery (Laputa) 
- Material abundance/wealth (El Dorado)

The anti-examples, while also being legendary hidden places, represent more specific or limited concepts rather than these universal human ideals.
