Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme: devices that operate through concealed/hidden mechanisms where the primary functionality relies on parts that are not visible to the user.

The examples show:
- Automatic door with concealed sensors and motors
- Safe with hidden lock mechanism  
- Magic trick with hidden compartment

The anti-examples show devices with visible/exposed mechanisms:
- Glass elevator showing internal workings
- Computer with clear case showing components
- Clock with exposed mechanical parts
