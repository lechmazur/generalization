Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

The examples (silkscreen frame, palette knife, camera obscura) are all traditional tools used in 2D fine art processes that involve controlled application or projection of artistic mediums. The anti-examples represent photography equipment, sculpture tools, and textile machinery - which are either from different artistic fields or more modern/complex equipment.
