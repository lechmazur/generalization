Looking at the examples (human heart, glass, dandelion) and anti-examples (egg, feather, spider web), I need to identify what specific theme connects the examples but excludes the anti-examples.

The examples all share the property of being able to undergo sudden, complete, irreversible transformation - a heart can suddenly stop, glass can shatter instantly, and a dandelion can have all its seeds blown away in one breath. The anti-examples don't fit this pattern as well: an egg can crack but often remains partially intact, a feather doesn't undergo sudden complete transformation, and a spider web can be torn but often survives partially and can be repaired.
