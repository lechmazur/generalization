Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme about transitional elements that bridge or connect distinct parts, entities, or states - like musical interludes bridging movements, cross-fades joining scenes, and diplomatic envoys mediating between conflicting parties.

The anti-examples focus on communication and delivery functions rather than transitional bridging, which helps clarify what doesn't match the specific theme.
