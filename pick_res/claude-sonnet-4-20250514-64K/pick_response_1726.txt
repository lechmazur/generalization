Looking at the examples, I need to identify what makes The Berlin Wall, The Declaration of Independence, and The Rosetta Stone similar, while distinguishing them from the anti-examples (a historic treaty, a famous speech, a national flag).

The examples are all specific, named historical artifacts of tremendous world-historical significance, while the anti-examples are generic categories that could contain important items but lack specificity.
