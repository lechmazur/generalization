Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme around objects that facilitate introspection, self-discovery, and reflection on personal growth/transformation. The examples are tools that help protagonists understand themselves and track their inner development.

The anti-examples focus on external movement, travel, and access to external spaces rather than internal reflection.
