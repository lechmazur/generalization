Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: bass guitars with two humbucker pickups and a minimalist control layout consisting of exactly one volume knob and one tone knob.

The anti-examples show that while having two humbuckers is part of a broader theme, the specific theme requires simple controls (not EQs, blend controls, or multiple separate controls).
