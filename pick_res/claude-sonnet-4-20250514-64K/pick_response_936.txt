Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- Treaty of Versailles: Post-WWI settlement with territorial changes and arrangements
- Camp David Accords: Peace agreement involving territorial resolution (Sinai Peninsula)
- Treaty of Tordesillas: Territorial division agreement between Spain and Portugal

Anti-examples:
- Good Friday Agreement: Peace process focused on governance sharing
- Helsinki Accords: Security and cooperation principles
- North Atlantic Treaty: Military alliance formation

The specific theme appears to be treaties that establish, modify, or settle territorial arrangements, boundaries, or sovereignty claims.
