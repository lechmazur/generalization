Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as computational/algorithmic mathematical methods and elementary mathematical functions, as opposed to probabilistic/stochastic concepts shown in the anti-examples.

The examples include iterative algorithms (Gauss-Seidel method, Newton's method) and an elementary number theory function (Euler's totient function), while the anti-examples are all from probability theory and statistics.
