Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: specialized containers designed to organize specific types of items related to particular activities or hobbies. The examples show tackle boxes for fishing lures, jewelry organizers for accessories, and spice racks for cooking ingredients - all purpose-built organizers for specific collections.

The anti-examples (filing cabinet, suitcase, backpack) represent general-purpose storage containers that aren't specialized for specific hobby or activity-related items.
