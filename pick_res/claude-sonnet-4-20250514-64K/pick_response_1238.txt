Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme. The examples are all specific, iconic geological formations created by natural erosional/weathering processes (wind erosion for sand dunes, water erosion for the Grand Canyon, chemical dissolution for limestone cave formations). The anti-examples are general landform categories rather than specific, named formations.
