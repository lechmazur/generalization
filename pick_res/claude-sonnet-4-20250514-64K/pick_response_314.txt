Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: hand-built ceramic objects with physical game pieces or game elements incorporated into the ceramic structure itself (like dominoes forming texture, game pieces built into handles/spouts, tiles embedded in clay).

The anti-examples help clarify what doesn't match: pure game collections without ceramic, ceramic objects with separate/held game elements, or game sculptures without ceramic.
