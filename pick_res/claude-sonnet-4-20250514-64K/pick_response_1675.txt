Looking at the three examples, I can identify a specific theme of experimental avant-garde documentaries from the 1920s-1930s that capture the rhythm and energy of modern urban/industrial life through innovative cinematography and editing techniques, often structured like musical symphonies.

The anti-examples help clarify this is not about animated films with musical elements, nor narrative films about modern life, but specifically about documentary-style experimental films from the European avant-garde movement.
