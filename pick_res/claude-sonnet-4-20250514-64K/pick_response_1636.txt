Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme involving complex/fractal patterns or structures that occur specifically in saline or marine environments (coastal saline waters, salt marshes, hypersaline lagoons). The anti-examples show similar fractal/branching patterns but in non-marine environments (freshwater rivers, atmospheric phenomena).
