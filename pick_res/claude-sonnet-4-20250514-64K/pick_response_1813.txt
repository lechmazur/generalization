Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as: Pet shelter structures made from large repurposed/reclaimed items (pallets, tires, shipping crates).

The anti-examples show the broader theme of: Pet items made from recycled materials (but not necessarily shelter structures or large repurposed items).

I need to score based on how well candidates match the specific theme, not just the broader theme.
