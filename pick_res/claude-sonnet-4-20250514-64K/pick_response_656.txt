Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: Darwin's theory of evolution, Einstein's theory of relativity, Maxwell's equations
Anti-examples: Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, Boyle's law, Hooke's law

The examples are comprehensive, revolutionary scientific frameworks that unified broad domains of natural phenomena and fundamentally changed entire fields of study. The anti-examples are specific laws describing particular relationships or phenomena.
