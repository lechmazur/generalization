Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as wooden containers used for aging spirits. The examples all feature wood materials (cherry, acacia, oak), aging/maturing processes, and distilled spirits (rum, brandy, whiskey). The anti-examples show non-wood materials, different purposes (fermenting, dispensing, storing), and different beverages (beer, wine).
