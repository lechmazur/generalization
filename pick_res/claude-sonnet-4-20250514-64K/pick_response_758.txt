Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: systems that combine real-time data processing with user interaction/feedback to actively optimize or adjust their operations and decisions.

The examples all show:
- Real-time data processing
- User interaction that influences system decisions
- Active optimization/adjustment based on both inputs

The anti-examples all lack the user interaction component that influences decision-making.
