Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as: peaceful/contemplative spaces that provide quiet refuge within busy environments.

The examples show:
- Japanese Zen garden (contemplative space) in a city park (urban setting)
- Library reading room with soundproofing (quiet space isolated from external noise)
- Chapel (peaceful space) in an airport terminal (busy environment)

The anti-examples are just busy spaces without the peaceful refuge element.
