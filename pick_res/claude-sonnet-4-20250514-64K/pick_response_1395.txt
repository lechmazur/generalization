Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify that the theme relates to American philanthropic institutions founded by pioneering industrial magnates of the early-to-mid 20th century who established systematic approaches to philanthropy and research.

The examples (Rockefeller Institute, Carnegie Institution, Kellogg Foundation) were all founded by legendary American industrialists who pioneered modern systematic philanthropy, while the anti-examples either came from later eras, different countries, or founders who were less central to establishing philanthropic traditions.
