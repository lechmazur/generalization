Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as formal ceremonial events that mark significant transitions in natural cycles or major life stages.

The examples (graduation ceremony, winter solstice celebration, harvest festival) all involve formal ceremonies marking meaningful transitions - educational completion, seasonal/astronomical events, and agricultural cycles.

The anti-examples help clarify what doesn't fit: arbitrary calendar transitions (new year's eve) and entertainment/performance endings (season finale, grand finale).
