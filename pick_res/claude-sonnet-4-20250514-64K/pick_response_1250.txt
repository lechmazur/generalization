Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes the specific theme.

Examples: funhouse mirror, kaleidoscope, magnifying glass
Anti-examples: prism, microscope, hologram

The examples appear to be simple, immediate optical devices/effects that transform visual perception in obvious ways, typically for entertainment, wonder, or basic practical use. The anti-examples are more scientific, technical, or complex optical devices.
