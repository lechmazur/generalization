Looking at the examples, I can identify a pattern of systems involving sudden, violent pressure releases or explosive events:
- Pressure cooker: potential for explosive pressure release
- Combustion engine cylinder: rapid explosive combustion cycles  
- Volcanic eruption: sudden violent release of pressure and material

The anti-examples all involve controlled pressure/heat systems designed for steady operation rather than sudden releases.
