Looking at the examples (stage, treehouse, watchtower) versus the anti-examples (catwalk, terrace, deck), I can identify the specific theme as elevated structures that serve as purpose-built bases for specific activities where the elevation is essential to their function.

The examples are standalone elevated structures designed for particular activities (performing, dwelling, observing), while the anti-examples are more general-purpose elevated surfaces or building features.
