Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: cast iron skillet, glass milk bottle, kerosene lantern
Anti-examples: manual egg beater, hand-cranked ice cream maker, wind-up alarm clock

The examples are all simple traditional household items that function through basic physical principles without complex mechanical systems. The anti-examples are traditional items but require complex mechanisms, gears, or mechanical manipulation to function.
