Looking at the examples, I can identify a theme related to systems that work through suspension, dampening, or dynamic mechanisms rather than rigid structural compression.

The examples (shock absorber, lava lamp, suspension bridge) all involve dynamic systems - energy absorption, suspended elements in liquid, and tension-based suspension. The anti-examples (brick foundation, stone pillar, concrete wall) are all solid, rigid, static compression structures.
