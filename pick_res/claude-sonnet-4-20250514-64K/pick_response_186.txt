Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: Annie Lennox, Kate Bush, Madonna
Anti-examples: Grace Jones, Debbie Harry, Pat Benatar

The examples appear to be female artists who achieved major success during the prime MTV era (1983-1985) with sophisticated, artistic pop music and strong visual presentation, finding the sweet spot between artistic credibility and commercial accessibility. The anti-examples are from slightly earlier periods or lean too far toward either pure avant-garde art (Grace Jones) or more traditional rock/pop (Debbie Harry, Pat Benatar).
