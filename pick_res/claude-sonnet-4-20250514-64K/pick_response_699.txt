Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as traditional ceremonial tools/implements made from organic natural materials and used functionally in indigenous cultural practices.

Examples analysis:
- Tibetan prayer beads: organic material (bodhi seeds), functional tool, specific traditional culture
- Japanese bamboo tea whisk: organic material (bamboo), functional tool, specific traditional culture  
- Native American eagle feather fan: organic material (feather), functional tool, specific traditional culture

Anti-examples analysis:
- Modern dreamcatcher: "modern" suggests not authentic traditional
- Stone sculpture of Buddha: inorganic material, sculpture (not functional tool)
- Celtic cross necklace: likely inorganic material, jewelry (not ceremonial tool)
