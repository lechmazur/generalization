Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme:

Examples: Heat sealer, Hot glue gun, Plastic welding gun
Anti-examples: Welding torch, Stapler, Rivet gun

The theme appears to be handheld electric tools that use controlled heat for bonding/sealing materials. The anti-examples are excluded because welding torch uses high-intensity gas heat for heavy-duty metal work, while stapler and rivet gun use mechanical fastening without heat.
