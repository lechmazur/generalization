Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as natural objects or phenomena that are well-known for having prominent, visible spiral patterns.

The examples (spiral galaxy, nautilus shell, sunflower seed head) are all specific natural entities famous for their spiral structures, while the anti-examples are either too general/conditional (snail shell - only some species) or abstract mathematical concepts (golden ratio, Fibonacci sequence) rather than physical spiral objects.
