Looking at the examples, I can identify they all represent natural biological systems or processes:
- The lymphatic system: biological system within organisms
- The carbon cycle: natural biogeochemical cycle involving biological processes  
- A coral reef ecosystem: natural biological community

The anti-examples are systems but not specifically biological (circular economy is human-made economic, river system is geological/hydrological, weather system is atmospheric/meteorological).
