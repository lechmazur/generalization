Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme by analyzing what distinguishes the three examples from the three anti-examples.

The examples (Roy Harris, Aaron Copland, Henry Cowell) were all American-born composers who developed modernist and experimental compositional techniques to create distinctly American art music during the early-to-mid 20th century. They were part of the American "ultra-modern" or experimental classical music movement.

The anti-examples (William Grant Still, George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein), while also American composers, represent different approaches: Still focused on African American musical traditions, Gershwin bridged classical and popular/jazz idioms, and Bernstein was known for Broadway and theatrical works alongside his classical compositions.
