Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as: physical architectural spaces where solving sequential puzzles is mandatory to unlock and progress through connected areas/rooms.

The key elements are:
- Physical architectural structures/spaces
- Sequential puzzles that must be solved
- Mandatory solving required for progression
- Unlocking access to new areas/rooms
- Movement restriction until puzzles are solved
