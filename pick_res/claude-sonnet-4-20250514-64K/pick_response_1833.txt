Looking at the examples, I can identify they all relate to neutron radiation shielding materials - aluminum-boron composites (boron absorbs neutrons), water-filled compartments (hydrogen moderates neutrons), and polyethylene panels (hydrogen-rich for neutron shielding). The anti-examples represent general radiation protection structures rather than specific neutron shielding materials.
