Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: Enigma, Odyssey, Apollo
Anti-examples: Eclipse, Oracle, Phantom

The examples are all single-word names that are primarily famous for being major historical programs/projects (Enigma cipher machine, Odyssey space missions, Apollo space program). The anti-examples are single words primarily known for other things (natural phenomena, companies, concepts) even though they might also be used as program names.
