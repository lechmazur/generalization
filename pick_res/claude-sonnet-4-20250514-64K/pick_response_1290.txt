Looking at the examples (war medal, grandfather clock, weathervane) and anti-examples (flag, coin, statue), I can identify the specific theme as traditional functional objects that serve specialized practical purposes - such as measurement, indication, or recognition - and are often valuable or collectible. The anti-examples are excluded because they serve more general symbolic, transactional, or purely artistic functions.
