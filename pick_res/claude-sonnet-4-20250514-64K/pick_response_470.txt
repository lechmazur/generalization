Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as Archimedean solids created by vertex truncation of Platonic solids. The examples (truncated tetrahedron, truncated cube, truncated octahedron) are all formed by cutting off the vertices of regular polyhedra. The anti-examples are Archimedean solids created by different operations like rectification and cantellation.
