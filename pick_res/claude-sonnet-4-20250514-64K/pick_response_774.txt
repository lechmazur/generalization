Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: materials that undergo fundamental structural or physical property transformations in response to external stimuli. The examples show magnetorheological fluids changing viscosity, self-healing polymers restructuring molecular bonds, and photonic crystals altering optical properties through structural changes.

The anti-examples help clarify that system-level adaptations (even sophisticated ones) and surface-level property changes don't match this specific theme.
