Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

The examples (Taj Mahal, Great Pyramid of Giza, Parthenon) are all pre-modern monuments that represent the architectural pinnacles of their respective civilizations and have achieved the highest level of global cultural recognition.

The anti-examples help clarify the boundaries: Sagrada Familia and Louvre Pyramid are too modern, while the Pantheon, though ancient, may not represent THE definitive architectural symbol of Roman civilization compared to other Roman monuments.
