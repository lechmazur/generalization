Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes the first group from the second.

The examples (Matmos, Mira Calix, Aphex Twin) all create ambient/atmospheric electronic music, often incorporating experimental approaches and non-electronic elements like field recordings. The anti-examples (Autechre, Squarepusher, Kraftwerk) represent more rhythm-focused, structured, or algorithmic electronic music approaches.
