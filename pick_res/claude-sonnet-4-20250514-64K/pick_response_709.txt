Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme by analyzing the patterns:

Examples:
- Telegraph: 1840s foundational electrical communication breakthrough
- Steam locomotive: Early 1800s foundational steam-powered rail transport
- First satellite: 1957 foundational space achievement

Anti-examples: 
- GPS: 1980s-1990s technology building on existing satellites
- Internet: Later era network evolution from existing systems  
- VR: Recent technology building on existing computers

The specific theme appears to be foundational technological breakthroughs from the earlier industrial era (roughly 1800s-1950s) that opened entirely new domains, rather than later evolutionary developments.
