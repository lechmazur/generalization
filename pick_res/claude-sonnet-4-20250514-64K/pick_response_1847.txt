Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what specifically distinguishes Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, and Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle from Harry Langdon, Laurel and Hardy, and Max Linder.

The examples appear to be the most iconic and influential solo silent film comedians who are still widely recognized today as the "Big Three" of silent comedy. The anti-examples include a duo (Laurel and Hardy), a less universally acclaimed solo comedian (Harry Langdon), and an earlier/European figure (Max Linder).
