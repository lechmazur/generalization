Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: desiccated mushroom, mummified animal in desert, preserved insect in dry environment
Anti-examples: dried seaweed sheet, dried herb for cooking, mummified pharaoh

The specific theme appears to be: naturally preserved non-human organisms through environmental desiccation (not processed for human use or intentionally preserved).
