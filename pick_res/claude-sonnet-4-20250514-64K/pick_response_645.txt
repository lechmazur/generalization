Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: supernatural beings associated with particular natural or traditional domains who aid those who properly respect these domains according to traditional rules, but punish those who violate the natural/traditional boundaries or customs of those domains.

The anti-examples differ by focusing on personal betrayals, general moral violations, or less domain-specific relationships rather than the specific traditional/environmental respect pattern.
