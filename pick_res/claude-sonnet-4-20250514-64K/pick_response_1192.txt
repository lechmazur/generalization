Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify that the specific theme relates to systems or phenomena characterized by instability, volatility, or susceptibility to dramatic change/collapse, as opposed to stable and reliable systems.

The examples (economic bubble, stock market, political regime) all represent systems prone to dramatic shifts, volatility, or sudden collapse. The anti-examples (stable government, robust economy, reliable power grid) emphasize stability and reliability.
