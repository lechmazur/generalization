Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what makes Venice, Three Gorges Dam, and Hoover Dam similar while distinguishing them from artificial islands, Panama Canal, and levees.

The examples all involve places where water has displaced or flooded significant land areas: Venice has water in place of streets, while both dams created massive reservoirs by flooding valleys and canyons. The anti-examples either create land (artificial island), connect existing water bodies without major flooding (Panama Canal), or prevent flooding (levee).
