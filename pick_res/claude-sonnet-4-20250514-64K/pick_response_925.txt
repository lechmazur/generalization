Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as mechanical timekeeping devices - physical instruments that measure time through mechanical means.

The examples show:
- Harrison H4 marine chronometer (mechanical precision timekeeper)
- Water clock in ancient Egypt (mechanical device using water flow) 
- First mechanical tower clock (early mechanical public timekeeper)

The anti-examples help clarify what's excluded:
- Pendulum (component, not complete device)
- Mayan Long Count calendar (calendar system, not physical device)
- Atomic clock (electronic/atomic, not mechanical)
