Looking at the examples (Halter, Riding crop, Saddle) versus anti-examples (Harness, Girth, Bit), I can identify the specific theme as standalone pieces of equestrian equipment, as opposed to components of larger systems or multi-part assemblies.

The examples are individual, complete items that can function independently, while the anti-examples are either complex systems (harness) or components that only function as part of larger assemblies (girth with saddle, bit with bridle).
