Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: medieval liturgical objects made of precious materials (gold, silver, ivory, gems) that were used in Christian religious ceremonies.

The anti-examples help clarify what doesn't fit: architectural religious art (mosaics, cathedral ornamentation) and religious manuscripts made of non-precious materials, even though they share some characteristics like being medieval, religious, or decorative.
