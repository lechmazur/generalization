Looking at the examples, I can identify a pattern of early landmark sports cars from European manufacturers in the classic era (1940s-1960s). These were foundational models that established or re-established their manufacturers' identities in the sports car world.

The anti-examples fail this pattern because they're either from the modern era (Pagani Zonda, Koenigsegg Agera) or American with limited production (Tucker 48).
