Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples: paper safe, print tongs, film drying rack
Anti-examples: print washer, enlarger, print roller

The examples are all passive darkroom equipment that supports, contains, or handles photographic materials without actively processing them. The anti-examples are active processing equipment that wash, enlarge, or flatten materials.
