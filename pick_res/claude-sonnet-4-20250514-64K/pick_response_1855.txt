Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as topological objects and spaces - mathematical constructs studied in topology.

The examples are:
- MÃ¶bius strip: a non-orientable topological surface
- Hilbert cube: an infinite-dimensional topological space  
- Klein bottle: a non-orientable closed topological surface

The anti-examples are mathematical concepts named after mathematicians but from non-topological fields (coordinate systems, probability, numerical methods), which could mislead toward the broader theme of "mathematical concepts named after people."
