Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as geometric tessellations and tilings - patterns where geometric shapes systematically cover a plane or surface.

The examples show:
- Diatom shells: intricate geometric patterns that tessellate
- M.C. Escher tessellations: artistic geometric patterns that interlock and repeat
- Penrose tiling: mathematical non-periodic tilings

The anti-examples represent different pattern types:
- Natural functional structures (beehive)
- Fractal patterns (Romanesco)  
- Natural spiral/growth patterns (sunflower)
