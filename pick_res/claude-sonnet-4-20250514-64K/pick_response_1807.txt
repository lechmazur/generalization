Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific pattern that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- UNCTAD (6 letters)
- EFTA (4 letters) 
- GATT (4 letters)

Anti-examples:
- WTO (3 letters)
- NAFTA (5 letters)
- ASEAN FTA (3 letters for FTA)

The key pattern appears to be that all examples have an even number of letters in their acronyms (6, 4, 4), while all anti-examples have an odd number of letters (3, 5, 3).

Evaluating candidates based on their standard acronyms:

<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>6</score>
<number>4</number><score>7</score>
<number>5</number><score>4</score>
<number>6</number><score>2</score>
<number>7</number><score>8</score>
<number>8</number><score>9</score>
