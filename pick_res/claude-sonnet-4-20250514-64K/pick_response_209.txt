Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme related to musical instruments made from plant-based materials:
- Gourd (plant material)
- Wood (plant material) 
- Bamboo (plant material)

The anti-examples are all metal instruments, which while still musical instruments, don't fit the specific theme of plant-based materials.
