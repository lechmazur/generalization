Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes them.

Examples: fireworks display, nuclear reactor meltdown, smoke signal
Anti-examples: lightning strike, campfire, geyser

The examples all involve engineered/artificial systems with controlled chemical or nuclear processes that produce specific emissions or energy releases, while the anti-examples are either natural phenomena or simple combustion processes.
