Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as: **Using advanced mathematical/statistical methods for prediction/modeling tasks when explicitly dealing with problematic data quality (noisy, limited, incomplete, sparse data)**.

The examples all contain three key elements:
1. A prediction/forecasting/modeling task
2. An advanced mathematical/statistical method (machine learning, stochastic processes, Bayesian inference)
3. Explicitly mentioned data quality issues (noisy, limited, incomplete)
