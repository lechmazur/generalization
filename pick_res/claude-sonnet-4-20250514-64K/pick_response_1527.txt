Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify that the specific theme is gemstones that naturally display two distinct colors in separate, well-defined zones within the same stone (bicolor zoning).

The examples all show clear bicolor zoning:
- Bicolor sapphire: Two distinct color zones
- Bicolor topaz: Two distinct color zones  
- Ametrine: Purple and yellow zones

The anti-examples show why related but different phenomena don't qualify:
- Agate: Color patterns/banding rather than distinct bicolor zones
- Labradorite: Optical iridescence effects, not actual color zones
- Tiger's eye: Chatoyancy and fibrous patterns, not bicolor zoning
