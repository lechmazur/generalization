Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes the specific theme.

Examples: The wheel, Penicillin, The printing press
Anti-examples: The transistor, The light bulb, The steam engine

The examples appear to be inventions commonly ranked among the most fundamental and important inventions in human history - those that fundamentally transformed civilization and are frequently cited in educational contexts as pivotal human achievements. The anti-examples, while very important, may not consistently reach the very top tier of such historical rankings.
