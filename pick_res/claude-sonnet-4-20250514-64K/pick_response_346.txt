Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: items made from natural plant-based materials that are used in their naturally flexible, fibrous, or pliable state, with construction methods that take advantage of these natural properties (weaving, bending, braiding, etc.).

The anti-examples are misleading because they include outdoor/garden items and natural materials, but they use processed materials (metal, plastic) or solid wood construction that doesn't utilize natural flexibility.
