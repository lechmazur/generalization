Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what specific characteristics distinguish the examples (sea cucumber, banana slug, Spanish slug) from the anti-examples (snail, garden snail, octopus).

The examples are all soft-bodied animals with elongated body forms that lack hard external structures and move primarily through body contractions. The anti-examples either have shells (snails) or have a different body plan (octopus with head and tentacles).
