Looking at the examples (centric diatom, pennate diatom, diatom), the specific theme is clearly "diatoms" - either specific types or the general taxonomic group.

The anti-examples (radiolarian, foraminifera, coccolithophore) represent marine protists/microorganisms that are NOT diatoms, showing the broader theme of marine microorganisms.
