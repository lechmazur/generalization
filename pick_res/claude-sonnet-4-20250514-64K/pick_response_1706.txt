Looking at the examples (RuPaul, Andy Warhol, David Bowie) and anti-examples (Leigh Bowery, Marcel Duchamp, Vivienne Westwood), I can identify a specific theme involving artists who achieved mainstream pop culture icon status while challenging conventional gender/sexuality norms.

The examples all became household names while presenting non-conventional gender or sexual identity, whereas the anti-examples either lacked mainstream crossover success or didn't challenge gender/sexuality conventions.
