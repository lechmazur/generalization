Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme and score each candidate accordingly.

The examples (water purification system, oil refinery, espresso machine) all involve processing/transformation systems that take raw inputs and convert them into refined or processed outputs through some form of treatment or processing.

The anti-examples (mail sorting facility, sorting machine, library catalog) involve organization and sorting systems that arrange or categorize items without transforming their fundamental nature.
