Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify a pattern around space exploration missions that became legendary for dramatically exceeding their planned operational lifetimes in unexpected ways, particularly from earlier eras of space exploration.

The examples (Opportunity, Viking 1, Voyager 1) all dramatically outlasted their planned missions and became iconic, while the anti-examples (Curiosity, Cassini, Perseverance) are more modern missions where longevity is more expected or missions that completed roughly as planned.
