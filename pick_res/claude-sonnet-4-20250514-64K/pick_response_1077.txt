Looking at the examples, I need to identify the specific theme:

Examples:
- Whispering Gallery: Architectural features with special acoustic properties where whispers can travel along curved surfaces
- Moaning Cavern: A cave that produces moaning sounds due to its structure and airflow
- Booming Dunes: Sand dunes that create booming sounds when sand moves due to special acoustic properties

Anti-examples:
- Thunder: Natural sound phenomenon but not tied to a specific place with special acoustic properties
- Niagara Falls: A place that makes sound, but just normal water falling, not special acoustic phenomena
- Victoria Falls: Same as Niagara Falls

The specific theme appears to be: Places or geographical/architectural features that are named after distinctive sounds they produce due to special acoustic properties.
