Looking at the examples, I can identify a theme around rotational movement as a primary operational function:

- Car tire: rotates around its central axis during operation
- Kitchen cabinet door: rotates around hinges during operation  
- Camera lens: rotates around its axis for focusing/zooming during operation

The anti-examples don't involve rotation as their primary operational mechanism (light bulb only rotates during installation, others don't rotate at all).
