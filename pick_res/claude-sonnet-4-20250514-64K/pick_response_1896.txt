Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what specifically distinguishes items associated with ancient Greek theater from more general ancient Greek/Roman cultural items.

The examples (kothornoi, mask, chiton) are specifically associated with ancient Greek theatrical performance, while the anti-examples (laurel wreath, lyre, toga) are more generally cultural items that could potentially have theatrical connections but aren't specifically theatrical.
