Looking at the examples (Nelson Mandela, JFK, Mahatma Gandhi) versus the anti-examples (MLK, Confucius, Einstein), I need to identify what specifically distinguishes these groups.

The examples all held or were positioned to hold supreme political authority in their nations - Mandela as President of South Africa, JFK as President of the United States, and Gandhi as the de facto supreme leader of India's independence movement who was offered but declined formal political office. The anti-examples, while influential leaders, never held such supreme political authority.
