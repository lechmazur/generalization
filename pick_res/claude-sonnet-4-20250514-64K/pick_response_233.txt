Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as public installations or structures featuring non-Euclidean geometric forms that allow for physical human interaction and engagement.

The examples all feature:
- Public/community spaces
- Non-Euclidean geometry (twisting surfaces, curved non-linear walls, MÃ¶bius strip)  
- Direct physical interaction (climbing, navigating, sitting and interacting)

The anti-examples emphasize Euclidean shapes, conventional designs, and simple geometric forms as the key differentiator.
