Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme: topological invariants - mathematical quantities that remain unchanged under continuous deformations and characterize topological properties of spaces or objects.

The examples (linking number, Chern number, winding number) are all integer-valued topological invariants that measure winding, linking, or twisting phenomena. The anti-examples (symmetry group, fractal dimension, metric tensor) are mathematical concepts from related fields but are not topological invariants.
