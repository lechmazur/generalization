Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

The examples (metal trash can lids, wooden crates, metal graters) are all everyday utilitarian objects with systematic functional surface textures that can be repurposed as percussion instruments. The anti-examples (washboard, steel drums, coconut shells) are objects that are primarily known as musical instruments or commonly used for music, which makes them misleading.
