Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: ordinary objects that reveal hidden aesthetic/sensory features through natural interactions (filling a mug reveals color change, tilting a frame projects an image, opening a book releases fragrance).

The anti-examples represent functional/safety devices that respond to stimuli, which is a broader theme but lacks the disguise and aesthetic elements.
