Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what specific theme the examples share that distinguishes them from the broader category represented by the anti-examples.

The examples are automated machines that perform standardized, complete operations or services with appropriate complexity - not too simple like conveyor systems, not too complex/adaptive like self-driving cars, and not too variable/custom like CNC machines.
