Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as machine-readable patterns and optical scanning technology. The examples all involve either visual patterns designed to be scanned by devices (QR codes, AR markers) or devices that scan/read patterns (fingerprint scanner). The anti-examples are digital technologies that don't primarily involve this type of pattern recognition or scanning.
