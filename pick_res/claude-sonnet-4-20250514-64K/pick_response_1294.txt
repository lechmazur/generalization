Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as ancient/traditional physical information recording and storage systems used by historical civilizations.

The three examples show:
- Physical materials (wax, knotted strings, birch bark)
- Ancient/traditional origins (Roman, Inca, Ojibwe)
- Information recording/preservation purposes

The anti-examples clarify that modern digital systems for information sharing/preservation don't match this specific theme, even though they serve similar broader functions.
