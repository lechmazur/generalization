Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- Malacca (Malaysian pidgin)
- Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka Portuguese creole) 
- Fort Marlborough (Bencoolen pidgin)

These all represent pidgins/creoles that developed at European colonial trading posts and settlements in the Asian/Indian Ocean maritime region.

Anti-examples:
- Mediterranean Lingua Franca: Regional lingua franca, not tied to specific Asian colonial settlements
- Goa: Right regional/colonial context but no language specified
- Chinook Jargon: Contact language but wrong geographic region, not Asian colonial context

The specific theme appears to be: **Contact languages (pidgins/creoles) associated with European colonial trading settlements in the Asian/Indian Ocean region**.
