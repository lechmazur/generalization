Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as luxury/ornamental objects given as diplomatic gifts between political rulers or nations, with specific historical context.

The examples all feature:
- Physical luxury/ornamental objects (bejeweled sword, silver nef, mechanical clock)
- Given as diplomatic gifts between named rulers
- Specific historical instances with dates
- Ceremonial/decorative rather than purely functional purpose

The anti-examples help clarify what doesn't fit: mundane items (livestock), religious institutional contexts (church), or scientific institutional contexts (botanical garden).
