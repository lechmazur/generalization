Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- Ingapirca: Inca fortress in Ecuador
- Kuelap: Chachapoya fortress/citadel in Peru  
- Pukara de Quitor: Atacameño fortress in Chile ("pukara" means fortress)

Anti-examples:
- Tiwanaku: Major ceremonial center in Bolivia
- Ollantaytambo: Inca administrative center/town in Peru
- Chan Chan: Chimú capital city in Peru

The specific theme appears to be pre-Columbian fortresses/fortified sites, as opposed to the broader theme of pre-Columbian archaeological sites in general (which includes cities, ceremonial centers, and administrative centers).
