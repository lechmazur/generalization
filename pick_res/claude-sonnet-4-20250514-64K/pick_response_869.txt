Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

The examples (Alcubierre drive, gravitational lensing, wormholes) all involve spacetime phenomena that can be utilized to create alternative pathways or enable advanced transportation methods. The anti-examples (gravitational waves, spacetime curvature, time dilation) are standard relativistic concepts that don't provide practical transportation applications or alternative routing through space.
