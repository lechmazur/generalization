Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme as: ukiyo-e prints of Mount Fuji with native Japanese plants.

The examples all feature famous ukiyo-e works showing Mount Fuji (directly or from locations known for Fuji views) combined with native Japanese flora. The anti-examples confirm this by showing what happens when you change the plant type (non-native), the mountain (different mountain), or keep only partial elements.
