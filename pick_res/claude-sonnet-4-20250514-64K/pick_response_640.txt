Looking at the examples (Tea, Salt, Copper) and anti-examples (Spices, Glass beads, Silver), I can identify that the specific theme appears to be "things that were historically used as currency or medium of exchange, but are not precious metals."

The examples all served as currency: tea bricks, salt as payment (salary comes from salt), and copper as base metal currency. The anti-examples were either trade goods that weren't currency (spices, glass beads) or precious metal currency (silver).
