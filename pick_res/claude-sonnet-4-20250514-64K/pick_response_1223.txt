Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: objects made from animal bones that are used in spiritual/ceremonial/ritual contexts.

Key criteria:
1. Made from animal bones (primary material)
2. Used in spiritual/ceremonial/ritual contexts

The anti-examples help clarify that the theme is specifically about bone material (not stone, ivory, or wood) used ceremonially.
