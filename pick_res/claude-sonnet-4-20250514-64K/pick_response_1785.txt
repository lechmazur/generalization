Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples:
- magnetic tape drive
- FORTRAN programming language  
- magnetic core memory

Anti-examples:
- punch card system
- integrated circuit
- COBOL programming language

The examples all appear to be foundational technologies specifically developed for electronic computers during the mid-1950s era (roughly 1954-1957) that became dominant standards in their respective domains. The anti-examples either predate this era (punch cards), come from a later era (integrated circuits), or are slightly outside this specific timeframe (COBOL from 1959).
