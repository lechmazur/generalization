Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that unites the examples while distinguishing them from the anti-examples.

Examples:
- Chrysaora quinquecirrha (sea nettle)
- Phacellophora camtschatica (fried egg jellyfish) 
- Aurelia aurita (moon jelly)

These are all scyphozoan jellyfish (class Scyphozoa within phylum Cnidaria).

Anti-examples:
- Pyrosoma (colonial tunicate)
- Salpa (tunicate) 
- Doliolum (tunicate)

These are all tunicates - marine organisms that can be gelatinous and planktonic like jellyfish, but belong to phylum Chordata rather than Cnidaria.

The specific theme appears to be scyphozoan jellyfish (class Scyphozoa).
