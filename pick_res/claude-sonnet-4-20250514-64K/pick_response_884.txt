Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: places named after marine mammals that are associated with specific seasonal activities or phenomena.

The examples all follow the pattern: [Marine Mammal] [Geographic Feature], [Location] - [Season] [Activity/Phenomenon]

The anti-examples have marine animal names but critically lack the seasonal activity component, which is the key distinguishing feature of the specific theme.
