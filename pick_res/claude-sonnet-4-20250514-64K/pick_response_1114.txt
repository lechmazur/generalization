Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as structures or processes that branch or split from one into multiple parts.

Examples show branching/splitting:
- binary fission: one cell divides into two
- river delta: one river splits into multiple channels  
- decision tree: decisions branch into multiple options

Anti-examples are explicitly single/linear without branching:
- single-threaded process, single narrative storyline, single-threaded conversation
