Looking at the examples (Smokehouse, Hot smoker, Cold smoker) and anti-examples (Oven, Convection oven, Charcoal grill), I can identify that the specific theme is equipment designed primarily for smoking food. The anti-examples show that general cooking equipment and even grilling equipment that can produce smoke don't qualify for this specific theme.
