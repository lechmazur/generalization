Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify a theme around advanced, specialized technologies that enhance human perception by revealing or providing access to information that would otherwise be inaccessible to normal human senses.

The examples (VR headsets, GPS navigation systems, telescope) all use sophisticated technology to enhance perception for specific purposes - creating immersive virtual environments, providing precise location data, or revealing distant celestial objects.

The anti-examples are excluded because smartphones are general-purpose devices, satellites are infrastructure components rather than end-user systems, and binoculars are simple optical tools rather than advanced technology.
