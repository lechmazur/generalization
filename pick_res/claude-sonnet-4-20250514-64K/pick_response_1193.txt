Looking at the examples (jigsaw puzzle, wishbone, pi√±ata) and anti-examples (mosaic, collage, quilt), I can identify the specific theme: objects designed to be intentionally broken apart, broken open, or destroyed as part of their intended purpose or function. The anti-examples are all assembled from parts but not meant to be broken apart.
