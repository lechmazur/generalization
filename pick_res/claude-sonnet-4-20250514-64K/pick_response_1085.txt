Looking at the examples, I can identify a theme around concealment or hiding:
- cryptography conceals information through encoding
- camouflage clothing conceals appearance/identity  
- magic trick conceals methods/mechanisms

The anti-examples are about making things obvious or drawing attention:
- megaphone amplifies sound to make it obvious
- billboard displays information prominently
- fire alarm creates obvious warning signals
