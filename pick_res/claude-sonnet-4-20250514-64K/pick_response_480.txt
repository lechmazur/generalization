Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: Physical representations (statues/sculptures/figurines) of mythical creatures holding or interacting with miniature/small-scale sports equipment or game-related objects.

The anti-examples show mythical creatures participating in activities but lack the key elements of being physical objects and having miniature-scale equipment.
