Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific pattern that distinguishes them.

Examples: Rhone, Arno, Ebro
Anti-examples: Tiber, Garonne, Danube

After analyzing various geographical, linguistic, and cultural factors, the pattern appears to be rivers that are strongly associated with Renaissance or late medieval cultural flowering in their respective regions, rather than rivers of broader national significance or ancient fame.

- Rhone: Associated with medieval French culture and Renaissance period (Avignon Papacy, southeastern French culture)
- Arno: THE Renaissance river, flowing through Florence, the heart of the Italian Renaissance
- Ebro: Associated with the medieval/Renaissance Aragonese cultural period

The anti-examples don't fit:
- Tiber: More associated with ancient Rome than Renaissance
- Garonne: Medieval importance but not Renaissance-specific
- Danube: Medieval frontier significance, not Renaissance cultural center
