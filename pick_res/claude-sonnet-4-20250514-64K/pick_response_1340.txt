Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as products with protected geographical designations or indications of origin - items that can only be called by that name if they actually originate from that specific geographic location.

The examples (Darjeeling tea, Scotch whisky, Havana cigar) all have legal geographic protection, while the anti-examples (Swiss cheese, English breakfast tea, Belgian waffles) are generic terms for styles that can be produced anywhere.
