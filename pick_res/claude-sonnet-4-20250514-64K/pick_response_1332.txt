Looking at the examples, I need to identify the specific theme:
- Polaroid photograph: undergoes chemical development from unclear to clear image
- Tadpole: undergoes biological metamorphosis into a frog
- Ice cream mix: undergoes processing from liquid to frozen final product

The theme appears to be: developmental/irreversible transformation from an intermediate state to a mature/final form.

The anti-examples show related but different types of change:
- Seasonal tree: cyclical changes
- Water in kettle: reversible heating
- Mood ring: reactive color changes
