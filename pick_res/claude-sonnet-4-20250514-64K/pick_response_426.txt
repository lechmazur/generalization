Looking at the examples, I can identify the specific theme: Egyptian deities combined with quantum physics concepts. Each example features an Egyptian god/goddess (Bastet, Ra, Osiris) paired with a quantum physics concept (photon wave function, double-slit experiment, wave-particle duality).

The anti-examples show these quantum physics concepts in isolation, without the Egyptian deity component, demonstrating that just having the physics concept alone is insufficient.
