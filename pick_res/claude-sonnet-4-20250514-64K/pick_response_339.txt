Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify the specific theme that distinguishes them.

Examples use: gabbro, diorite, basalt (all igneous rocks) with "single piece/block" phrasing
Anti-examples use: marble, limestone, sandstone (non-igneous rocks) without "single piece/block" phrasing

The specific theme appears to be: Roman statues/figures carved from single pieces of igneous rock.
