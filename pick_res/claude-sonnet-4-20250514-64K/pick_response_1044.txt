Looking at the examples, I can identify a specific theme: cross-cultural mythological narratives about significant or unusual celestial events/phenomena, rather than just observational records of regular astronomical occurrences.

The examples feature:
- Phaethon's catastrophic celestial chaos (mythological narrative about dramatic celestial event)
- Flood narrative linked to celestial events (mythological story connected to celestial phenomena)  
- Sun standing still (narrative about abnormal celestial behavior)

The anti-examples are observational records of regular, predictable astronomical phenomena (eclipses, comets).
