Looking at the three examples, I can identify the specific theme as traditional handcrafted functional objects made from natural materials with decorative elements, often featuring living beings in motion.

The examples show:
- Natural materials (reed, leather, horsehair, bone)
- Traditional craftsmanship techniques (weaving, braiding, carving)
- Functional objects (basket, whip, flute)
- Decorative elements depicting motion or using materials from living beings

The anti-examples (steel mobile, copper windmill, paper kite) represent a broader theme of kinetic objects but lack the natural materials, traditional craftsmanship, and specific decorative elements of the specific theme.
