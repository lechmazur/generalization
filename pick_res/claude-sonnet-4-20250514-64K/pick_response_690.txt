Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify a specific theme around contributions to programming languages and compiler technology, as opposed to other areas of computer science.

Examples show figures known for:
- Grace Hopper: developed first compilers, COBOL language
- Frances Allen: compiler optimization theory  
- Barbara Liskov: programming language design, abstract data types

Anti-examples represent other important but different areas:
- Margaret Hamilton: systems programming, software engineering
- Betty Holberton: early programming, hardware-specific programming
