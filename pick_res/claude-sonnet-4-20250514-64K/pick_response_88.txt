Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes:

Examples: Limestone Cove, Sandstone Point, Granite City
Anti-examples: Basalt Ridge, Chalk Mountain, Shale Valley

The pattern appears to be rocks that are commonly used as dimension stone (building stone) versus those that are not typically used for construction purposes.

Examples: Limestone, Sandstone, and Granite are all major dimension stones used extensively in construction and architecture.

Anti-examples: Basalt (rarely used as dimension stone), Chalk (too soft), and Shale (too weak/layered) are not commonly used as dimension stone.
