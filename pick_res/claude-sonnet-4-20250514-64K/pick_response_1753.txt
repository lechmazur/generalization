Looking at the examples, I can identify a pattern of photosynthetic model organisms across different lineages:
- Arabidopsis thaliana (land plant model)
- Synechocystis (cyanobacterial model) 
- Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (green algae model)

The anti-examples are all well-established model organisms but are non-photosynthetic animals, representing a broader "model organism" theme.
