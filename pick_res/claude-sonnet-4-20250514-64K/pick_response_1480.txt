Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme as software focused on content creation, editing, and file manipulation, as opposed to software primarily designed for content consumption and playback.

Examples (content creation/manipulation):
- Adobe Photoshop: image editing and creation
- QuarkXPress: desktop publishing and layout creation  
- WinZip: file compression and archive creation

Anti-examples (content consumption):
- Windows Media Player: media playback
- iTunes: media playback and library management
- VLC Media Player: media playback
