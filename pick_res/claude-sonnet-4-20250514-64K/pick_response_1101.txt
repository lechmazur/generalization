Looking at the examples (bow and arrow, crane, suspension bridge) and anti-examples (spring, lever, pulley), I need to identify what distinguishes the specific theme from the broader mechanical devices category.

The examples all primarily operate through tension as their main mechanism:
- Bow and arrow: tension in bowstring stores and releases energy
- Crane: tension in cables bears loads
- Suspension bridge: tension in cables supports the structure

The anti-examples are mechanical devices but don't use tension as their primary mechanism - they use compression/extension (spring), fulcrum leverage (lever), and force redirection (pulley).
