Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I can identify the specific theme by analyzing the patterns:

Examples (Vodyanoy, Yamuna, Nyai Roro Kidul) are regional water spirits/deities from non-classical folk traditions, often associated with specific bodies of water.

Anti-examples (Charybdis, Scylla, Oceanus) are from classical Greek mythology and represent more cosmic/universal water entities.
