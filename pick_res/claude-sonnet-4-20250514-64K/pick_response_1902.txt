Looking at the examples and anti-examples, I need to identify what distinguishes the specific theme from the broader Pacific island tourism theme.

Examples: Bora Bora, Cook Islands, Fiji - These appear to be destinations known primarily for luxury/resort tourism rather than as administrative centers or nations with strong cultural/political identities beyond tourism.

Anti-examples: Tahiti (administrative center of French Polynesia), Samoa (independent nation with strong cultural identity), Tonga (traditional kingdom) - These have tourism but are primarily known for other roles or identities.
