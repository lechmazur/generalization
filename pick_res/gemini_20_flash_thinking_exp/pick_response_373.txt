The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples:
- glass engraving (manipulation of glass to create a design)
- sandcastle (manipulation of sand to create a structure)
- carved wooden figurine (manipulation of wood to create a form)

Anti-examples:
- carved ice sculpture (manipulation of ice) - broader theme: carving
- metal sculpture (sculpture made of metal) - broader theme: sculpture
- cast bronze statue (creation of a statue using casting) - broader theme: statue, casting

The specific theme seems to be the creation of an artistic or decorative object through a subtractive or formative process using a relatively fragile or easily manipulated material. The anti-examples highlight that the material (ice, metal, bronze) and the process (casting) are not part of the specific theme.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. a clay pot: Made from clay, which is easily manipulated. Formative process. Seems like a good match.
2. a blown glass ornament: Made from glass, manipulated by blowing. Similar to glass engraving but a different process. Still a good match.
3. a cast iron skillet: Made from iron using a casting process. The material and process align with the anti-examples.
4. a forged sword: Made from metal using a forging process. The material aligns with the anti-examples.
5. a laser-cut metal design: Made from metal. The material aligns with the anti-examples.
6. a molded concrete block: Made from concrete using a molding process. The material is less fragile than the examples.
7. a marble sculpture: Made from marble, often through carving. While carving is in the examples, marble is a harder material than wood or sand.
8. a ceramic vase: Made from clay, similar to a clay pot. Formative process. Seems like a good match.<number>1</number><score>7</score>
