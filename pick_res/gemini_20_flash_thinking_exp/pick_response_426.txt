The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples combine ancient Egyptian deities with concepts from quantum physics. The anti-examples focus solely on the quantum physics concepts. Therefore, the specific theme is the combination of ancient Egyptian mythology and quantum physics concepts.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it combines these two elements.

1. **Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment:** This is a quantum physics concept but lacks the Egyptian mythology element.
2. **Model of an atom with electron orbitals:** This is a quantum physics concept but lacks the Egyptian mythology element.
3. **Statue of Anubis holding a prism with light refracting:** This combines an Egyptian deity with a physics concept (refraction), which is related to the anti-example of a prism.
4. **Depiction of quantum entanglement:** This is a quantum physics concept but lacks the Egyptian mythology element.
5. **Model of a wave function collapse:** This is a quantum physics concept but lacks the Egyptian mythology element.
6. **Diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum:** This is a physics concept but lacks the Egyptian mythology element.
7. **Depiction of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:** This is a quantum physics concept but lacks the Egyptian mythology element.
8. **Diagram illustrating wave-particle duality:** This is a quantum physics concept, similar to one of the elements in the original examples, but lacks the Egyptian mythology element.

Based on this analysis, candidate 3 is the strongest match as it explicitly combines an Egyptian deity with a physics concept. The other candidates primarily focus on the quantum physics aspect without the Egyptian mythology.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
