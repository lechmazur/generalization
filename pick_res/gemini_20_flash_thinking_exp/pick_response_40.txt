The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples. The specific theme seems to be about the acceptance of religious beliefs as rational without needing evidential support, specifically referencing the concept of "properly basic beliefs" or Reformed Epistemology. The anti-examples highlight that the evaluation should *not* consider broader themes related to faith, religion, or the conflict between science and religion in general.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10, where 10 indicates a strong match to the specific theme and 0 indicates no match. The scoring should be granular and nuanced, avoiding polarization.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1:** Directly mentions "basic, non-inferential belief," which aligns strongly with the specific theme.
*   **Candidate 2:** Discusses the philosophy of religion generally, which is too broad and matches the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 3:** Focuses on conversion without addressing epistemological issues, aligning with the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 4:** Portrays religious beliefs without focusing on the rationality of belief without evidence, aligning with the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 5:** Explores belief in general, which is too broad and matches the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 6:** Uses traditional arguments for God's existence, which is the opposite of the specific theme.
*   **Candidate 7:** Focuses on the personal journey of faith without a specific epistemological framework, aligning with the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 8:** Discusses the role of faith in personal development without referencing Reformed Epistemology, aligning with the anti-examples.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
