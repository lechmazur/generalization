The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "abacus", "pyramid", and "sundial". These share characteristics of being ancient, human-made, and related to basic needs like calculation, monumental construction, and timekeeping. The anti-examples are "spaceship", "time machine", and "terraforming device". These are futuristic, technologically advanced, and represent concepts beyond basic human needs.

The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples. The scoring should be granular and use the full range of 0-10.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **a flying car**:  While it involves transportation, it's technologically advanced and doesn't fit the ancient/basic theme. Score: 2
2. **the wheel**:  This is a fundamental invention, ancient, and foundational. It aligns well with the theme. Score: 9
3. **a holographic assistant**: This is a futuristic technology, clearly in the realm of the anti-examples. Score: 1
4. **a nanobot**:  Highly advanced technology, definitely not part of the specific theme. Score: 0
5. **a hologram**:  Modern technology, doesn't fit the ancient/basic theme. Score: 1
6. **a robot**:  Advanced technology, not aligned with the specific theme. Score: 1
7. **a virtual reality headset**:  Modern technology, clearly outside the specific theme. Score: 0
8. **a jetpack**:  While not as futuristic as some, it's still a relatively modern invention and doesn't fit the ancient/basic theme. Score: 3<number>1</number><score>2</score>
