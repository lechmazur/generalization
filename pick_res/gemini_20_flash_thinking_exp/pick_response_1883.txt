The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

The examples (dreamcatcher, crystal wand, shaman's drum) suggest a theme of **objects used in spiritual practices, often with a focus on personal power, connection to spirits, or altered states of consciousness.**

The anti-examples (prayer wheel, ritual dagger, statue of a deity) represent broader themes like general religious practices, ritualistic objects, and objects of worship.

I need to score each candidate based on how closely it aligns with the specific theme (dreamcatcher, wand, drum) and how much it diverges towards the broader themes represented by the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for each candidate:

1. **a rosary:**  Strongly associated with prayer and religious devotion (broader theme). Less about personal power or altered states. Score: 2

2. **a holy water bottle:**  Related to religious rituals and blessings (broader theme). Not directly linked to personal spiritual power or altered states in the same way as the examples. Score: 3

3. **a Tibetan singing bowl:** Used in meditation and spiritual practices, often to induce altered states of consciousness. Closer to the shaman's drum in function. Score: 8

4. **a ceremonial mask:** Can be used in rituals and to represent spirits, similar to the shaman's drum and potentially linked to altered states. Less about personal power like the wand. Score: 7

5. **a cross:** Primarily a symbol of Christian faith and worship (broader theme). Not directly related to the specific theme of personal power or altered states in the same way. Score: 1

6. **a prayer flag:**  Related to prayer and spreading blessings (broader theme). Less about personal power or inducing altered states. Score: 3

7. **a sacred thread:** Can be used for protection or blessings in various spiritual traditions. Has some overlap with the idea of personal power or spiritual connection, but less direct than the examples. Score: 5

8. **a meditation gong:** Similar to the singing bowl, used to facilitate meditation and potentially altered states of consciousness. Closer to the shaman's drum. Score: 8<number>1</number><score>2</score>
