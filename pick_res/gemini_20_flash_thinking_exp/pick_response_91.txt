The user wants me to identify a specific theme present in "Battleship Potemkin", "The Holy Virgin Mary", and "Frisk", and absent in "The Last Temptation of Christ", "The Rite of Spring", and "Lolita".

The examples share a common thread of causing significant public controversy and outrage due to their perceived provocative or transgressive content.

The anti-examples, while potentially controversial in some ways, didn't generate the same level of widespread public outcry and accusations of blasphemy, obscenity, or moral corruption as the examples.

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme of causing significant public controversy and outrage due to their provocative content.

1. "Hair": Known for its nudity, drug use, and anti-war sentiment, it was definitely controversial.
2. "Ulysses":  Famously banned for obscenity.
3. "Piss Christ":  Caused significant outrage and accusations of blasphemy.
4. "A Clockwork Orange":  Generated controversy for its violence and themes.
5. "God Save the Queen":  Caused outrage for its perceived attack on the monarchy.
6. "The Exorcist":  Caused significant controversy and moral panic due to its religious themes and graphic content.
7. "Angels in America":  While dealing with controversial topics like AIDS and homosexuality, it didn't generate the same level of widespread public outrage as the initial examples.
8. "Fountain":  Caused a scandal in the art world due to its readymade nature and perceived lack of artistic merit.

Based on this, I can now assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>10</score>
<number>4</number><score>7</score>
