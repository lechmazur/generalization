The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples highlight tools for measurement that are:
- Made of natural materials (bone, cord, wood)
- Relatively simple in construction
- Used for linear or dimensional measurement (length, distance, small distances)

The anti-examples highlight tools for measurement that are:
- Made of modern materials (plastic, metal, digital components)
- More complex in construction
- Can measure linear dimensions but are more general purpose.

The task is to evaluate candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not the broader theme of "measuring tools".

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **A graduated cylinder:** Measures volume, not linear dimensions. Material is usually glass or plastic (modern). Doesn't fit the specific theme.
2. **A balance scale:** Measures mass, not linear dimensions. Can be made of various materials, but the function is the key mismatch.
3. **A laser distance meter:** Measures distance, but uses modern technology. Doesn't fit the material or simplicity aspects.
4. **A measuring tape:** Measures linear dimensions. Can be made of fabric, metal, or fiberglass. The material is a key differentiator from the examples.
5. **A graduated bamboo tube for measuring volume:** Measures volume, not linear dimensions. However, the material (bamboo) aligns with the examples.
6. **A beaker:** Measures volume, not linear dimensions. Usually glass (modern material).
7. **A thermometer:** Measures temperature, not linear dimensions.
8. **A wooden yardstick:** Measures linear dimensions and is made of wood. This is the closest match among the candidates.
