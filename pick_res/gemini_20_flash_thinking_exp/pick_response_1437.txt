The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples (aurora borealis, deep-sea jellyfish glow, firefly bioluminescence) all involve light produced by natural processes, specifically chemiluminescence or similar phenomena in nature.

The anti-examples (incandescent light bulb, fluorescent light, halogen lamp) are all artificial light sources produced by heating a filament or exciting a gas with electricity.

Therefore, the specific theme is **natural light produced by chemical or biological processes**.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

1. **plasma globe**:  Uses electricity to excite gas, not a natural chemical/biological process. Likely a low score.
2. **neon sign**: Similar to plasma globe, uses electricity to excite neon gas. Low score.
3. **gas stove flame**:  Combustion of gas, a chemical reaction, but not a natural biological process. Could be a mid-range score.
4. **LED light**:  Artificial light source using semiconductors. Low score.
5. **glowworm light**: Bioluminescence, fits the theme perfectly. High score.
6. **candle flame**: Combustion of wax, a chemical reaction, but not a natural biological process. Similar to gas stove flame. Mid-range score.
7. **campfire**: Combustion of wood, a chemical reaction, but not a natural biological process. Similar to gas stove flame and candle flame. Mid-range score.
8. **street lamp**: Artificial light source, likely electric. Low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
