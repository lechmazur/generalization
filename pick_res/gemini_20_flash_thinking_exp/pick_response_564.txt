The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "sea cucumber", "banana slug", and "Spanish slug". The anti-examples are "snail", "garden snail", and "octopus". The task is to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples suggest the theme is likely "soft-bodied invertebrates without a shell". The anti-examples are misleading because they include shelled invertebrates (snails) and a cephalopod (octopus), which are also invertebrates but don't fit the specific theme.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **earthworm**: Soft-bodied, segmented, invertebrate. Fits the specific theme well.
2. **bombardier beetle**:  Insect, has an exoskeleton. Does not fit the specific theme.
3. **salamander**: Vertebrate, amphibian. Does not fit the specific theme.
4. **hagfish**:  Jawless fish, but soft-bodied and somewhat slug-like in appearance. Closer to the theme than some others.
5. **jellyfish**: Soft-bodied invertebrate, but radially symmetrical and gelatinous. Shares some characteristics but distinct.
6. **millipede**:  Arthropod, segmented body with many legs, has an exoskeleton. Does not fit the specific theme.
7. **leech**:  Segmented worm, soft-bodied, invertebrate. Fits the specific theme well.
8. **skunk**: Mammal, vertebrate. Does not fit the specific theme.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range:

1. earthworm: High score, as it fits the criteria well.
2. bombardier beetle: Low score, as it's an insect with an exoskeleton.
3. salamander: Very low score, as it's a vertebrate.
4. hagfish: Moderate score, as it's soft-bodied but a fish.
5. jellyfish: Moderate score, as it's soft-bodied but has a different body plan.
6. millipede: Low score, as it has an exoskeleton.
7. leech: High score, as it fits the criteria well.
8. skunk: Very low score, as it's a mammal.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
