The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Walrus skin boat ceremony (Chukchi)
- Seal hunting rituals (Yupik)
- Narwhal tusk ceremonial exchange (Inuvialuit)

Anti-examples:
- Reindeer rituals (Sami)
- Salmon ceremonies (Pacific Northwest)
- Buffalo ceremonies (Great Plains)

The specific theme seems to be **ceremonial practices involving marine mammals by Arctic/Subarctic indigenous peoples.**

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes of animal use in rituals or general cultural practices.

Candidate evaluation:
1. Eagle feathers (Plains Indians):  Not marine mammals, not Arctic/Subarctic. Low score.
2. Bear claws (Native American): Not marine mammals, could be Arctic/Subarctic but not necessarily. Low to mid score.
3. Polynesian fishing techniques: Not marine mammals, different geographical region. Low score.
4. Animal costumes in dances: Too general, not specific to marine mammals or Arctic/Subarctic. Low score.
5. Feathers in Native American rituals: Too general, not specific to marine mammals or Arctic/Subarctic. Low score.
6. Coastal fishing festivals: Not necessarily involving marine mammals or Arctic/Subarctic. Low to mid score.
7. Animal symbols in totem poles (Pacific Northwest): Could involve marine mammals, but the focus is on symbolism, not direct ceremonial use. Mid score.
8. Whale bones in Inuit ceremonial dances:  Involves marine mammals and the Inuit (Arctic). High score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
