The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on three examples and three anti-examples.

The core elements of the theme seem to be:
- A group of individuals with specific abilities or roles.
- A mystery or threat that needs to be resolved.
- A strict time limit or deadline.
- A significant consequence for failure, often affecting a larger group or the world.

The anti-examples lack the mystery/investigation element and focus on preventing a known, large-scale disaster.

Let's evaluate each candidate based on these criteria:

Candidate 1: Hackers stopping a cyberattack. Has a group, a threat, and a consequence. Less of a mystery, more of a prevention. Time limit is implied.

Candidate 2: Enchanted beings solving a stolen artifact mystery. Has a group, a mystery, a time limit (lunar cycle), and a consequence. Strong match.

Candidate 3: Friends finding lost treasure. Has a group and a goal. Lacks a strict time limit and a significant consequence for failure.

Candidate 4: Adventurers finding a legendary artifact. Similar to candidate 3, lacks a strict time limit and significant consequence.

Candidate 5: Agents stopping a terrorist attack. Has a group, a threat, and an implied time limit. Less of a mystery, more of a prevention.

Candidate 6: Explorers reaching a summit before a storm. Has a group, a goal, and a time limit. Lacks the mystery/investigation element and the consequence is more personal.

Candidate 7: Archaeologists uncovering an ancient secret before a disaster. Has a group, a mystery, and a time limit. Good match.

Candidate 8: Survivors finding shelter before nuclear winter. Has a group, a goal, and a time limit. Lacks the mystery/investigation element.

Now, let's assign scores based on the strength of the match, ensuring granularity.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>3</score>
<number>5</number><score>5</score>
<number>6</number><score>4</score>
<number>7</number><score>7</score>
<number>8</number><score>3</score>
