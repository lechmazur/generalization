The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme defined by the examples, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core elements of the specific theme are:
- **Vintage:**  The examples mention "Vintage", "Early 20th-century", and "1930s".
- **Woven material (specifically wicker):**  The examples use "woven hamper" and "wicker basket/set".
- **Picnic-related:** The examples are all related to picnics or outdoor gatherings.
- **Dedicated compartments for specific beverage types:**  The examples mention "wine bottles", "champagne", and "soda bottles".

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:
- **Not contemporary:**  "Contemporary wicker hamper" is an anti-example.
- **Not just for food:** "Wooden picnic box with utensils but no beverage storage" is an anti-example.
- **Not made of plastic:** "Plastic picnic basket" is an anti-example.
- **Not without specific beverage compartments:** "Contemporary wicker hamper without specific beverage compartments" is an anti-example.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against these criteria, assigning a score from 0 to 10.
