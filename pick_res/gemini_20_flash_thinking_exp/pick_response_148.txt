The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

The examples (spider web, circus trapeze rigging, rock climbing harness) all involve interconnected strands or ropes designed to hold weight or provide support, often with a degree of flexibility or tension.

The anti-examples (stone column, granite pillar, concrete pier) are all solid, vertical structures designed for support, but lack the interconnected strand/rope characteristic.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be about *interconnected flexible strands or ropes used for support or holding*.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Load-bearing wall:**  While it provides support, it's a solid structure, not interconnected strands. Lower score.
2. **Roman arch:**  Relies on the interlocking of stones, not flexible strands. Lower score.
3. **Concrete dam:** A massive solid structure. Very low score.
4. **Stone abutment:** Similar to the anti-examples, a solid support structure. Low score.
5. **Wooden post:** A single solid support element. Low score.
6. **Golden Gate Bridge cables:**  Fits the theme perfectly - interconnected strands of metal providing support. High score.
7. **Concrete pillar:**  An anti-example. Very low score.
8. **Brick wall:** A solid structure made of multiple units, but not interconnected flexible strands. Lower score.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores using the full range, avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
