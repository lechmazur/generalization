The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme defined by the examples, while explicitly avoiding matching the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The specific theme seems to be about visual patterns used for recording information or expressing concepts, with a strong emphasis on the visual and structural aspects of the patterns themselves. The examples highlight:
- Visual patterns (beadwork, knots)
- Used for recording information (numerical data in quipu) or expressing concepts (infinity in Celtic knots)
- Structural properties (symmetry groups, interconnectedness)

The anti-examples highlight broader themes that should be avoided:
- General geometric patterns (Islamic)
- Mathematical principles in design (African fractal architecture)
- Information recording through spatial means (Polynesian navigation charts)

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme of visual patterns for information/concept representation with a focus on the pattern's structure, while avoiding simply being a method of recording information or a general geometric concept.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Mesopotamian clay tablets:** While they contain information, the focus isn't on visual patterns in the same way as the examples. The writing system is more symbolic than patterned in the sense of the examples. Likely a low score.
2. **African sand drawings from Angola demonstrating graph theory principles:** This has a visual pattern aspect and demonstrates mathematical principles, which is closer to the theme than just text. However, the focus on graph theory might lean towards the broader theme suggested by the anti-examples. Mid-range score.
3. **Mayan calendar calculations:** This is about a system of calculation, not necessarily a visual pattern. While the calendar might have visual representations, the core is the calculation method. Low score.
4. **Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic numerals:** These are visual symbols for numbers, but the emphasis is on the symbolic representation of numbers rather than complex visual patterns like the examples. Mid-low score.
5. **Babylonian base-60 number system:** This is a mathematical system, not a visual pattern. Low score.
6. **Chinese magic squares:** These are visual arrangements of numbers with specific mathematical properties. This has a strong visual pattern aspect and encodes information. High score.
7. **Aztec codex calculations:** Similar to Mayan calendar calculations, the focus is on the calculation method, although codices have visual elements. Mid-low score.
8. **Chinese counting rods:** These are physical objects used for calculation, not inherently visual patterns in the same way as the examples. Low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
