The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are Quark star, Neutron star, and Magnetar. These are all types of compact stellar remnants. The anti-examples are Singularity, Event horizon, and Gravitational wave. These are related to gravity and black holes but are not physical objects in the same way as the examples.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme identified by the examples, while explicitly excluding broader related themes hinted at by the anti-examples.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **Black hole:**  A black hole is a compact stellar remnant, similar to the examples. However, the anti-examples include singularity and event horizon, which are directly related to black holes. It's a close call, but the core theme seems to be about specific types of dense stellar objects.

2. **Gravitational lensing:** This is a phenomenon caused by gravity, similar to gravitational waves. It's not a physical object.

3. **Dark matter:** This is a hypothetical form of matter, but not a compact stellar remnant in the same vein as the examples.

4. **Pulsar:** A pulsar is a type of neutron star, which is one of the examples.

5. **Wormhole (hypothetical):** This is a theoretical topological feature of spacetime, not a stellar object.

6. **Quasar:** A quasar is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus, powered by a supermassive black hole. While it involves a black hole, it's a broader phenomenon than the specific examples.

7. **Accretion disk:** This is a structure formed by diffuse material orbiting a central body, like a black hole or neutron star. It's related to the examples but not a stellar remnant itself.

8. **Cosmic string (hypothetical):** This is a theoretical topological defect in spacetime, not a stellar object.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
