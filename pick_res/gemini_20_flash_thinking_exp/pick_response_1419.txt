The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme of dance. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate the candidate dances based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

Looking at the examples:
- Muchongoyo (Zimbabwe): A vigorous, energetic dance traditionally performed by men, often involving stomping and rhythmic movements.
- Kpanlogo (Ghana): A social dance involving intricate hand and foot movements, often performed in a circle.
- Gumboot dance (South Africa): A dance performed by workers wearing Wellington boots, using the boots to create rhythmic sounds through stomping, slapping, and clicking.

Looking at the anti-examples:
- Atilogwu (Igbo): A fast-paced, acrobatic dance involving complex body movements.
- Clogging: A folk dance characterized by the sounds of hard-soled shoes striking the floor rhythmically.
- Tap dance: A dance form characterized by using the sounds of tap shoes striking the floor as a form of percussion.

The specific theme seems to be **African dances that involve percussive footwork and rhythmic stamping/stomping as a primary element, often performed by a group.** The anti-examples, while also rhythmic, emphasize different aspects (acrobatics, specific shoe types for sound).

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. Irish stepdance: Focuses on intricate footwork and stationary upper body. While rhythmic, it's not the same kind of grounded, percussive stamping as the examples.
2. Moribayasa (Mali): A dance of celebration and storytelling, often involving flowing movements and gestures. While rhythmic, the emphasis might not be on percussive footwork in the same way.
3. Eskista (Ethiopia): Characterized by energetic shoulder movements and chest thrusts. Footwork is present but not the primary focus.
4. Adowa (Ashanti): A social dance with graceful hand gestures and subtle foot movements. Not primarily focused on percussive stamping.
5. Flamenco: Emphasizes intricate footwork (zapateado) and hand movements. While the footwork is percussive, the cultural context and style differ significantly.
6. Agbadza (Ewe): A social dance with swaying movements and rhythmic steps. While there is footwork, it's not the same forceful stamping.
7. Sabar (Senegal): Known for its fast-paced drumming and energetic movements, often involving leaps and intricate footwork. Likely closer to the theme.
8. Indlamu (Zulu): A traditional war dance characterized by high kicks and stamping of the feet. This seems to fit the theme well.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
