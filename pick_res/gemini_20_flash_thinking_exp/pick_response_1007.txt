The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: Wheel, Penicillin, Printing Press
Anti-examples: Transistor, Light Bulb, Steam Engine

The examples seem to represent fundamental, transformative inventions or discoveries that had a profound impact on society. They are not necessarily electronic or powered by electricity. They are also not primarily about communication or information processing in the modern sense.

The anti-examples seem to represent later technological advancements, often involving electricity or more complex systems.

Specific theme:  Fundamental, transformative inventions/discoveries that predate the widespread use of electricity and modern electronics. They represent breakthroughs that significantly altered human life and society.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. The GPS: Relies on satellites and complex electronics. Doesn't fit the specific theme.
2. The computer:  A product of modern electronics. Doesn't fit the specific theme.
3. The pacemaker:  A medical device relying on electronics. Doesn't fit the specific theme.
4. The laser:  A modern invention based on quantum mechanics. Doesn't fit the specific theme.
5. The telephone:  Relies on electrical signals for communication. Closer than some, but still doesn't fit the core of the theme.
6. The radio:  Relies on electromagnetic waves and electronics. Doesn't fit the specific theme.
7. The internet:  A network of computers and electronic devices. Doesn't fit the specific theme.
8. The combustion engine:  A mechanical invention, but more complex than the wheel and developed later than penicillin or the printing press. Closer than the electronic devices, but not a perfect fit.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
