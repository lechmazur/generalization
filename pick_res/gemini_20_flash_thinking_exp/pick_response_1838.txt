The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are all peace agreements related to ending violent conflicts. The anti-examples are also peace treaties, but they are specifically related to the aftermath of World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "peace agreements ending violent conflicts, particularly those involving internal or regional conflicts rather than major global wars". The anti-examples are peace treaties following a major global war.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of "peace treaties".

1. **The Treaty of Paris (1783):** Ended the American Revolutionary War. This fits the specific theme.
2. **The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine:** Part of the post-WWI treaties, like the anti-examples.
3. **The Treaty of Riga:** Ended the Polish-Soviet War. This fits the specific theme.
4. **The Congress of Vienna:**  Aimed to reshape Europe after the Napoleonic Wars, more about establishing a new order than ending a specific conflict in the same way as the examples.
5. **The Camp David Accords:**  Peace treaty between Israel and Egypt. This fits the specific theme.
6. **The Treaty of San Francisco:**  Peace treaty with Japan after WWII, similar to the anti-examples.
7. **The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk:**  Ended Russia's involvement in WWI, similar to the anti-examples.
8. **The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye:** Part of the post-WWI treaties, like the anti-examples.

Now, I need to assign scores from 0 to 10, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.

- Candidates similar to the examples should get higher scores.
- Candidates similar to the anti-examples should get lower scores.
- Candidates that are somewhat related but not a perfect fit should get mid-range scores.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
<number>2</number><score>2</score>
<number>3</number><score>7</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>
<number>5</number><score>9</score>
<number>6</number><score>3</score>
<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>2</score>
