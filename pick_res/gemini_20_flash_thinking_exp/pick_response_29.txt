The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are all mesh wifi systems. The anti-examples are all smart home hubs that are not primarily focused on providing wifi. Therefore, the specific theme is likely "mesh wifi router". I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the "mesh wifi router" category, avoiding the broader category of "smart home device".

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:
1. Amazon eero Pro 6E router: This is a mesh wifi router. Good match.
2. Nest Learning Thermostat: This is a smart thermostat, not a router. Poor match.
3. Arlo Pro 3 Camera: This is a security camera, not a router. Poor match.
4. Sonos One Speaker: This is a smart speaker, not a router. Poor match.
5. Belkin WeMo Switch: This is a smart plug, not a router. Poor match.
6. Echo Dot: This is a smart speaker/assistant, not a router. Poor match.
7. Logitech Harmony Hub: This is a universal remote hub, not a router. Poor match.
8. Ecobee SmartThermostat: This is a smart thermostat, not a router. Poor match.

Now I need to assign scores from 0 to 10, ensuring granularity.

1. Amazon eero Pro 6E router:  Clearly a mesh wifi router, so a high score. Let's say 9.
2. Nest Learning Thermostat:  Definitely not a router. Score 1.
3. Arlo Pro 3 Camera:  Not a router. Score 0.
4. Sonos One Speaker: Not a router. Score 0.
5. Belkin WeMo Switch: Not a router. Score 0.
6. Echo Dot: Not a router. Score 0.
7. Logitech Harmony Hub: Not a router. Score 0.
8. Ecobee SmartThermostat: Not a router. Score 1.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
