The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are 'a pencil', 'a whiteboard marker', and 'a soft eraser'. These are all tools for writing or erasing on a surface. The anti-examples are 'a whistle', 'a drum', and 'a loudspeaker'. These are all tools for making sounds. The task is to evaluate how well the candidates match the specific theme, which seems to be related to writing/drawing tools, and explicitly *not* the broader theme of sound-making tools.

Let's evaluate each candidate:
1. **a book**: A book is related to writing, as it contains written text. However, it's not a tool *for* writing. It's a recipient of writing. It's closer to the theme than the sound-making anti-examples, but not a direct match.
2. **a megaphone**: A megaphone is a tool for amplifying sound, directly related to the anti-examples.
3. **a gunshot**: A gunshot produces a loud sound, directly related to the anti-examples.
4. **a fire alarm**: A fire alarm produces a loud sound to alert people, directly related to the anti-examples.
5. **a car horn**: A car horn produces a sound for signaling, directly related to the anti-examples.
6. **a jackhammer**: A jackhammer is a tool that makes a loud noise while breaking materials. The primary function isn't sound production for communication, but sound is a byproduct. Still closer to the anti-examples.
7. **a vacuum cleaner**: A vacuum cleaner makes a loud noise while cleaning. The primary function isn't sound production. Still closer to the anti-examples.
8. **a siren**: A siren produces a loud, attention-grabbing sound, directly related to the anti-examples.

Based on this analysis, the scores should reflect the proximity to the writing/drawing tool theme and the distance from the sound-making theme.

- Book is somewhat related to writing.
- The rest are clearly related to sound production.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
