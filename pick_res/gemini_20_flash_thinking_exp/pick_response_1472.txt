The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are all objects that are rotated or spun as part of a ritual or spiritual practice. The anti-examples are static objects used in rituals. Therefore, the specific theme is likely "ritual objects that are rotated or spun".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of "ritual objects".

1. **a ritual dagger**:  Not typically rotated. Low score.
2. **a rosary bead**:  Beads are moved, but not necessarily rotated in the same way as the examples. Moderate score.
3. **a rotating amulet in ancient Egyptian ceremonies**: Explicitly mentions rotation. High score.
4. **a ceremonial gong**:  Struck, not rotated. Low score.
5. **a ritual offering bowl**: Static object. Low score.
6. **a sacred chalice**: Static object. Low score.
7. **a ceremonial robe**: Worn, not rotated. Low score.
8. **a sacred relic**: Static object. Low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
