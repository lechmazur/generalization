The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: submarine ballast tank, water tower, dam
Anti-examples: reservoir, water wheel, canal

The examples all involve structures that *hold* or *contain* a significant amount of water for a specific purpose, often involving controlled release or manipulation of that water.

The anti-examples, while related to water, don't fit the same specific purpose of containment for later use or controlled release. A reservoir is a large natural or artificial lake used for storage, but it's not a constructed tank or barrier in the same way. A water wheel uses the flow of water for power, not containment. A canal is a channel for water transport, not storage.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be about structures designed to *contain* a volume of water for a specific, often engineered, purpose.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **a waterfall:** Water flowing naturally. Doesn't involve containment.
2. **a rain barrel:**  Designed to collect and hold rainwater. Fits the theme.
3. **a hydraulic press:** Uses pressurized fluid (often water) to generate force. The water is contained within the system for this purpose. Fits the theme.
4. **a storm drain:** Designed to *remove* water, not contain it for later use.
5. **a sprinkler system:**  Designed to *distribute* water, not primarily to contain it.
6. **a water pipe:** Designed to *transport* water, not contain it in a significant volume.
7. **a river:** A natural flowing body of water. Not a constructed containment structure.
8. **a water pump:** Designed to *move* water, not contain it.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
