The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

The examples are:
- green jade prayer beads
- red ochre powder bowl
- white sage smudge bundle

These items seem to be related to spiritual or ritual practices and are made of natural materials.

The anti-examples are:
- brass bell
- bronze ritual vessel
- metal singing bowl

These items are also related to spiritual or ritual practices but are made of metal. This suggests the specific theme is related to spiritual/ritual items made of *non-metallic* natural materials.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. steel ritual sword - Metal, so not a good match.
2. gold offering plate - Metal, so not a good match.
3. silver chalice - Metal, so not a good match.
4. wooden cross - Non-metallic natural material, related to spiritual practice. Good match.
5. clay ritual pot - Non-metallic natural material, related to ritual practice. Good match.
6. copper meditation bowl - Metal, so not a good match.
7. black obsidian ceremonial knife - Non-metallic natural material, related to ceremonial practice. Good match.
8. ceramic incense holder - Non-metallic material, related to ritual practice. Good match.

Now I need to assign scores from 0 to 10, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.

1. steel ritual sword - Clearly doesn't fit the specific theme (metal). Score: 1
2. gold offering plate - Clearly doesn't fit the specific theme (metal). Score: 1
3. silver chalice - Clearly doesn't fit the specific theme (metal). Score: 1
4. wooden cross - Fits the specific theme (non-metallic natural material, spiritual). Score: 9
5. clay ritual pot - Fits the specific theme (non-metallic natural material, ritual). Score: 9
6. copper meditation bowl - Clearly doesn't fit the specific theme (metal). Score: 1
7. black obsidian ceremonial knife - Fits the specific theme (non-metallic natural material, ceremonial). Score: 8 (Obsidian is less obviously 'natural' than wood or clay).
8. ceramic incense holder - Fits the specific theme (non-metallic material, ritual). Score: 8 (Ceramic is processed, less purely 'natural').<number>1</number><score>1</score>
