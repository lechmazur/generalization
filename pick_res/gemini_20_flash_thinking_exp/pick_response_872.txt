The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are Chess with a random move generator, Fantasy sports drafting, and Poker. The anti-examples are Bridge, Slot machines, and Lottery.

Looking at the examples, they all involve:
- **Strategic decision-making:** Players make choices that influence the outcome.
- **Element of chance/randomness:**  This is explicit in "Chess with a random move generator" and present in the dealing of cards in Poker and the unpredictable performance of athletes in Fantasy sports.
- **Competition against other players (directly or indirectly):** Chess and Poker are direct competition. Fantasy sports involves competing against others based on the performance of selected players.

The anti-examples, while having elements of chance, lack the same level of strategic decision-making and direct competition in the same way. Bridge has strategy but less explicit randomness in the core mechanics (though card distribution is random). Slot machines and Lottery are primarily games of chance with minimal strategic input.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **games involving strategic decision-making with an element of chance and competition against other players.**

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes that the anti-examples might suggest (like games of chance in general).

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

1. **Backgammon:**  Involves strategic movement of pieces and the roll of dice (chance). It's also a direct competition between two players. High score.
2. **Stock market investing:**  Involves strategic decisions based on market analysis, but the "chance" element is more about unpredictable market forces than a defined game mechanic. Competition is indirect. Moderate score.
3. **Jeopardy:** Primarily a game of knowledge and recall. While there's a strategic element in wagering, the core mechanic doesn't strongly align with the theme. Lower score.
4. **Roulette:**  Almost purely a game of chance with minimal strategic input. Low score.
5. **Scrabble:**  Involves strategic placement of tiles and word choice, but the element of chance is primarily in the tile draw. Direct competition. Moderate to high score.
6. **Baseball:**  Involves strategic decisions by managers and players, but the element of chance is more about the unpredictable nature of athletic performance. Competition is between teams. Moderate score.
7. **Go:**  A game of pure strategy with no explicit element of chance. Direct competition. Low score.
8. **Chess:**  A game of pure strategy, but the example "Chess with a random move generator" explicitly includes chance. High score.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
