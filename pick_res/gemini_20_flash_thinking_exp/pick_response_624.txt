The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest:
- Natural mineral/crystal
- Hollowed out or with a natural cavity
- Used as a container for burning/holding aromatics

Anti-examples suggest what the theme is NOT:
- Not just any candle holder (glass)
- Not just any crystal (amethyst geode)
- Not just any incense burner (ceramic)

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **natural mineral/crystal formations specifically adapted (either naturally or by carving) to hold aromatics for burning.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes.

Candidate 1: Himalayan salt lamp. It's a natural mineral, but not necessarily used for holding aromatics. It emits light and potentially ions. Broader theme: items made of natural materials.

Candidate 2: Scented candle. It holds aromatics, but it's not a natural mineral formation. Broader theme: items that release fragrance.

Candidate 3: Quartz point. It's a natural mineral, but not designed to hold aromatics. Broader theme: natural crystals.

Candidate 4: Wooden smudge stick holder. It holds aromatics, but it's not a natural mineral. Broader theme: items for burning aromatics.

Candidate 5: Calcite crystal. It's a natural mineral, but not necessarily used for holding aromatics. Broader theme: natural crystals.

Candidate 6: Selenite wand. It's a natural mineral, but not designed to hold aromatics. Broader theme: natural crystals.

Candidate 7: Himalayan salt lamp carved into a bowl shape, designed to hold incense cones. This fits the specific theme well - natural mineral adapted to hold aromatics.

Candidate 8: Metal oil diffuser. It holds aromatics, but it's not a natural mineral. Broader theme: items for diffusing fragrance.

Now I will assign scores based on how well each candidate matches the specific theme.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>
<number>5</number><score>5</score>
<number>6</number><score>4</score>
<number>7</number><score>9</score>
<number>8</number><score>2</score>
