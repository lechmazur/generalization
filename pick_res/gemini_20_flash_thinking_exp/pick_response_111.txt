The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: ballet performance, high-speed printing press, mechanical watch
Anti-examples: synchronized swimmers, synchronized clocks, fleet of drones

The examples share the characteristic of intricate, coordinated movement or operation of individual parts to achieve a specific function or aesthetic outcome. The anti-examples involve synchronization of multiple independent entities. The specific theme seems to be about a single, complex entity with internal coordination, not multiple entities acting in unison.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **a series of interconnected gears:** This strongly aligns with the internal mechanical complexity of the examples.
2. **a collection of satellites:** This leans towards the "multiple synchronized entities" aspect of the anti-examples.
3. **a network of computers:** Similar to satellites, this involves multiple independent entities working together.
4. **a phased array radar system:** This involves coordinated action of multiple elements, but within a single system for a specific purpose, making it closer to the examples.
5. **a set of traffic lights:**  While there's a sequence, it lacks the intricate internal coordination of the examples. It's more about external timing.
6. **a musical ensemble:** This is similar to the synchronized swimmers - multiple individuals coordinating.
7. **a group of dancers:**  Again, multiple individuals coordinating, like the synchronized swimmers.
8. **a conveyor belt system:** This has internal movement and coordination to achieve a function, similar to the printing press.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
