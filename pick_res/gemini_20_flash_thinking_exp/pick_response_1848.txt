The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme defined by the examples, and explicitly *not* the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The specific theme seems to be software solutions for *local retail businesses*. Key elements are:
- **Software solution:**  All examples are software.
- **For retail businesses:**  All examples are for businesses selling goods directly to consumers.
- **Local/Small to Medium sized:** The examples mention "local retail businesses", "small grocery shops", and "medium-sized retail outlets". This suggests a focus on smaller scale operations.

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:
- **Not for e-commerce only:** Marketing automation for e-commerce.
- **Not for service-based businesses:** Restaurant management.
- **Not for individual use:** Accounting software for freelancers.
- **Not necessarily large-scale enterprises:**  The examples are more focused on smaller businesses.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, using a scale of 0 to 10.

Candidate 1: Event management software for conference organizers -  Not retail, not local. Score: Low.
Candidate 2: Human resources management system for multinational companies - Not retail, not local. Score: Very low.
Candidate 3: Project management tool for software development teams - Not retail. Score: Very low.
Candidate 4: Inventory management software tailored for boutique stores -  Retail, and "boutique stores" fits the local/small scale. Score: High.
Candidate 5: Enterprise resource planning system for large corporations -  Could be used by retail, but "large corporations" goes against the local/small scale. Score: Medium-low.
Candidate 6: Supply chain management platform for manufacturing industries - Not retail. Score: Very low.
Candidate 7: Social media management tool for influencers - Not retail. Score: Very low.
Candidate 8: Cloud storage service for personal use - Not for businesses. Score: Very low.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
