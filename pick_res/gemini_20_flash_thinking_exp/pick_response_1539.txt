The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by the provided examples and differentiated from the anti-examples.

The core elements of the theme are:
- **Balancing opposing traits/concepts:**  Personality types, interior design principles, management theories.
- **Lack of objective metrics:** No verifiable way to measure the balanced elements (personality dimensions, chi, innovation/stability).
- **Archetypal or philosophical basis:**  Four temperaments, Feng Shui principles, management theories.

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:
- **Interdependent but not necessarily balanced:** Yin and Yang (can exist in varying proportions).
- **Measurable and quantifiable:** Supply and demand (economic data).
- **Practical and achievable:** Work-life balance (a goal, not a system with inherent unmeasurable elements).

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against these criteria.

1. **The justice system:**  Aims for fairness, but has objective metrics (laws, evidence). Doesn't fit the lack of objective metrics.
2. **Checks and balances in government:**  A system of opposing powers, but with defined roles and processes. More about preventing imbalance than achieving a specific, unmeasurable balance.
3. **A thermostat regulating temperature:**  Objective measurement and a clear goal. Not about balancing opposing, unmeasurable forces.
4. **Ecosystems in nature:**  Complex interactions, but with measurable factors (population, resources). While there's a concept of balance, it's not based on unmeasurable forces.
5. **Certain alternative medicine practices:**  Claims to balance unmeasurable "humors" or "energies." This strongly aligns with the theme.
6. **A balanced diet:**  Measurable nutrients and health outcomes. Doesn't fit the lack of objective metrics.
7. **Balancing a budget:**  Quantifiable income and expenses. Objective metrics are central.
8. **Negotiating a compromise:**  A process of finding agreement, not necessarily about balancing inherent, unmeasurable opposing forces.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
