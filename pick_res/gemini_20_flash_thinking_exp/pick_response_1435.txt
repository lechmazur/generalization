The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme from the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples all involve a single individual confronting a physical barrier or established authority in a highly symbolic act of defiance against segregation or oppression.

The anti-examples, while related to social change and protest, involve group actions, legal challenges, or revolutionary events.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **A single individual's defiant act of confronting a physical barrier or established authority in a symbolic challenge against segregation or oppression.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Gandhi's Salt March:** While a significant act of defiance, it involved a large group of people, not a single individual. It also wasn't about confronting a specific physical barrier in the same way.
2. **The Montgomery Bus Boycott:** This was a collective action, not a single individual's act.
3. **The Stonewall Riots:** This was a spontaneous group uprising.
4. **Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, 1955:** This fits the theme very well - a single individual defying established segregation on public transport.
5. **Women's Suffrage Parade of 1913:** This was a group demonstration.
6. **The Fall of the Berlin Wall:** This was a large-scale event involving many people and the dismantling of a physical barrier by crowds.
7. **The Boston Tea Party:** This was a group action involving the destruction of property.
8. **The Selma to Montgomery March:** This was a large-scale protest march.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
