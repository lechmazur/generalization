The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
- Boyle's Law of Gas Pressure and Volume
- Huygens' Principle of Wavefronts

Anti-examples:
- Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
- Bohr's Model of the Atom
- Schrodinger's Wave Equation

The examples seem to be classical physics laws or principles describing macroscopic phenomena. The anti-examples are related to quantum mechanics and atomic structure.

The specific theme seems to be "Classical Physics Laws/Principles describing macroscopic phenomena".

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of general physics principles.

Candidate Evaluation:
1. Ohm's Law of Electrical Resistance: Classical physics, macroscopic phenomenon. Good match.
2. Avogadro's Law of Gas Volumes: Classical physics, macroscopic phenomenon. Good match.
3. Maxwell's Equations of Electromagnetism: Classical physics, macroscopic phenomenon. Good match.
4. Hooke's Law of Elasticity: Classical physics, macroscopic phenomenon. Good match.
5. Planck's Law of Black Body Radiation:  A bridge to quantum mechanics, but can be considered within classical thermodynamics. Less of a direct fit than the others.
6. Newton's Laws of Motion:  Very strong match, one of the examples is a specific case.
7. Einstein's Theory of Relativity: While it has classical limits, it's a more modern theory that goes beyond classical physics in many aspects. Not a strong match.
8. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction: Classical physics, macroscopic phenomenon. Good match.

Let's assign scores, ensuring granularity:

1. Ohm's Law: 9
2. Avogadro's Law: 9
3. Maxwell's Equations: 8
4. Hooke's Law: 9
5. Planck's Law: 5
6. Newton's Laws of Motion: 10
7. Einstein's Theory of Relativity: 2
8. Faraday's Law: 9<number>1</number><score>9</score>
