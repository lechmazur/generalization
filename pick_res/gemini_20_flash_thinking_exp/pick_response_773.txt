The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and then score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader related themes indicated by the anti-examples.

Let's analyze the examples:
- Autonomous electric shuttle services in city centers:  Focuses on *new*, *on-demand*, *electric*, *small-scale*, *urban* transport.
- Ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft: Focuses on *new*, *on-demand*, *private vehicle*, *urban* transport.
- Bicycle-sharing system in cities: Focuses on *new*, *shared*, *human-powered*, *small-scale*, *urban* transport.

The core theme seems to be the introduction of *new*, *on-demand* or *shared*, *small-scale* transportation *services* within *urban* environments. The electric aspect is present in one example but not crucial to the core idea.

Now let's analyze the anti-examples:
- Car-sharing services: Similar to the theme but focuses on *self-drive* rather than *on-demand service*.
- Expansion of bicycle lanes: Focuses on *infrastructure* rather than a *service*.
- Implementation of electric buses: Focuses on *large-scale*, *scheduled* public transport rather than *on-demand* or *shared* services.

The anti-examples highlight that the theme is not just about any urban transport innovation, infrastructure improvements, or large-scale public transport.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates against the specific theme:

1. Smart traffic management systems: Focuses on *optimization* of existing traffic, not a new transport *service*. Low score.
2. Expansion of public bus networks: Focuses on *traditional*, *scheduled* public transport, not a new *on-demand* or *shared* service. Low score.
3. Introduction of congestion pricing: Focuses on *managing demand* for existing transport, not a new transport *service*. Low score.
4. Creation of pedestrian-only zones: Focuses on *infrastructure* and *restricting* vehicle movement, not a new transport *service*. Low score.
5. Implementation of electric scooters as a rental service: Fits the theme well - *new*, *shared*, *small-scale*, *urban* transport *service*. High score.
6. Introduction of GPS navigation systems:  A *tool* that facilitates transport, but not a transport *service* itself. Medium-low score.
7. Establishment of carpooling programs:  Focuses on *sharing* existing private vehicles, not a *new* transport *service* in the same way. Medium score.
8. Creation of the first subway system:  Focuses on *large-scale*, *scheduled* public transport, not a *new*, *on-demand* or *shared*, *small-scale* service. Low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
