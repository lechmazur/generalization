The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme related to marine ecosystems. The examples highlight specific geological features that support unique biological communities through chemosynthesis or enhanced productivity. The anti-examples are broader marine environments.

The task is to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit the *specific* theme, not a broader interpretation.

Let's analyze the candidates:

*   **Salt marshes:** Coastal, but not necessarily driven by specific geological features or chemosynthesis. More general coastal ecosystem.
*   **Kelp forests:** Productive, but not directly linked to specific geological features like vents or seeps.
*   **Estuaries:** Transition zones, productive, but broad category.
*   **Rocky intertidal zones:**  Defined by tidal action, not specific geological features driving unique communities.
*   **Deep-sea coral reefs:**  Deep-sea, providing shelter, but the examples emphasize chemosynthesis or upwelling. This is closer than the others.
*   **Continental shelves:** Broad geographic feature, not a specific ecosystem.
*   **Coral reefs in shallow, sunlit waters:**  Productive, but driven by photosynthesis, not the specific features in the examples.
*   **Seagrass beds:** Productive, but not directly linked to specific geological features.

Based on this analysis, the deep-sea coral reefs are the closest match due to the "deep-sea" aspect and the provision of shelter, which aligns with the idea of specific habitats supporting unique communities. The other candidates are more general marine environments.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
