The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are Miami Circle, Majorville Medicine Wheel, and Bighorn Medicine Wheel. The anti-examples are Callanish Stones, Ring of Brodgar, and Avebury.

From the examples, the specific theme seems to be **North American prehistoric stone circles or structures, often with astronomical alignments or ceremonial purposes, and potentially associated with indigenous cultures.**

The anti-examples are all European megalithic stone circles. This confirms that the user wants me to differentiate between North American and European examples, and potentially focus on the specific characteristics of the North American examples.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

*   **Rollright Stones:**  A complex of three megalithic monuments in England. Likely a low score.
*   **Newark Earthworks:**  Large prehistoric earthworks built by the Hopewell culture in Ohio, USA. While prehistoric and in North America, they are earthworks, not stone circles. Likely a moderate score.
*   **Serpent Mound:**  A large effigy mound in Ohio, USA. Similar to Newark Earthworks, it's an earthwork, not a stone circle. Likely a moderate score.
*   **Stonehenge:**  A famous prehistoric stone circle in England. Definitely a low score based on the anti-examples.
*   **Woodhenge (England):**  A Neolithic henge and timber circle in England. Low score.
*   **Newgrange:**  A prehistoric monument in Ireland, a passage tomb. Low score.
*   **Cahokia Woodhenge:**  A series of timber circles at the Cahokia site in Illinois, USA. While made of wood, the concept is similar to the examples. Likely a high score.
*   **Carnac stones:**  An exceptionally dense collection of megalithic sites in Brittany, France, comprising alignments, dolmens, tumuli and single menhirs. Low score.

Now I will assign scores, trying to use the full range and avoid polarization.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>5</score>
<number>3</number><score>4</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>8</score>
<number>8</number><score>1</score>
