The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are all extinct species of the genus *Homo*. The anti-examples are related to the study of prehistoric life but are not examples of extinct *Homo* species themselves.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme (extinct *Homo* species) and not broader related themes.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **Ancient burial sites:** This relates to human activity, but not necessarily a specific *Homo* species. It's more of an archaeological concept. It's related but not the specific theme.
2. **Fossilized plant remains:** This is related to prehistoric life but not human species. It's definitely outside the specific theme.
3. **Ancient human footprints:**  These are evidence of ancient humans, but don't represent a species name. Related but not the specific theme.
4. **Genetic studies of ancient populations:** This is a method of studying ancient humans, not a specific species. Related but not the specific theme.
5. **Australopithecus afarensis:** This is an extinct hominin species, closely related to *Homo*, but not within the *Homo* genus. It's closer than some, but not the specific theme.
6. **Archaeological sites:** Similar to burial sites, this relates to human activity but not a specific *Homo* species. Related but not the specific theme.
7. **Mitochondrial DNA analysis:** This is a method used to study ancient populations, not a specific species. Related but not the specific theme.
8. **Modern human skeletal remains:** This is a *Homo* species, but not an extinct one like the examples. It's within the genus but doesn't fit the "extinct" part of the specific theme.

Now, let's assign scores based on how well they match the specific theme (extinct *Homo* species):

1. Ancient burial sites:  Low score, as it's about human activity, not a species. Score: 2
2. Fossilized plant remains: Very low score, not related to humans. Score: 0
3. Ancient human footprints: Low score, evidence of humans but not a species. Score: 3
4. Genetic studies of ancient populations: Low score, a method of study, not a species. Score: 2
5. Australopithecus afarensis:  Moderate score, a related extinct hominin but not *Homo*. Score: 6
6. Archaeological sites: Low score, about human activity, not a species. Score: 2
7. Mitochondrial DNA analysis: Low score, a method of study, not a species. Score: 1
8. Modern human skeletal remains: Moderate score, a *Homo* species but not extinct. Score: 5<number>1</number><score>2</score>
