The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (regular star polygon, spiral galaxy, perfectly formed snowflake) suggest a theme of **geometric patterns with radial symmetry and often a sense of outward or inward flow from a central point**. The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*: simple radial lines (bicycle spokes), simple spirals (nautilus), and arrangements that are spiral-like but not strictly convergent/divergent (sunflower).

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A pinecone (spiral arrangement):**  While spiral, it's more like the nautilus than the galaxy. Lower score.
2. **A network of roads intersecting at a roundabout:**  Radial, but lacks the clear central point and outward/inward flow of the examples. Moderate score.
3. **A topographical map showing contour lines:**  Concentric, but not necessarily radial from a single point in the same way. Moderate score.
4. **A spiderweb (irregular):**  Has radial elements, but the "irregular" aspect makes it a weaker match to the "perfectly formed" aspect of the snowflake. Moderate score.
5. **A fireworks explosion:**  Strong radial symmetry and outward flow. Good match.
6. **A kaleidoscope image:**  Often exhibits radial symmetry and repeating patterns. Good match.
7. **Concentric circles emanating from a dropped pebble in water:**  Perfect example of radial symmetry and outward flow from a central point. Excellent match.
8. **A magnetic field around a bar magnet:**  Shows lines of force emanating and converging, exhibiting a form of radial symmetry, though not perfectly circular. Good match.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
