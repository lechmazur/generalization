The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples.

The core elements of the theme seem to be:
- **Waste transformation:** Converting waste into a useful resource.
- **Closed-loop system:** The process occurs within a contained environment, and the output is used within that same system or a closely related one.
- **Resource recovery:** The waste is not just treated or disposed of, but transformed into a valuable resource.

The anti-examples highlight the importance of the "closed-loop" and "contained environment" aspects. They involve waste transformation but lack the closed-loop nature.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10 based on how well it fits the specific theme, emphasizing the closed-loop and resource recovery aspects.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

1. **Recycling program for aluminum cans:**  Recycles waste, but not within a closed-loop. Similar to the plastic bottle recycling anti-example.
2. **Bioreactor for soil pollutants:** Transforms pollutants, but not necessarily in a closed-loop system. Similar to the wastewater treatment plant anti-example.
3. **Closed-loop industrial process:**  Explicitly mentions "closed-loop" and "recycles byproducts." This seems like a strong match.
4. **Industrial process using waste heat:** Uses waste, but doesn't transform it into a new resource. Doesn't fit the resource recovery aspect.
5. **Landfill gas recovery:** Recovers a resource (methane) from waste, but not necessarily in a tightly closed-loop system from the outset.
6. **Recycling center:** Similar to the aluminum can recycling program and the plastic bottle recycling anti-example.
7. **Biomass power plant:** Uses waste (wood chips) for energy, but not in a closed-loop system.
8. **Municipal composting program:** Similar to the yard waste composting facility anti-example. Transforms waste, but not in a contained, closed-loop system.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
