The user wants me to identify the specific theme shared by the "good" examples and differentiate it from the broader themes represented by the "bad" examples.

Good examples:
- Convention on Biological Diversity (Biodiversity conservation)
- Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Atmospheric protection - ozone layer)
- Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (Habitat conservation - wetlands)

Bad examples:
- Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Species conservation - migratory)
- Kyoto Protocol (Climate change mitigation)
- Paris Agreement on Climate Change (Climate change mitigation)

The specific theme seems to be **multilateral environmental agreements focused on specific environmental issues, often with a strong conservation or protection component, but not necessarily focused on climate change or migratory species.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.

1. International Whaling Commission: Focuses on the conservation of whale stocks and the regulation of whaling. While it's about conservation, it's very species-specific. Closer to the "bad" example of migratory species.
2. Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade: Focuses on regulating hazardous substances. This is about environmental protection but has a strong trade/regulation aspect.
3. Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES): Focuses on regulating trade in endangered species. Species-specific, but with a conservation focus.
4. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: Clearly a "bad" example theme.
5. Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes: Focuses on regulating hazardous waste. Similar to the Rotterdam Convention.
6. International Maritime Organization's Marine Pollution Conventions: Focuses on preventing marine pollution. Environmental protection, but sector-specific (maritime).
7. Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants: Focuses on eliminating or restricting persistent organic pollutants. Similar to Rotterdam and Basel.
8. Minamata Convention on Mercury: Focuses on protecting human health and the environment from mercury. Similar to Rotterdam, Basel, and Stockholm.

Let's assign scores:

- Candidates focusing on specific environmental issues with a conservation/protection component will score higher.
- Candidates focusing on climate change will score low.
- Candidates focusing on specific species or groups of species might score lower than broader habitat or issue-based conventions.
- Candidates focusing on the regulation of hazardous substances will score moderately.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
