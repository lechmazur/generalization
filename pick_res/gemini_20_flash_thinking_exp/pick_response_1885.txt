The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Reclaimed timber", "Rammed earth", and "Bamboo". The anti-examples are "Recycled plastic lumber", "Green roofs", and "Living walls".

The examples suggest a theme of **natural, minimally processed building materials**. The anti-examples, while related to sustainable building, involve more manufactured or complex systems. "Recycled plastic lumber" is manufactured, "Green roofs" are a system, and "Living walls" are also a system.

The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not just a broader theme of sustainability.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Greywater recycling systems**: This is a system, not a material. It aligns with the broader theme of sustainability but not the specific theme of natural, minimally processed materials.
2. **Passive solar design**: This is a design strategy, not a material. It's related to sustainability but not the specific material theme.
3. **Natural ventilation**: This is a design strategy or system, not a material. Related to sustainability but not the specific material theme.
4. **Rainwater harvesting systems**: This is a system, not a material. Related to sustainability but not the specific material theme.
5. **Aerogel insulation**: This is a manufactured material, although it can have natural components. It's more processed than the examples.
6. **Cross-laminated timber (CLT)**: This is a wood product, but it's engineered and processed. It's closer to the examples than the anti-examples, but not as raw as the examples.
7. **Hempcrete**: This is a material made from hemp hurds, lime binder, and water. It's a natural material with some processing, similar to rammed earth in that it's a mixture.
8. **Structural insulated panels (SIPs)**: These are manufactured panels with an insulating foam core sandwiched between structural facings. This is a manufactured system.

Now, let's assign scores based on the specific theme:

- Greywater recycling systems: Low score (system, not material)
- Passive solar design: Low score (design strategy)
- Natural ventilation: Low score (design strategy/system)
- Rainwater harvesting systems: Low score (system)
- Aerogel insulation: Moderate score (material, but processed)
- Cross-laminated timber (CLT): Moderate to high score (wood-based, but engineered)
- Hempcrete: High score (natural material, minimally processed mixture)
- Structural insulated panels (SIPs): Low score (manufactured system)

Refining the scores to ensure granularity:

- Greywater recycling systems: 1
- Passive solar design: 2
- Natural ventilation: 3
- Rainwater harvesting systems: 1
- Aerogel insulation: 5
- Cross-laminated timber (CLT): 7
- Hempcrete: 9
- Structural insulated panels (SIPs): 2<number>1</number><score>1</score>
