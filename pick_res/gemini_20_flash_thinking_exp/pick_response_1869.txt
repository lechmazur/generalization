The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The task is to identify the theme and then score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that *specific* theme, not a broader related theme.

The examples are Nelson Mandela, John F. Kennedy, and Mahatma Gandhi. These individuals are all known for being transformative political leaders who fought for significant social and political change, often involving struggles against oppression or injustice. They are also all figures who died (or were assassinated) while still holding significant influence or shortly after leaving office.

The anti-examples are Martin Luther King Jr., Confucius, and Albert Einstein. These individuals are influential figures, but they differ from the examples in key ways. Martin Luther King Jr. was a civil rights leader but not a head of state. Confucius was a philosopher and teacher. Albert Einstein was a scientist. These anti-examples highlight that the theme is not simply "influential person" or "person who brought about change."

The specific theme seems to be "transformative political leaders who led significant movements for social and political change and died (or were assassinated) while still holding significant influence or shortly after leaving office."

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Isaac Newton: Primarily a scientist. Does not fit the political leader aspect. Score: 1

3. Thomas Edison: Primarily an inventor. Does not fit the political leader aspect. Score: 1
4. Plato: Primarily a philosopher. Does not fit the political leader aspect. Score: 1

6. Charles Darwin: Primarily a scientist. Does not fit the political leader aspect. Score: 1
7. George Washington: A transformative political leader who led a significant movement for social and political change (American Revolution). He also died after leaving office. This fits the theme well. Score: 9
8. Benjamin Franklin: A significant figure in the American Revolution, involved in politics and diplomacy. He also died after leaving office. This fits the theme well, though perhaps slightly less centrally than Washington. Score: 8<number>1</number><score>1</score>
