The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: Dry-stone wall, Jenga tower, K'NEX model. These all seem to be structures held together by friction, gravity, or interlocking parts, without any adhesive or permanent fasteners.

Anti-examples: LEGO creation glued together, welded metal sculpture, glued wooden chair. These all involve permanent joining methods like glue or welding.

The specific theme seems to be "structures assembled without permanent adhesives or fasteners".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes that the anti-examples might suggest (like general construction or joining).

Candidate 1: A woven basket -  The strands are interlocked, but not permanently fixed. Seems like a good fit.
Candidate 2: A brick wall with mortar - Mortar is an adhesive. Not a good fit.
Candidate 3: A card house - Held together by balance and friction. Good fit.
Candidate 4: A nailed birdhouse - Nails are fasteners. Not a good fit.
Candidate 5: A zipper - Interlocking parts, but not a structure in the same way. A bit ambiguous.
Candidate 6: A dovetail joint -  Relies on the shape for a strong mechanical connection, no adhesive needed. Good fit.
Candidate 7: A mortise and tenon joint - Similar to dovetail, relies on shape. Good fit.
Candidate 8: A jigsaw puzzle - Interlocking pieces, no adhesive. Good fit.

Now to assign scores, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.

1. Woven basket:  Good fit, but the structure is flexible, unlike the examples. Maybe an 8.
2. Brick wall with mortar: Clearly doesn't fit. 1.
3. Card house: Fits the theme well. 9.
4. Nailed birdhouse: Clearly doesn't fit. 1.
5. Zipper:  Interlocking, but not a "structure" in the same sense. Maybe a 5.
6. Dovetail joint: Fits the theme perfectly as a component. 10.
7. Mortise and tenon joint: Fits the theme perfectly as a component. 10.
8. Jigsaw puzzle: Fits the theme well. 9.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
