The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the examples and score the candidates based on how well they match that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader related themes.

The examples all involve:
- A specific, dramatic celestial event.
- This event is described in myths or historical records.
- The event has parallels across different cultures.

The anti-examples involve:
- Common, recurring celestial events (eclipses) or objects (comets).
- These are observations, not necessarily tied to a specific dramatic event with mythical or historical significance.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely **myths or historical accounts of unique, dramatic celestial events that have parallels across different cultures.**

Now, I need to score each candidate based on this specific theme:

- Candidates 1-5 and 8 are myths about constellations or the Milky Way. These are not singular, dramatic events but rather enduring celestial features. They fit a broader theme of cross-cultural constellation myths but not the specific theme.
- Candidate 6 is a historical observation of a supernova. While it's a dramatic celestial event observed across cultures, it's not a myth.
- Candidate 7 is the Star of Bethlehem. This is a specific, potentially unique celestial event tied to a significant historical/religious narrative and has parallels in other cultures. This seems to fit the specific theme well.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
<number>2</number><score>3</score>
<number>3</number><score>5</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>
<number>5</number><score>5</score>
<number>6</number><score>6</score>
<number>7</number><score>9</score>
<number>8</number><score>4</score>
