The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme defined by the examples, while explicitly excluding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core theme seems to be **short-range, chemically-mediated communication within a relatively small, interconnected group of organisms for cooperative purposes.**

Let's break down the examples:
*   **Quorum sensing in bacterial colonies:** Chemical signals, local, population-level coordination.
*   **Tree chemical warning signals through mycorrhizal networks:** Chemical signals, local (within the network), inter-species cooperation.
*   **Honey bee waggle dance pheromone trails:** Chemical signals, local, within the hive, for foraging coordination.

Now let's analyze the anti-examples and why they are excluded:
*   **Whale songs across oceans:** Long-range, acoustic.
*   **Elephant infrasound communication:** Long-range, acoustic.
*   **Wolf pack howling:** Long-range, acoustic.

The key differentiator is the **short-range and chemical nature** of the communication in the examples, contrasted with the **long-range and acoustic nature** of the anti-examples.

Now, let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

*   **Bee visual waggle dance:**  While related to the example, it's visual, not chemical. It's still within the hive and for coordination.
*   **Dolphin echolocation clicks:** Acoustic, not chemical.
*   **Radio signals between military units:**  Artificial, not biological, and not chemically mediated.
*   **Bird dawn chorus:** Primarily acoustic, potentially for individual display or territory, not necessarily tight group coordination via chemicals.
*   **Cricket chirping patterns:** Acoustic, primarily for mating or territorial calls.
*   **Prairie dog alarm calls:** Acoustic, for warning, but not necessarily chemically mediated coordination.
*   **Ant trail pheromones for foraging:** Chemical, short-range, for group coordination. This is a strong match.
*   **Firefly light displays:** Visual, not chemical.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>2</score>
