The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples all seem to be items worn or given to mark a specific coming-of-age or significant cultural/religious milestone.

The anti-examples are also related to significant life events, but they are more general and not tied to a specific cultural or religious coming-of-age ritual in the same way.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Items worn or given to mark a specific cultural or religious coming-of-age or significant milestone ritual.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A family heirloom necklace:** Could be given at a coming-of-age, but not necessarily. More general.
2. **A diploma:** Marks the completion of education, a milestone, but not necessarily a cultural or religious ritual.
3. **A graduation cap:** Similar to a diploma, marks an educational milestone.
4. **A military uniform:** Marks entry into service, a significant life change, but not necessarily a cultural or religious coming-of-age ritual.
5. **A retirement watch:** Marks the end of a career, a milestone, but not a coming-of-age or religious ritual.
6. **A cross necklace received at a Confirmation:** Directly fits the theme of a religious coming-of-age ritual.
7. **A prom dress:** Marks a social coming-of-age event, but less tied to specific cultural or religious traditions compared to the examples.
8. **A driver's license:** Marks a legal milestone of adulthood, but not a cultural or religious ritual.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
