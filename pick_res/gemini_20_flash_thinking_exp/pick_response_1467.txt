The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples suggest a place that was abruptly abandoned, leaving behind personal belongings and equipment. The anti-examples represent places that were systematically emptied or demolished.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "places abruptly abandoned with belongings left behind".

Now, I will evaluate each candidate based on this theme:

1. **An empty warehouse that was cleared out before closing:** This aligns with the anti-examples, not the specific theme. Score: 1
2. **A Japanese elementary school on a remote island with books, desks, and teaching materials intact:** This strongly matches the theme of abrupt abandonment with belongings left behind. Score: 9
3. **A cleaned-out foreclosed home:** This aligns with the anti-examples, indicating a systematic clearing. Score: 1
4. **A ghost town's stripped buildings:** This suggests a gradual decline and removal of items, not abrupt abandonment with belongings. Score: 2
5. **A closed-down airport terminal:** This could potentially fit the theme if it was abandoned suddenly, leaving some things behind. However, it's less clear-cut than the school example. Score: 5
6. **A cleaned-out abandoned mine:** This aligns with the anti-examples, indicating a systematic clearing. Score: 1
7. **A decommissioned military base that was properly cleared:** This aligns with the anti-examples. Score: 1
8. **A bankrupt store after liquidation:** This aligns with the anti-examples, indicating a systematic removal of assets. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>1</score>
