The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are "paper safe", "print tongs", and "film drying rack". These all relate to the handling and storage of photographic paper and film *after* processing. The anti-examples are "print washer", "enlarger", and "print roller". These relate to the processing and creation of prints, but not the post-processing handling and storage.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be tools or equipment used for the physical handling and storage of photographic paper and film *after* it has been developed and fixed.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

1. **safelight**: Used during the development process, not for handling after. Lower score.
2. **darkroom timer**: Used during the development process, not for handling after. Lower score.
3. **film reel**: Used for loading film onto a developing spool, before processing. Lower score.
4. **contact sheet**: A print itself, not a tool for handling or storage. Medium score as it's a result of the process.
5. **thermometer**: Used during the development process, not for handling after. Lower score.
6. **film clips**: Used to hang film for drying after processing. This fits the theme. Higher score.
7. **contact printing frame**: Used to make contact prints, part of the printing process. Lower score.
8. **developing tank**: Used for developing film, part of the processing. Lower score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
