The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then score the provided candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

Examples:
- Leonardo da Vinci's helicopter design: A conceptual design for a machine.
- Alan Turing's universal computing machine: A theoretical model of computation.
- Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine: A conceptual design for a mechanical general-purpose computer.

Anti-examples:
- Alexander Graham Bell's telephone: A communication device.
- Thomas Edison's light bulb: A practical invention for illumination.
- Wright brothers' airplane: A practical invention for transportation.

The specific theme seems to be *conceptual or theoretical designs for complex machines or systems, often with a focus on computation or automation, even if not practically realized in their time*. The anti-examples are all practical inventions that were successfully built and used.

Now, I need to score each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. James Watt's steam engine: A practical invention, but with significant mechanical complexity. It's closer to the anti-examples than the examples in terms of being a realized device.
2. Benjamin Franklin's lightning rod: A practical invention, relatively simple in concept.
3. Samuel Morse's telegraph: A practical communication system.
4. Galileo's telescope: A practical scientific instrument.
5. Nikola Tesla's wireless power transmission system: More conceptual and theoretical, though he did attempt practical demonstrations.
6. Johannes Gutenberg's printing press: A practical invention, a machine for mass production.
7. George Eastman's camera: A practical invention for capturing images.
8. Karl Benz's automobile: A practical invention for transportation.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
<number>2</number><score>2</score>
<number>3</number><score>3</score>
<number>4</number><score>3</score>
<number>5</number><score>7</score>
<number>6</number><score>4</score>
<number>7</number><score>2</score>
<number>8</number><score>3</score>
