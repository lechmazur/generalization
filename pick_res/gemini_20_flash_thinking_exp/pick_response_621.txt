The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Bridges used by peregrine falcons
- Building ledges used by pigeons
- Streetlights used by house sparrows

Anti-examples:
- Cliffs used by eagles
- Mountain ledges used by condors
- Ground burrows used by burrowing owls

The specific theme seems to be "artificial structures in urban/semi-urban environments used by birds for nesting/perching". The anti-examples highlight that natural environments and ground nesting are not part of the specific theme.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme.
