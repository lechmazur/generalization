The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest:
- Indigenous North American origin (Cherokee, Hopi, Navajo)
- Crafted objects
- Used in ceremonies/rituals
- Decorated with specific patterns (concentric circles, geometric designs, diamonds, zigzags)
- Made from natural materials (sweetgrass, cottonwood root, wool)

Anti-examples suggest that the theme is NOT simply:
- Religious objects
- Metal objects
- Vessels

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Indigenous North American ceremonial/ritual objects made from natural materials and decorated with specific patterns.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Candidate 1: Maori carved wooden lintel -  Fits the "crafted object", "decorated with specific patterns", and "used in ceremonies/rituals" aspects. It's made of natural material (wood). However, it's not North American.

Candidate 2: Steel church bell -  Related to religion, but not made of natural materials, not decorated with specific patterns in the same way, and not Indigenous North American.

Candidate 3: Marble altar - Related to religion, but not made of natural materials in the same way as the examples, not decorated with specific patterns in the same way, and not Indigenous North American.

Candidate 4: Stained glass window - Related to religion, but not made of natural materials in the same way, and not Indigenous North American. While it has depictions, they are not the same kind of patterns.

Candidate 5: Glass rosary - Related to religion, but not made of natural materials in the same way, and not Indigenous North American.

Candidate 6: Concrete statue of Buddha - Related to religion, but not made of natural materials in the same way, and not Indigenous North American.

Candidate 7: Synthetic tapestry -  Related to religion, but not made of natural materials, and not Indigenous North American. While it depicts a scene, it's not the same kind of specific pattern.

Candidate 8: Silk prayer shawl - Related to religion, made of natural material (silk), but not Indigenous North American and the "decoration" is likely different.
