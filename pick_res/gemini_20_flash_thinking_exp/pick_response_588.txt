The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples. The specific theme revolves around *interlocking tetrahedra* forming a larger structure. The anti-examples highlight that the theme is *not* just about tetrahedral arrangements at a molecular level.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10, focusing on the presence of *interlocking tetrahedra* as the core element.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1: A Lego structure built from interlocking plastic bricks.**  While interlocking, the shape of Lego bricks isn't necessarily tetrahedral. This is a general interlocking structure.
*   **Candidate 2: A honeycomb structure composed of hexagonal cells.**  Hexagonal cells are not tetrahedra.
*   **Candidate 3: A geodesic dome constructed from triangular panels.** Triangular panels are related to tetrahedra (faces), but it's not explicitly interlocking tetrahedra.
*   **Candidate 4: A modular shelving unit made from interlocking components.**  This is a general interlocking structure, the shape of the components is not specified as tetrahedral.
*   **Candidate 5: A modular building system using interlocking blocks.** Similar to candidate 4, general interlocking, no mention of tetrahedra.
*   **Candidate 6: A mathematical model demonstrating the properties of space-filling using a pattern of interlocking tetrahedra, where each tetrahedron shares at least three faces with adjacent tetrahedra.** This directly matches the specific theme.
*   **Candidate 7: A tessellation pattern on a flat surface using interlocking shapes.**  While interlocking, it's on a flat surface and the shapes are not specified as tetrahedra.
*   **Candidate 8: A crystal lattice structure where atoms are arranged in a repeating pattern.** This is similar to the anti-examples, focusing on atomic arrangement rather than macroscopic interlocking tetrahedra.

Now I will assign scores based on this analysis, ensuring a granular and continuous scale.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>0</score>
<number>3</number><score>4</score>
<number>4</number><score>3</score>
<number>5</number><score>3</score>
<number>6</number><score>10</score>
<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>2</score>
