The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are all passive ventilation/thermal regulation strategies in buildings. The anti-examples are active or localized heat rejection/transfer devices. Therefore, the specific theme is likely **passive building design elements for thermal regulation**.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

*   **Space heater:** Actively adds heat, not passive. Low score.
*   **Heat pump:** Actively transfers heat, not passive. Low score.
*   **Refrigerator:** Actively removes heat, not passive. Low score.
*   **Heat gun:** Actively adds heat to a localized area, not passive. Low score.
*   **Convection oven:** Actively heats an enclosed space, not passive. Low score.
*   **Heat exchanger:** Can be part of a passive system but is more generally an active component. Moderate score.
*   **Trombe wall:** A passive solar heating and ventilation system. High score.
*   **Fireplace:** Actively burns fuel for heat, not passive. Low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
