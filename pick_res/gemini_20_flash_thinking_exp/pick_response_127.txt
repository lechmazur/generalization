The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: Personal computer, Wireless communication, Helicopter
Anti-examples: Quantum computing, Artificial intelligence, Blockchain

The examples seem to point towards *tangible, impactful technological innovations that have significantly changed daily life and communication/transportation*. The anti-examples are more abstract or conceptual technologies.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. Genetic engineering: While impactful, it's more of a scientific process than a tangible technology used by the general public in the same way as the examples. It leans towards the abstract/conceptual side.
2. Virtual reality:  A technology, but more focused on simulation and digital environments. It's related to computers but not quite the same level of fundamental impact as the examples.
3. 3D printing: A tangible technology with growing impact, but perhaps not as universally transformative as the examples yet.
4. Internet: A fundamental communication technology, very similar to "Wireless communication" in its impact.
5. Telephone: A classic communication technology, predating wireless but serving a similar purpose.
6. Electric light bulb: A foundational technology that drastically changed daily life.
7. Radio: A communication technology, similar to wireless communication and telephone.
8. Airplane: A mode of transportation, similar to the helicopter example.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range:

1. Genetic engineering:  Likely a lower score, as it's more of a scientific field than a direct consumer technology.
2. Virtual reality:  Mid-range, as it's a technology but not as fundamental as the examples.
3. 3D printing: Mid-range, growing impact but not yet as ubiquitous.
4. Internet: High score, a core communication technology.
5. Telephone: High score, a classic communication technology.
6. Electric light bulb: High score, a foundational technology.
7. Radio: High score, a key communication technology.
8. Airplane: High score, a major mode of transportation.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
