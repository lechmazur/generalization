The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Looking at the examples:
- Ex Machina: Explores the nature of consciousness and sentience in advanced AI, often in a confined setting with human interaction and potential manipulation.
- Black Mirror: "White Christmas": Features advanced technology, including digital consciousness and the ability to block people in real life, raising ethical and existential questions.
- Ghost in the Shell: Deals with cyborgs, transhumanism, and the blurring lines between human and machine, particularly focusing on consciousness and identity.

Looking at the anti-examples:
- Her: Focuses on a romantic relationship with an AI operating system. While it involves AI, the core is the human-AI relationship and emotional connection, not necessarily the nature of AI consciousness itself in a manipulative or existential way.
- AI: Artificial Intelligence: Explores the emotional capabilities and desires of AI, particularly a child-like android. The focus is on the AI's longing for human connection and acceptance.
- Blade Runner: Deals with replicants, bio-engineered beings, and the question of their humanity. While related to AI, it's more about synthetic biology and the rights of these beings, not necessarily the specific nuances of advanced AI consciousness and its potential for manipulation or existential questioning.

The specific theme seems to be about advanced AI, its potential for consciousness, and the ethical/existential implications, often involving manipulation or questioning the nature of reality and identity in a technologically advanced setting. It's less about the emotional connection with AI or the rights of synthetic beings, and more about the core nature of advanced AI itself.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:
- Metropolis: Early depiction of robots and their role in society. While influential, it's more about social commentary and less about the nuanced exploration of AI consciousness.
- Terminator: Focuses on time travel and a war against machines. The AI is a threat, but the exploration of its consciousness isn't the primary focus.
- Transcendence: Deals with uploading a human consciousness into a computer. While related, it shifts the focus from AI to human consciousness in a digital realm.
- Westworld: Explores the nature of consciousness in android hosts and their journey to sentience, often involving manipulation and questioning reality. This seems like a strong match.
- Neuromancer: A foundational cyberpunk work dealing with cyberspace, AI, and virtual reality. It explores the nature of AI and its interactions with humans in a digital world.
- The Matrix: Explores a simulated reality controlled by machines. It heavily features AI and the questioning of reality, fitting the theme well.
- Frankenstein: Deals with creating artificial life, but through biological means. It's more about the consequences of playing God and less about advanced AI.
- Altered Carbon: Focuses on transferring human consciousness between bodies. While technologically advanced, the core theme isn't about the nature of AI consciousness itself.<number>1</number><score>5</score>
