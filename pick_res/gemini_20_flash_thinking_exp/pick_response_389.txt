The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: Satellite television transmissions, Wi-Fi routers, FM radio broadcasts
Anti-examples: walkie-talkies, CB radios, AM radio broadcasts

The examples all involve wireless transmission of signals at relatively high frequencies for broadcasting or point-to-multipoint communication. The anti-examples involve two-way communication or lower frequency bands.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **one-way wireless broadcasting or point-to-multipoint communication using radio waves or similar electromagnetic radiation at relatively high frequencies.**

Let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **infrared remote controls:** Wireless, but short-range and directional, not broadcasting. Uses infrared light, not radio waves. Lower score.
2. **coaxial cables:**  Physical medium for signal transmission, not wireless. Definitely not the theme.
3. **optical fiber networks:** Physical medium for signal transmission using light, not wireless radio waves.
4. **telegraph systems:**  Wired communication, not wireless. Two-way communication.
5. **landline telephones:** Wired communication, two-way.
6. **Bluetooth headphones:** Short-range wireless, but point-to-point communication, not broadcasting.
7. **ethernet cables:** Physical medium for signal transmission, not wireless.
8. **fiber optic cables:** Physical medium for signal transmission using light, not wireless radio waves.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
