The user wants me to score each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme identified in the examples, while explicitly excluding broader related themes. The specific theme seems to be the application of specific phenomenological concepts (intentionality, phenomenological reduction, existential phenomenology) from specific philosophers (Husserl, Sartre, implicitly Merleau-Ponty). The anti-examples highlight related but distinct approaches (psychoanalysis, moral philosophy, deductive reasoning).

I need to evaluate each candidate and assign a score from 0 to 10 based on this specific theme.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1:** Mentions art but explicitly states no phenomenology. This is a clear mismatch.
*   **Candidate 2:** Uses behavioral analysis, which is related to psychology but not phenomenology.
*   **Candidate 3:** Focuses on sociology, a different discipline than phenomenology.
*   **Candidate 4:** Uses cognitive theories, a branch of psychology distinct from phenomenology.
*   **Candidate 5:** Uses linguistics, a different field.
*   **Candidate 6:** Uses psychological tactics, but explicitly not phenomenology.
*   **Candidate 7:** Explicitly mentions Merleau-Ponty and embodiment, which aligns with the specific theme.
*   **Candidate 8:** Involves political conspiracy, unrelated to phenomenology.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
