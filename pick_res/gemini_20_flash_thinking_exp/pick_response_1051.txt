The user has provided three examples of a specific philosophical theme and three anti-examples. The task is to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples are:
- Radical skepticism:  Doubts the possibility of knowledge.
- Phenomenalism:  Physical objects are collections of sensory experiences.
- Sapir-Whorf hypothesis: Language shapes thought.

The anti-examples are:
- Solipsism: Only one's own mind is sure to exist. (Related to skepticism but more extreme and about existence, not just knowledge).
- Postmodernism:  Skepticism towards grand narratives and objective truth. (Broader skepticism, encompassing social and cultural aspects).
- Cultural relativism:  Moral and ethical systems vary across cultures. (Relates to the idea that truth is not absolute, but in a social/cultural context).

The specific theme seems to revolve around the nature of reality and knowledge, particularly focusing on how our perception and understanding might be limited or shaped by internal factors (mind, language, senses). It's a form of epistemological or metaphysical inquiry that questions the direct access to an objective reality.

Now, let's evaluate each candidate:

1. Social constructionism:  Focuses on how social processes create meaning and reality. It shares some overlap with the idea that reality is not directly perceived, but it emphasizes social factors rather than individual perception or language. It's closer to postmodernism.

2. Scientific realism:  Believes that the world exists independently of our minds and that science can provide accurate descriptions of it. This is almost the opposite of the specific theme.

3. The Matrix (film):  Presents a scenario where perceived reality is a simulation. This aligns well with the idea that our experience might not reflect true reality, similar to radical skepticism and phenomenalism.

4. Intersubjectivity:  Focuses on shared understanding and the construction of meaning through interaction. While it touches on the idea that reality is not purely individual, it doesn't directly address the limitations of individual perception in the same way as the examples.

5. Moral relativism:  Claims that moral judgments are relative to different individuals or cultures. Similar to cultural relativism, it deals with the relativity of values, not directly with the nature of perceived reality.

6. Pragmatism:  Focuses on the practical consequences of beliefs and ideas. It's more concerned with what works than with the fundamental nature of reality or knowledge.

7. Hermeneutics:  The theory and methodology of interpretation, especially the interpretation of texts. While it acknowledges the role of the interpreter in understanding, it doesn't directly address the limitations of perception or the nature of reality in the same way as the examples.

8. Idealism:  The view that reality is fundamentally mental or immaterial. This aligns well with phenomenalism and the idea that our experience shapes our reality.
