The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The task is to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples are:
- Vascular system in plants
- Water distribution systems in cities
- Computer network topology

These examples share the characteristic of being a structured system for distributing resources or information within a larger entity.

The anti-examples are:
- A sewage system (removes waste, not distributes resources)
- A circulatory system model (a representation, not the actual system, and in animals)
- A plumbing system in a building (more localized than city-wide distribution)

The core theme seems to be about established, often large-scale, systems for distributing essential resources or information within a defined entity (plant, city, computer).

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **A respiratory system:**  Distributes oxygen, but within an animal. Similar to the vascular system but in animals, which is closer to an anti-example.
2. **An irrigation system:** Distributes water, similar to the city water system.
3. **A supply chain network:** Distributes goods, a resource.
4. **A database schema:**  Organizes data, but not a distribution system in the same physical sense. More abstract.
5. **A file system on a computer:** Organizes and provides access to files, a form of information distribution.
6. **A power grid:** Distributes electricity, a resource.
7. **A neural network:**  A computational model, not a physical distribution system in the same way.
8. **The lymphatic system in animals:** Distributes fluids and immune cells within an animal, similar to the circulatory system.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
