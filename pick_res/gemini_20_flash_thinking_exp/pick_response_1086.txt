The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: General Relativity, Blood Typing, Antibiotics
Anti-examples: Nuclear weapons, Psychoanalysis, Modernism (in art)

The examples seem to relate to scientific discoveries or advancements that have had a significant impact on our understanding of the world or on human health. The anti-examples seem to be related to technology (nuclear weapons), a field of study (psychoanalysis), and a cultural movement (Modernism).

Specific theme:  Scientific discoveries or advancements that have fundamentally changed our understanding of the natural world or have had a direct and significant impact on human health and well-being.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. The internet: While a technological advancement, it's more about communication and information sharing than a fundamental scientific discovery about the natural world or a direct impact on human health in the same way as antibiotics.
2. Jazz music:  A cultural and artistic form, not a scientific discovery.
3. Television: A technological invention for entertainment and information dissemination, not a fundamental scientific discovery.
4. Space travel:  While enabled by scientific principles, it's more of an application of science and engineering than a fundamental scientific discovery itself.
5. The radio: Similar to television, a technological invention based on scientific principles.
6. Personal computer: A technological invention, an application of existing scientific knowledge.
7. The assembly line: A manufacturing process innovation, not a fundamental scientific discovery.
8. Quantum Mechanics: A fundamental scientific theory that has revolutionized our understanding of the universe.
