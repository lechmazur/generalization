The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are typewriters, vinyl records, and mechanical watches. The anti-examples are digital cameras, digital music players, and eBooks. The core theme seems to be **analog technology for media creation/consumption or timekeeping**. The anti-examples represent the digital counterparts.

I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the "analog technology" theme, specifically avoiding the broader "media/information technology" theme.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

*   **Online streaming platforms:**  Definitely digital. Score: 0
