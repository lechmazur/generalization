The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are Dakar, Accra, and Luanda. The anti-examples are Freetown, Conakry, and Monrovia. The task is to identify the specific theme and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

Looking at the examples, they are all capital cities of countries in Africa, located on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.

The anti-examples are also capital cities of countries in Africa, located on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.

The key difference seems to be the *region* within Africa. The examples are all in West Africa. The anti-examples are also in West Africa, but perhaps a slightly different sub-region.

Let's refine the theme: Capital cities of countries in West Africa located on the Atlantic coast.

Now let's evaluate the candidates:
