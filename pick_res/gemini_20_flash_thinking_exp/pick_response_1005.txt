The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are all forms of Buddhist chanting or ritual music from Asia. The anti-examples are forms of Western or Japanese court music that share some characteristics with the examples (e.g., ritualistic context, vocal music) but are distinct.

The specific theme seems to be **Buddhist ritual music/chanting practices in Asia**.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

1. **Candomblé music:**  Afro-Brazilian religious music. Not Buddhist, not Asian. Likely a low score.
2. **Ma'ulu'ulu 'O Tonga (Tongan royal dance):** Polynesian dance. Not Buddhist, not specifically ritual music in the same sense. Likely a low score.
3. **Native American flute music:** Indigenous North American music. Not Buddhist, not Asian. Likely a low score.
4. **Gamelan music:** Indonesian ensemble music, often associated with Hindu or Islamic traditions, but can have Buddhist connections. It's Asian, and can be ritualistic. Could be a moderate score.
5. **Noh theatre:** Japanese classical theatre. While it has ritualistic elements and some Buddhist influence, it's not primarily chanting or ritual music in the same way as the examples. Could be a moderate score.
6. **Sufi music:** Islamic devotional music. Not Buddhist, but it is Asian and has a spiritual/ritualistic context. Could be a moderate score.
7. **Qawwali:**  A form of Sufi Islamic devotional music originating from the Indian subcontinent. Similar to Sufi music. Could be a moderate score.
8. **Powwow music:**  Intertribal Native American gatherings featuring singing and drumming. Not Buddhist, not Asian. Likely a low score.

Let's refine the scores based on the "granual, nuanced, graded, continuous and not polarized" requirement.

1. **Candomblé music:**  Definitely not Buddhist or Asian. Score: 1
2. **Ma'ulu'ulu 'O Tonga (Tongan royal dance):**  Not Buddhist or mainland Asian. Score: 1

4. **Gamelan music:** Asian, sometimes with Buddhist connections, but not primarily Buddhist chanting. Score: 5
5. **Noh theatre:** Japanese, some Buddhist influence, but not primarily chanting. Score: 4
6. **Sufi music:** Asian (Middle East/South Asia), spiritual context, but not Buddhist. Score: 3
