The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Looking at the examples:
- UNCTAD: Focuses on trade and development, particularly for developing countries, within the UN framework.
- EFTA: A regional trade organization in Europe focused on free trade among its members.
- GATT: A multilateral agreement aimed at reducing trade barriers.

Looking at the anti-examples:
- WTO:  A successor to GATT, but a formal international organization with broader powers.
- NAFTA/USMCA: A free trade agreement between specific countries.
- ASEAN Free Trade Area: A free trade area among ASEAN member states.

The specific theme seems to be *multilateral agreements or organizations focused on trade liberalization, often with a historical or less formal structure than the anti-examples*. The anti-examples tend to be more formalized, larger in scope, or geographically specific free trade areas.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA):**  A free trade agreement between countries in Central and Southeastern Europe. Seems closer to the anti-examples (regional).
2. **International Chamber of Commerce (ICC):** A business organization, not a governmental trade agreement.
3. **Pacific Alliance:** A regional trade bloc in Latin America. Closer to the anti-examples.
4. **Eurasian Economic Union (EEU):** A political and economic union of states located primarily in northern Eurasia. More formalized and broader than the examples.
5. **Mercosur:** A South American trade bloc. Closer to the anti-examples.
6. **Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP):** A proposed trade agreement between several Pacific Rim countries. More formalized and geographically specific.
7. **Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC):** A forum for 21 Pacific Rim member economies that promotes open trade and economic cooperation. Broader than the examples.
8. **European Union (EU):** A political and economic union of European countries with a much broader scope than just trade.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
