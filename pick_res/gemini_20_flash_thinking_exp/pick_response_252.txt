The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: sand, concrete, limestone
Anti-examples: adobe, plastic resin, carbon fiber

The examples are all naturally occurring or man-made materials primarily composed of mineral aggregates. The anti-examples are either organic-based (adobe), synthetic polymers (plastic resin), or advanced composite materials (carbon fiber).

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **mineral-based construction materials**.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Marble: A metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals. Fits the theme well.
2. Plaster: Typically made of gypsum, lime, or cement. Fits the theme well.
3. Brick: Made from clay, which is a naturally occurring mineral. Fits the theme well.
4. Clay: A naturally occurring earthy material. Fits the theme well.
5. Glass fiber: Made from silica, a mineral. While processed, it's mineral-based.
6. Granite: An igneous rock composed of various minerals. Fits the theme well.
7. Titanium powder: A metallic element. While a mineral, it's not typically used as a primary construction material in the same way as the examples.
8. Terracotta: A type of earthenware, made from fired clay. Fits the theme well.

Now, let's assign scores, considering the nuance and avoiding polarization.

1. Marble: Very similar to limestone, a strong example. Score: 9
2. Plaster: A common construction material, fits well. Score: 8
3. Brick: A classic mineral-based construction material. Score: 9
4. Clay: The raw material for brick and terracotta. Score: 8
5. Glass fiber: Mineral-based but processed differently. Score: 6
6. Granite: A natural stone, like marble and limestone. Score: 9
7. Titanium powder: Mineral-based but not a typical construction material in this form. Score: 4
8. Terracotta: Fired clay, a clear fit. Score: 8<number>1</number><score>9</score>
