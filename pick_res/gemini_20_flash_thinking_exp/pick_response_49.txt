The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by "Elevator system using cables for vertical movement", "Construction crane with a cable-based hoisting mechanism", and "Skycam system used in sports broadcasting". The anti-examples ("a cable car", "a ski lift", "a funicular railway") highlight that the theme is not just about cables for transportation, but seems to involve a cable actively used for vertical movement or hoisting of a load.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **a zip line**: Uses a cable for movement, but primarily horizontal and for human transport. Closer than the anti-examples, but not the core theme.
2. **a drawbridge**: Uses cables, but primarily for lifting a bridge section, not continuous vertical movement of a load.
3. **a monorail train**:  Doesn't use cables for its primary movement.
4. **a pulley system for opening curtains**: Uses a cable for movement, but the scale and purpose are different from the examples. Still, it involves a cable moving a load.
5. **a drone with propellers**:  No cables involved in its primary movement.
6. **a hydraulic lift**:  Uses hydraulics, not cables, for lifting.
7. **Robotic cable-driven parallel manipulator**:  Uses cables for precise movement and positioning, fitting the theme well.
8. **a robotic arm with joints**:  Uses joints and actuators, not primarily cables for movement.
