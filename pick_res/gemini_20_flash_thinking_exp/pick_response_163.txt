The user wants me to score each candidate mask based on how well it matches the specific theme identified in the examples, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core theme seems to be: **A mask with a movable lower jaw controlled by a string or cord mechanism, used in ritualistic or ceremonial contexts.**

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

* **Candidate 1: A mask with a snap-on jaw, used in puppet shows.**  The jaw is movable, but the mechanism (snap-on) and context (puppet shows) differ from the theme.
* **Candidate 2: A mask used in theater performances with static features.** This directly contradicts the movable jaw aspect.
* **Candidate 3: A mask with a magnetic jaw attachment, used in educational demonstrations.** The jaw is movable, but the mechanism (magnetic) and context (educational) differ.
* **Candidate 4: A mask with a sliding panel, used in magic shows.** The movement is not a hinged jaw, and the context is different.
* **Candidate 5: A shamanic mask featuring an articulated jaw mechanism activated by a series of strings, used in tribal dances.** This strongly aligns with the theme in terms of mechanism, context, and jaw movement.
* **Candidate 6: A mask with a pull-tab to change expressions, used in children's toys.** The mechanism and context are different. While it has movement, it's not specifically a hinged jaw operated by a string for the jaw itself.
* **Candidate 7: A mask with feathers and beads, worn during Mardi Gras celebrations.**  No mention of a movable jaw or string mechanism.
* **Candidate 8: A mask with a flexible rubber jaw, used in horror movies.** The jaw is movable, but the mechanism (flexible rubber) and context (horror movies) differ.

Now, let's assign scores based on the degree of match:

* **Candidate 1:** Movable jaw, but different mechanism and context. A low-mid score.
* **Candidate 2:** No movable jaw. A very low score.
* **Candidate 3:** Movable jaw, but different mechanism and context. A low-mid score.
* **Candidate 4:** Different type of movement and context. A low score.
* **Candidate 5:** Strong match in mechanism, movement, and context. A high score.
* **Candidate 6:** Different mechanism and context. A low score.
* **Candidate 7:** No movable jaw. A very low score.
* **Candidate 8:** Movable jaw, but different mechanism and context. A mid score.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
