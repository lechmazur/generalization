The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are a gyroscope, a hoverboard, and a self-balancing robot. These all involve active self-balancing mechanisms. The anti-examples are a unicycle, a tightrope, and a skateboard. These require the user to actively balance.

The core theme seems to be *devices that actively maintain their own balance*.

Now, let's evaluate each candidate against this theme:

1. **a helicopter:** While it uses rotors for lift and stability, it doesn't inherently self-balance in the same way as the examples. It requires constant adjustments. Likely a low score.
2. **a bicycle:** Requires a rider for balance. Definitely not self-balancing. Very low score.
3. **a spinning top:**  Maintains balance through gyroscopic effect, similar to a gyroscope. Good match.
4. **a seesaw:**  Relies on counterweight and external force, not self-balancing. Very low score.
5. **a pogo stick:** Requires active user input for balance. Not self-balancing. Very low score.
6. **a Segway:**  Uses similar technology to the examples for self-balancing. Excellent match.
7. **a drone:**  Actively stabilizes itself using sensors and motors. Good match.
8. **a balance beam:** Requires the user to actively balance. Not self-balancing. Very low score.

Let's assign scores, ensuring granularity:

1. Helicopter:  It has some stability mechanisms, but not the core self-balancing. Score: 3
2. Bicycle:  Requires external balance. Score: 1
3. Spinning top:  Uses gyroscopic principles for balance. Score: 8
4. Seesaw:  No self-balancing. Score: 0
5. Pogo stick: Requires external balance. Score: 1
6. Segway:  A classic example of self-balancing. Score: 9
7. Drone: Actively self-stabilizes. Score: 7
8. Balance beam: Requires external balance. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>3</score>
