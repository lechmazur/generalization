The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme related to space missions. The examples (Luna 2, Sputnik 1, Mariner 2) are all early, unmanned space probes. The anti-examples (ISS, Tiangong, Voyager 1) are either crewed space stations or a deep space probe. This suggests the specific theme is "early unmanned space probes".

I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

*   **Huygens Probe:** Unmanned probe, but landed on Titan much later. Doesn't fit the "early" aspect.
*   **Kepler Space Telescope:**  Space telescope, not a probe designed for planetary exploration. Also launched much later.
*   **Vostok 1:**  First human in space. Definitely doesn't fit the "unmanned" aspect.
*   **James Webb Space Telescope:** Space telescope, not a probe. Launched much later.
*   **Galileo Probe:** Unmanned probe, but launched much later and orbited Jupiter. Doesn't fit the "early" aspect as strongly.
*   **New Horizons:** Unmanned probe, but launched much later and went to Pluto. Doesn't fit the "early" aspect.
*   **Skylab:**  Early space station, but crewed. Doesn't fit the "unmanned" aspect.
*   **Hubble Space Telescope:** Space telescope, not a probe. Launched later.

Based on this, I can assign scores considering the "early" and "unmanned probe" aspects.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
