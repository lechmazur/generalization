The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not broader related themes.

Examples: lens, prism, rainbow. These all involve the refraction and dispersion of light.
Anti-examples: telescope, microscope, sound wave. These are related to light or waves but are not the same phenomenon. Telescopes and microscopes *use* lenses, but are not lenses themselves. Sound waves are waves, but not light waves.

Therefore, the specific theme is the refraction and/or dispersion of visible light.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. pendulum:  No direct connection to light refraction/dispersion.
2. aurora borealis: Caused by charged particles interacting with the atmosphere, emitting light. Not directly refraction/dispersion.
3. solar panel: Converts light to electricity. Uses light, but not primarily about refraction/dispersion.
4. gravity: A fundamental force. No direct connection to light refraction/dispersion.
5. electric circuit: Flow of electrons. No direct connection to light refraction/dispersion.
6. magnet: Creates magnetic fields. No direct connection to light refraction/dispersion.
7. black hole: Distorts spacetime and absorbs light. Related to light, but not refraction/dispersion in the same way as the examples.
8. diffraction grating:  Works by diffracting light, which is related to refraction and dispersion.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
