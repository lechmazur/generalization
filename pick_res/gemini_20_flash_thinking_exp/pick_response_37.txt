The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are Chichen Itza Observatory, Big Horn Medicine Wheel, and Stonehenge. The anti-examples are Hubble Space Telescope, Newgrange, and Antikythera Mechanism.

The examples suggest a theme of **pre-modern astronomical observation sites**. Key characteristics seem to be:
* **Pre-modern technology:**  No advanced telescopes or electronics.
* **Fixed, terrestrial locations:** Not space-based.
* **Astronomical alignment/purpose:**  Designed for observing celestial events.

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:
* **Hubble Space Telescope:** Modern, space-based.
* **Newgrange:**  Prehistoric, but primarily a tomb with solar alignment, not necessarily a dedicated observatory in the same sense.
* **Antikythera Mechanism:**  A portable device, not a fixed site.

The task is to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the "pre-modern astronomical observation sites" theme.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Paranal Observatory:** Modern, uses advanced telescopes. Likely a low score.
2. **Greenwich Observatory:**  While historically significant, it became a modern observatory with advanced instruments. Might be a mid-range score depending on the emphasis.
3. **ALMA Observatory:**  Modern, uses advanced radio telescopes. Likely a low score.
4. **Mount Wilson Observatory:**  Historically significant, but used early 20th-century telescopes. Could be a mid-range score.
5. **Keck Observatory:** Modern, uses large, advanced telescopes. Likely a low score.
6. **Very Large Array:** Modern, uses radio telescopes. Likely a low score.
7. **Thirteen Towers of Chankillo:**  Pre-Columbian, appears to have served an astronomical purpose. Likely a high score.
8. **Arecibo Observatory:**  Large, but a modern radio telescope. Likely a low score.

Now, let's assign specific scores, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.

* **Paranal Observatory:** Clearly modern. Score: 1
* **Greenwich Observatory:**  Has historical roots but became modern. Score: 4
* **ALMA Observatory:**  Modern radio telescope. Score: 1
* **Mount Wilson Observatory:**  Early 20th century, a transition period. Score: 5
* **Keck Observatory:**  Modern, large optical telescopes. Score: 1
* **Very Large Array:** Modern radio telescope array. Score: 1
* **Thirteen Towers of Chankillo:**  Pre-Columbian, fits the theme well. Score: 9
* **Arecibo Observatory:**  Modern radio telescope. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>1</score>
