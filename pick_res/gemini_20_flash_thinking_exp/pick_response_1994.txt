The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples suggest wooden objects used for practical purposes (food preparation/serving) and also having a ritualistic or symbolic significance.

The anti-examples are wooden objects with primarily ritualistic/symbolic purposes, but lack the everyday practical use related to food.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Wooden objects used for both practical purposes related to food and having a ritualistic or symbolic significance.**

Now, I will evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **A wooden staff:**  Can be symbolic, but not typically used for food. Broader theme fit, but not specific.
2. **A wooden coffin:** Primarily for burial, no food connection.
3. **A wooden instrument:**  No food connection.
4. **A ceramic bowl:**  Used for food, but not wooden. Breaks the material requirement.
5. **A wooden mask:** Primarily symbolic/ritualistic, not for food.
6. **A wooden sculpture:** Primarily decorative/artistic, not for food.
7. **A wooden platter used for presenting food at feasts and also as a ceremonial object in some indigenous traditions:**  Fits the specific theme perfectly.
8. **A wooden box:** Can store things, but not specifically food-related in a preparation/serving sense, and ritualistic use is less direct than the examples.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
