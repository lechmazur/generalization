The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The core theme seems to be "modular devices with interchangeable components". The anti-examples highlight the "non-modular" aspect.

The task is to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples. I need to assign a score from 0 to 10 to each candidate, ensuring the scores are granular and use the full range.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1: a prefabricated building system with interchangeable wall and floor panels:** This strongly aligns with the theme of modularity and interchangeable components.
*   **Candidate 2: a non-interchangeable car engine:** This directly contradicts the theme.
*   **Candidate 3: a non-upgradable desktop computer:** This also contradicts the theme, focusing on the lack of modularity and interchangeability.
*   **Candidate 4: a fixed-function calculator:** This lacks modularity and interchangeability.
*   **Candidate 5: a one-piece wooden chair:** This is a single, non-modular item.
*   **Candidate 6: a sealed lithium-ion battery:** This is a single, non-modular component, often designed to be integrated rather than swapped.
*   **Candidate 7: a single-function kitchen appliance:** This lacks modularity and interchangeability.
*   **Candidate 8: a single-purpose medical device:** This lacks modularity and interchangeability.

Now, I'll assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>

<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>0</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
