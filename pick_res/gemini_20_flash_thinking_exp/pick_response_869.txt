The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on their match to that specific theme.

Examples: Alcubierre drive, Gravitational lensing, Wormholes
Anti-examples: Gravitational waves, Spacetime curvature, Time dilation

The examples seem to relate to manipulating spacetime for faster-than-light travel or shortcuts through spacetime. The anti-examples are related to the effects and properties of spacetime and gravity but don't involve actively manipulating it for travel.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Hyperspace:**  Often used in science fiction as a method of faster-than-light travel by going "outside" of normal spacetime. This aligns well with the examples.
2. **Event horizon:** A boundary beyond which nothing can escape a black hole. While related to gravity and spacetime, it's not about manipulating it for travel.
3. **General relativity:** The theory that describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime. This is a broader concept, like the anti-examples.
4. **Frame dragging:** The effect where a rotating massive object drags spacetime around it. While a consequence of general relativity, it has potential applications in manipulating spacetime.
5. **Length contraction:** A consequence of special relativity related to the relative speed of observers. This is more like the anti-examples.
6. **Cosmic inflation:** A period of rapid expansion in the early universe. While related to spacetime, it's not about directed manipulation for travel.
7. **Special relativity:**  Deals with the relationship between space and time for objects moving at constant speeds. A broader concept, like the anti-examples.
8. **Black hole singularity:** The point of infinite density at the center of a black hole. Related to extreme gravity but not about manipulation for travel.
