The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "ball clay", "porcelain clay", and "feldspar". The anti-examples are "low-fire clay", "earthenware", and "terracotta".

The examples are all raw materials used in ceramics, specifically those that contribute to the vitrification and structure of high-fire ceramics. The anti-examples are types of finished ceramic ware or categories of clay based on firing temperature, which are broader categories.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of raw materials used in high-fire ceramics, as opposed to broader categories of ceramics.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **ceramic glazes**: Glazes are coatings applied to ceramics, not raw materials used in the body. This is a broader category related to ceramics but not the specific theme.
2. **ceramic tiles**: Tiles are finished ceramic products, not raw materials. This is a broader category.
3. **unglazed pottery**: Pottery is a finished ceramic product, even if unglazed. This is a broader category.
4. **kaolin**: Kaolin is a type of clay, a raw material used in ceramics, and a key component of porcelain. This fits the specific theme.
5. **glazed ceramics**: Glazed ceramics are finished products. This is a broader category.
6. **ceramic vases**: Vases are finished ceramic products. This is a broader category.
7. **stoneware**: Stoneware is a type of pottery fired at a relatively high temperature. While it uses materials from the specific theme, it's a category of finished ware, making it broader.
8. **clay figurines**: Figurines are finished ceramic products made from clay. This is a broader category.

Now, let's assign scores based on how well they match the *specific* theme:

- **kaolin**: This is a direct example of a raw material used in the types of ceramics implied by the examples. Score: 9
- **feldspar**: This is one of the original examples, so it's a perfect match. However, since the task is to evaluate *candidates*, and feldspar isn't a candidate, we focus on the candidates.
- **ball clay**: This is one of the original examples.
- **porcelain clay**: This is one of the original examples.

Considering the candidates:

- **ceramic glazes**:  Related to ceramics but not a raw material for the body. Score: 2
- **ceramic tiles**: Finished product. Score: 1
- **unglazed pottery**: Finished product. Score: 1
- **kaolin**: A raw material, a type of clay, closely related to porcelain clay. Score: 9
- **glazed ceramics**: Finished product. Score: 1
- **ceramic vases**: Finished product. Score: 1
- **stoneware**: A type of ceramic ware, implying the use of the raw materials but is a broader category. Score: 4
- **clay figurines**: Finished product made from clay, but the focus is on the finished item. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>2</score>
