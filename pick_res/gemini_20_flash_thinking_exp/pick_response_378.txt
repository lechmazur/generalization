The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples. The specific theme seems to be about devices that measure emotional or physiological arousal through skin conductance and display it on an integrated screen. The anti-examples are devices that measure other physiological parameters (heart rate, blood pressure) and display them, often on a separate app.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10 based on how closely it aligns with the specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1 (Glucose meter):** Measures blood sugar, not skin conductance. Displays on a screen, but the core measurement is different. Low score.
*   **Candidate 2 (Hydration tracker):** Measures hydration, not skin conductance. Displays on a wristband, which is similar to an example. However, the core measurement is off. Low score.
*   **Candidate 3 (Pulse oximeter):** Measures blood oxygen, not skin conductance. Displays on a screen. Core measurement is different. Low score.
*   **Candidate 4 (Respiratory rate):** Measures respiratory rate, not skin conductance. Displays on a screen. Core measurement is different. Low score.
*   **Candidate 5 (Body fat percentage):** Measures body fat, not skin conductance. Displays on a screen. Core measurement is different. Low score.
*   **Candidate 6 (Stress levels via skin conductivity):** Directly matches the core measurement of the specific theme. Displays on a wristband, which is similar to one of the examples (worn on the finger). High score.
*   **Candidate 7 (Fitness tracker):** Measures steps, not skin conductance. Displays on a device. Core measurement is different. Low score.
*   **Candidate 8 (Blood alcohol levels):** Measures blood alcohol, not skin conductance. Displays on a screen. Core measurement is different. Low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
