The user wants me to score each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme defined by the examples, while explicitly avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The specific theme seems to be everyday objects modified to conceal a hidden compartment. The anti-examples are all about secure containers that are explicitly designed for security and require a key or lock.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether it's an ordinary object with a hidden compartment, not just a secure container.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
