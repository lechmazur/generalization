The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- the event horizon of a black hole
- the shoreline where ocean meets land
- the melting point of ice

These all represent a **boundary or transition zone** where a significant change in state or property occurs.

The anti-examples are:
- a tidal wave (a moving body of water)
- a waterfall (water in motion)
- a volcanic eruption (a release of energy and matter)

These relate to dynamic processes or phenomena, not static boundaries.

Therefore, the specific theme is a **static boundary or interface where a distinct change in state or property occurs**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **a coral reef**: While it's a boundary between living organisms and the water, it's not a sharp transition in state or property in the same way as the examples. Score: 4
2. **a desert oasis**: Represents a boundary between arid and fertile land, a change in environment. Score: 7
3. **a hurricane**: A dynamic weather system, not a static boundary. Score: 1
4. **a geyser**: A dynamic release of water, not a static boundary. Score: 2
5. **a canyon**: A geological formation, a boundary between different elevations, but less about a change in state or property. Score: 5
6. **the interface between fresh and saltwater in an estuary**: A clear boundary with a change in salinity. Score: 9
7. **a tornado**: A dynamic weather phenomenon, not a static boundary. Score: 0
8. **a glacier**: A boundary between ice and the surrounding environment, representing a change in state. Score: 8<number>1</number><score>4</score>
