The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit that *specific* theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: Atlantis, Mount Kailash, The Garden of Eden
Anti-examples: Shangri-La, Asgard, Avalon

The examples seem to represent locations that are:
- Mythical or legendary
- Often associated with spiritual significance or origins
- Difficult or impossible to definitively locate or prove their existence

The anti-examples, while also mythical or legendary locations, seem to differ in that they are:
- More clearly fictional or fantastical realms
- Less tied to specific historical or geographical claims (even if those claims are ultimately unproven)
- Often associated with specific pantheons or literary traditions

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **mythical/legendary locations with spiritual significance and a degree of historical/geographical ambiguity or unproven existence.**

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme:

1. **Mount Olympus:**  A mythical location, home of the Greek gods. Strong spiritual significance, but its location is generally known. Less ambiguous than the examples.
2. **Paititi:** A legendary lost city of the Incas, believed to be hidden in the Amazon rainforest. Fits the criteria of mythical/legendary, potentially spiritual significance, and unproven existence.
3. **Stonehenge:** A prehistoric monument in England. While mysterious and potentially having spiritual significance, it's a real, existing place, not a mythical one.
4. **El Dorado:** A legendary city of gold. Fits the criteria of mythical/legendary, associated with wealth and potentially spiritual significance (in the context of exploration), and unproven existence.
5. **Jerusalem:** A real city with immense religious significance for multiple faiths. Not a mythical location.
6. **The Hanging Gardens of Babylon:**  A legendary wonder of the ancient world. Debate exists about its exact location and even its existence, fitting the ambiguity criteria. Has historical and potentially spiritual significance.
7. **Mecca:** A real city and the holiest site in Islam. Not a mythical location.
8. **The Vatican:** A real city-state and the center of the Roman Catholic Church. Not a mythical location.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
