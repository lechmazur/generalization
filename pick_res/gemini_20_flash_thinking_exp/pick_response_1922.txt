The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific architectural theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit *that specific theme*, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples:
- Borobudur: Buddhist stupa, stepped pyramid structure.
- Ziggurat of Ur: Mesopotamian stepped pyramid.
- Temple of Kukulcan: Mayan stepped pyramid.

Anti-examples (suggesting broader themes to avoid):
- Pyramids of Giza: Smooth-sided pyramids (not stepped).
- Angkor Wat: Elaborate temple complex, but not primarily a stepped pyramid.
- Temple Mount: Religious site, not defined by a specific architectural style like a stepped pyramid.

The specific theme seems to be "stepped pyramid structures serving a religious purpose".

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. Oracle of Delphi: Primarily a sanctuary, not a stepped pyramid.
2. Parthenon: Classical Greek temple, not a stepped pyramid.
3. Newgrange: Passage tomb, not a stepped pyramid.
4. Tower of Babel: Legendary ziggurat, fits the theme.
5. Notre Dame Cathedral: Gothic cathedral, not a stepped pyramid.
6. Hagia Sophia: Former church/mosque, dome structure, not a stepped pyramid.
7. GÃ¶bekli Tepe: Prehistoric sanctuary with circular structures, not a stepped pyramid.
8. Machu Picchu: Inca citadel, terraced but not a classic stepped pyramid in the same way as the examples.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>0</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>9</score>
<number>5</number><score>0</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>3</score>
<number>8</number><score>5</score>
