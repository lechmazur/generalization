The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples all involve a modern product incorporating a traditional craft technique.

The anti-examples all involve traditional crafts as the primary product.

Therefore, the specific theme is: **a modern product incorporating a traditional craft technique in its construction or material.**

Now I need to score each candidate based on this specific theme.

1. **a hand-painted silk scarf**: This is a traditional craft product, similar to the anti-examples. Score: 1
2. **a handwoven rug**: This is a traditional craft product, similar to the anti-examples. Score: 1
3. **a hand-carved wooden bowl**: This is a traditional craft product, similar to the anti-examples. Score: 1
4. **a hand-blown glass ornament**: This could be a modern product, but it's primarily defined by the traditional craft. It's closer than the previous examples but still leans towards traditional craft. Score: 4
5. **a hand-stitched leather wallet**: A wallet is a modern product, and hand-stitching is a traditional technique. This fits the theme well. Score: 8
6. **a smartphone case handwoven with traditional Japanese bamboo techniques**: A smartphone case is a modern product, and the weaving is a traditional technique. This fits the theme very well. Score: 9
7. **a hand-painted ceramic vase**: A vase can be modern, but the description emphasizes the traditional craft. It's similar to the glass ornament. Score: 4
