The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples point towards a hierarchical structure with defined roles and authority. The anti-examples highlight structures lacking this strict hierarchy.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme (hierarchical structure) and not broader related themes. I need to assign a score from 0 to 10 for each candidate, reflecting the degree of match.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Crowdfunding campaign:**  While there might be organizers, it lacks a strict hierarchy. Low score.
*   **Collaborative research team:**  Often involves shared authority and less rigid hierarchy. Low to mid score.
*   **Decentralized cryptocurrency network:**  By definition, lacks a central authority and hierarchy. Very low score.
*   **Cooperative business:** Emphasizes shared ownership and decision-making, not strict hierarchy. Low score.
*   **Grassroots movement:**  Typically arises from the bottom up, lacking a formal hierarchy. Low score.
*   **School grading system:**  Has a clear hierarchy of authority (teacher over student) and a structured evaluation process. High score.
*   **Peer-to-peer file-sharing network:**  Decentralized, no central authority or hierarchy. Very low score.
*   **Town hall meeting:**  Designed for open discussion and input, not a hierarchical structure. Low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
