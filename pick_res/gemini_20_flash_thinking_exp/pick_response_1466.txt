The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they match that specific theme. The anti-examples are designed to be misleading, representing broader or related themes.

Looking at the examples:
- Inner Niger Delta
- Peace-Athabasca Delta
- Ili River Delta

These all seem to be inland deltas, not directly emptying into an ocean.

Looking at the anti-examples:
- Okavango Basin (Inland, but a basin, not a delta)
- Mississippi River Delta (Empties into the ocean)
- Mekong Delta (Empties into the ocean)

The specific theme seems to be "inland river deltas".

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this theme:

1. Fly River Delta - Empties into the Gulf of Papua (ocean) - Low score
2. Yellow River Delta - Empties into the Bohai Sea (ocean) - Low score
3. Shatt al-Arab delta - Empties into the Persian Gulf (ocean) - Low score
4. Zambezi River Delta - Empties into the Indian Ocean - Low score
5. Ganges Delta - Empties into the Bay of Bengal (ocean) - Low score
6. Amazon River Delta - Empties into the Atlantic Ocean - Low score
7. Nile Delta - Empties into the Mediterranean Sea - Low score
8. Okavango Delta - Inland delta - High score

Considering the need for granular and nuanced scores, I will adjust the scores slightly based on how "delta-like" they are, even if they are not inland.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>3</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>2</score>
<number>5</number><score>3</score>
<number>6</number><score>3</score>
<number>7</number><score>3</score>
<number>8</number><score>9</score>
