The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: astrolabe, brass barometer, brass microscope
Anti-examples: quadrant, compass, armillary sphere

The examples seem to be scientific instruments, and two of them are explicitly made of brass. The anti-examples are also scientific instruments, primarily used for navigation or astronomy, but they are not necessarily made of brass.

The specific theme seems to be "brass scientific instruments".

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.
