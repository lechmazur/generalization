The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Museum of the Game (San Francisco) - Focus on video games, history, and public display.
- Computer Game Museum (Berlin) - Similar to the first, focusing on computer games.
- Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Cleveland) - Focus on music history and public display.

The specific theme seems to be a **public museum dedicated to the history and artifacts of a specific form of entertainment or cultural phenomenon.**

Anti-examples:
- Disney animation archives -  Likely internal, not necessarily a public museum.
- Broadway theater storage warehouse - Storage, not a public display.
- Hollywood prop warehouse - Storage, not a public display.

The anti-examples highlight that the theme is not just about storing or archiving related items, but about publicly displaying them in a museum setting.

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of a **public museum dedicated to the history and artifacts of a specific form of entertainment or cultural phenomenon.**

Candidate Evaluation:
1. Television studio equipment room -  Focuses on the production aspect, not historical display. Score: 1
2. A private collector's game room - Private, not a public museum. Score: 2
3. Film restoration facility - Focuses on preservation, not necessarily public display as a museum. Score: 3

7. Concert venue storage facility - Storage, not a public display. Score: 2
