The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are oxymorons. The anti-examples are pairs of opposites. The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of oxymorons, not just pairs of opposites.

Let's evaluate each candidate:
1. good versus evil: This is a pair of opposites, similar to the anti-examples. It's not an oxymoron.
2. heaven and hell: Another pair of opposites, like the anti-examples. Not an oxymoron.
3. positive and negative: A pair of opposites, similar to the anti-examples. Not an oxymoron.
4. sweet and sour:  These are contrasting tastes, but not inherently contradictory in the same way as an oxymoron. It's closer than the previous ones, but not a perfect fit.
5. black and white: A pair of opposites, like the anti-examples. Not an oxymoron.
6. living dead: This is a clear oxymoron, combining contradictory terms.
7. love and hate: A pair of opposites, like the anti-examples. Not an oxymoron.
8. light and dark: A pair of opposites, like the anti-examples. Not an oxymoron.

Based on this analysis, the scores should reflect the degree to which each candidate embodies the oxymoron theme.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
