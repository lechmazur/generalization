The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score new candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all instances of **obligate mutualism**, where both organisms benefit and are often dependent on the relationship for survival. The anti-examples are instances of **facultative mutualism** or **commensalism**, where the relationship is beneficial but not strictly necessary for survival.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether it represents a strong, obligate mutualistic relationship, similar to the examples.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

1. **Bees and flowers:**  Strong mutualism, both benefit. Bees get nectar/pollen, flowers get pollination. Often considered obligate for some species.
2. **Fungi and algae in lichens:** Classic example of obligate mutualism. The fungus provides structure and moisture retention, the algae photosynthesizes.
3. **Plants and mycorrhizal fungi:**  Strong mutualism. Fungi enhance nutrient uptake for plants, plants provide carbohydrates to fungi. Often obligate for the fungi.
4. **Termites and protozoa:** Obligate mutualism. Protozoa in termite guts digest cellulose, termites provide a habitat.
5. **Clownfish and sea anemones:**  Strong mutualism. Clownfish get protection, anemones get cleaning and circulation. Often considered obligate for clownfish.
6. **Wolves and ravens:**  Facultative mutualism or commensalism. Ravens may get scraps, wolves may benefit from ravens finding carcasses. Not obligate.
7. **Birds and crocodiles:**  Facultative mutualism or commensalism. Birds may get food from crocodile teeth, crocodiles may get cleaning. Not obligate.
8. **Humans and honeyguides:**  Facultative mutualism. Humans get honey, honeyguides get access to the honeycomb. Not obligate.

Now I will assign scores based on the strength of the obligate mutualistic relationship.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
<number>2</number><score>10</score>
<number>3</number><score>9</score>
<number>4</number><score>10</score>
<number>5</number><score>8</score>
<number>6</number><score>3</score>
<number>7</number><score>2</score>
<number>8</number><score>4</score>
