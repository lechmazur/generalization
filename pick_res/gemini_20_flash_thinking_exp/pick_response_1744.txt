The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Let's analyze the examples:
- Magic lantern: projects an image onto a surface.
- Stereoscope: creates a 3D image by presenting slightly different images to each eye.
- Magnifying glass: enlarges the apparent size of an object.

Now let's analyze the anti-examples:
- Telescope: used for viewing distant objects.
- Loupe: a small magnifying glass, often used by jewelers.
- Pair of binoculars: two telescopes mounted side-by-side for viewing distant objects with both eyes.

The specific theme seems to revolve around devices that manipulate light to create or enhance an image for direct viewing, often involving a single lens or a simple optical system and intended for relatively close objects or projected images. The anti-examples focus on viewing distant objects.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Spectroscope: Analyzes the spectrum of light. While it manipulates light, its primary function isn't image creation in the same way as the examples. Likely a low score.
2. Light microscope: Uses multiple lenses to magnify very small objects. It magnifies, like a magnifying glass, but is more complex. Might be a mid-range score.
3. Pinhole camera: Creates an image by passing light through a small hole. It creates an image, but doesn't involve lenses in the same way as the examples. Could be a mid-range score.
4. Microscope: A general term, but usually implies a light microscope. Similar to candidate 2.
5. Camera obscura: Projects an image onto a surface. Similar to a magic lantern. Likely a high score.
6. Periscope: Used for viewing objects from a concealed position, often involving mirrors. Focuses on viewing, but not in the same way as the examples. Likely a low score.
7. Magnifying mirror: Enlarges the reflection of an object. Similar to a magnifying glass, but uses reflection. Could be a mid-range score.
8. Slide viewer: Used to view photographic slides, often with magnification. Similar to a stereoscope in that it's for viewing prepared images. Likely a high score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
