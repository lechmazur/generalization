The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme defined by the examples, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core of the theme seems to be about visual representations that reveal different information or structures based on the viewing angle or method.

Let's analyze each candidate against this specific theme:

*   **Collages made from overlapping images:**  While they have layers, the change isn't based on viewing angle or method in the same way as the examples.
*   **Scientific diagrams with labeled layers:** These show structure, but not through a change in viewing.
*   **Holographic art pieces that display different images depending on the light source and angle:** This strongly aligns with the theme of changing visual information based on viewing conditions.
*   **3D printed objects with internal structures:** The internal structure is fixed, not revealed by a change in viewing.
*   **Landscape paintings showing depth through layering:** This is a static representation of depth, not a change based on viewing.
*   **Geological strata visible in cliff faces:**  These are layers, but the visual information doesn't change based on how you look at them.
*   **Photographs with multiple exposures:** This combines multiple images, but not in a way that changes based on viewing angle in real-time.
*   **Virtual reality environments with multiple layers of interaction:**  The layers are interactive, not visually revealed by a change in viewing angle in the same way as the examples.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
