The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (multi-layered cake, Earth's atmosphere, semiconductor chip) all share the characteristic of being composed of distinct, concentric layers or strata.

The anti-examples (sedimentary rock, canyon, glacier) relate to geological formations, which might seem related to the Earth's atmosphere, but they don't inherently emphasize a layered structure in the same way.

Therefore, the specific theme is "something composed of distinct, concentric layers".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **a volcano:** Can have layers of lava flows, but not necessarily concentric. Score: 5
2. **a tree trunk:** Has growth rings, which are concentric layers. Score: 8
3. **a stalactite:** Grows in layers, but not necessarily concentric in the same way as the examples. Score: 4
4. **a coral reef:**  A complex structure, but not primarily defined by concentric layers. Score: 2
5. **an onion:**  Clearly composed of concentric layers. Score: 9
6. **a river delta:** Formed by sediment deposition, which can create layers, but not necessarily concentric. Score: 3
7. **a geode:** Has distinct layers of crystal growth inside. Score: 7
8. **a mountain range:** A large geological feature, not defined by concentric layers. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>5</score>
