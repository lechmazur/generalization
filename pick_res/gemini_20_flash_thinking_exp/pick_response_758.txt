The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by the initial examples, while explicitly avoiding matching broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The core of the specific theme seems to be a system that:
1. Processes real-time data.
2. Uses this data to make decisions or guide actions.
3. Involves user interaction to influence these decisions or actions.

The anti-examples lack the user interaction component for decision-making.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on these three criteria, with a strong emphasis on the user interaction aspect.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>3</score>
<number>4</number><score>9</score>
<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>2</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
