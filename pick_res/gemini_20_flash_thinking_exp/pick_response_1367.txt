The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Dewy pine", "Sundew", and "Rainbow plant". The anti-examples are "Pitcher plant", "Insectivorous plant", and "Carnivorous plant".

The examples all seem to refer to plants that trap insects using a sticky substance. The anti-examples refer to broader categories of insect-eating plants, including those that use traps other than sticky substances (like the pitcher plant).

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "plants that trap insects using a sticky substance".

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes.

1. **Cobra lily:**  While carnivorous, it's a pitcher plant, not a sticky trap. Low score.
2. **Bladderwort:** Uses suction traps, not sticky substances. Low score.
3. **Venus flytrap:** Uses a snap trap, not a sticky substance. Low score.
4. **Sticky weed:** The name explicitly suggests stickiness. High score.
5. **Flypaper:**  An artificial sticky trap, not a plant. Moderate score, as it relates to the "sticky" aspect of the theme.
6. **Spider web:** A sticky trap, but made by an animal, not a plant. Moderate score, as it relates to the "sticky" aspect of the theme.
7. **Sticky trap:** A general term for a sticky trap, not a specific plant. Moderate score, as it relates to the "sticky" aspect of the theme.
8. **Butterwort:** Known for its sticky leaves that trap insects. High score.

Now, I need to assign granular scores between 0 and 10.

1. Cobra lily: 1 (clearly not a sticky trap plant)
2. Bladderwort: 0 (uses suction)
3. Venus flytrap: 0 (uses a snap trap)
4. Sticky weed: 9 (directly describes the mechanism)
5. Flypaper: 6 (sticky, but not a plant)
6. Spider web: 5 (sticky, but not a plant)
7. Sticky trap: 7 (describes the mechanism, but not a specific plant)
8. Butterwort: 10 (classic example of a sticky trap plant)<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>0</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>9</score>
<number>5</number><score>6</score>
<number>6</number><score>5</score>
<number>7</number><score>7</score>
<number>8</number><score>10</score>
