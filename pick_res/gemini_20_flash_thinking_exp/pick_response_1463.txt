The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest objects with magical or extraordinary properties attributed to them.
Anti-examples suggest objects used for divination or with religious significance, but not necessarily inherently magical in their origin or nature.

The specific theme seems to be **objects believed to possess inherent magical properties or grant supernatural abilities**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

1. **A map claiming to show the location of El Dorado:** This is about finding a place, not an object with inherent magical properties. It's more about the promise of wealth than inherent magic.
2. **A bezoar purported to protect against poison:** This fits the theme well. It's an object believed to have a specific magical property (protection).
3. **A mummified cat from ancient Egypt:** While potentially having cultural or religious significance, it doesn't inherently fit the "magical object" theme.
4. **A collection of ancient Roman coins:** These are historical artifacts, not objects believed to have magical properties.
5. **A cabinet of curiosities containing natural specimens:** This is a collection of interesting items, but not necessarily objects believed to have inherent magical powers.
6. **A shrunken head from a tribal culture:**  This could potentially be seen as having magical properties depending on the culture, but it leans more towards ritualistic or cultural significance than inherent magic like the examples.
7. **A library of illuminated manuscripts:** These are valuable and historical, but not inherently magical objects. The knowledge within might be powerful, but the objects themselves aren't the focus.
8. **An automaton that mimics human movement:** This is more about advanced craftsmanship or early technology than inherent magical properties.
