The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by the provided examples, while explicitly avoiding broader, related themes indicated by the anti-examples.

The core theme seems to be a cyclical biological or natural process driven by seasonal changes, involving a period of dormancy or reduced activity followed by a period of renewed activity.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Water levels in reservoirs fluctuating due to rainfall:** This involves a cycle driven by weather, but it's not inherently biological or tied to specific seasons in the same way as the examples. It's closer to the "seasons changing" anti-example.
2. **Coral reefs undergoing bleaching during warmer periods and recovering during cooler periods:** This fits the theme well. It's a biological process tied to seasonal temperature changes, with a period of stress/dormancy (bleaching) and recovery.
3. **Fluctuations in wildlife populations due to predation:** This is a population dynamic, not a cyclical change within individual organisms or species driven by seasons. It's more akin to the "life cycles of insects" anti-example in terms of broader ecological processes.
4. **Tides rising and falling daily:** This is a cyclical natural phenomenon, but it's a daily cycle driven by gravitational forces, not seasonal changes affecting biological activity.
5. **Weather patterns influenced by climate change:** This is a long-term trend rather than a regular, predictable cycle. It's also very broad, like the "seasons changing" anti-example.
6. **Day and night cycles:** This is a daily cycle driven by the Earth's rotation, not a seasonal biological cycle.
7. **Annual cycles of tourism in coastal areas:** This is a human-driven cycle influenced by seasons, but it's not a natural biological process.
8. **Changes in ocean currents:** These are complex and can have cyclical patterns, but they are not directly tied to the biological dormancy/activity cycle of the examples. It's more like the "seasons changing" anti-example in terms of a broader environmental cycle.

Now, let's assign scores using the full range, ensuring nuance:

1. Reservoir levels:  A weak match, as it's a cycle but not biological or strictly seasonal in the same way. Score: 3
2. Coral bleaching: A strong match, fitting the biological and seasonal dormancy/recovery pattern. Score: 9
3. Wildlife populations: Doesn't fit the specific theme, more of a general ecological process. Score: 2
4. Tides: A cycle, but not biological or seasonal in the right way. Score: 1
5. Weather patterns: Too broad and not a clear cyclical biological process. Score: 1
6. Day/night: A cycle, but daily, not seasonal/biological. Score: 0
7. Tourism: Human-driven, not a natural biological cycle. Score: 2
8. Ocean currents: A natural cycle, but not directly related to biological dormancy/activity. Score: 4<number>1</number><score>3</score>
