The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples are "centric diatom", "pennate diatom", and "diatom". The anti-examples are "radiolarian", "foraminifera", and "coccolithophore". The specific theme is clearly "diatom". The anti-examples are other types of plankton with silica or calcium carbonate shells, which are related but not diatoms.

The task is to score the provided candidates based on how well they match the specific theme "diatom".

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **siliceous sponge:** Sponges have silica, but are animals, not diatoms. Low score.
*   **plankton:** Diatoms are plankton, but plankton is a very broad category. Moderate score.
*   **cyanobacteria:**  Bacteria, not diatoms. Low score.
*   **marine diatom:**  A type of diatom. High score.
*   **green algae:**  Algae, but not diatoms. Moderate score.
*   **phytoplankton:** Diatoms are phytoplankton, but phytoplankton is a broad category. Moderate score.
*   **dinoflagellate:**  A type of algae, but not a diatom. Moderate score.
*   **algae:** Diatoms are algae, but algae is a broad category. Moderate score.

Now, let's refine the scores to ensure they are granular and use the full range.

*   **siliceous sponge:**  While they have silica, they are fundamentally different. Score: 1
*   **plankton:** Diatoms are a significant part of plankton, but it's too broad. Score: 4
*   **cyanobacteria:**  Completely different kingdom. Score: 0
*   **marine diatom:**  A specific type of diatom. Score: 9
*   **green algae:**  Related as algae, but distinct. Score: 3
*   **phytoplankton:**  Diatoms are a major component. Score: 5
*   **dinoflagellate:**  Another type of phytoplankton, but distinct. Score: 2
*   **algae:** Diatoms are a type of algae. Score: 6<number>1</number><score>1</score>
