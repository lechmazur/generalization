The user has provided three examples of a specific architectural theme: Tropical Architecture, Critical Regionalism, and Arcology. They have also provided three anti-examples: International Style, Modernism (architecture), and Bauhaus. The task is to evaluate eight candidate architectural styles based on how well they fit the specific theme defined by the examples, while explicitly excluding broader related themes that the anti-examples might represent.

The core of the specific theme seems to revolve around:
- **Contextual responsiveness:**  Tropical Architecture and Critical Regionalism emphasize adapting to local climate, culture, and materials.
- **Holistic and integrated design:** Arcology proposes a comprehensive approach to urban design, integrating living, working, and nature.
- **A degree of self-sufficiency or localized focus:**  While not explicitly stated, the examples suggest a move away from universal or purely aesthetic principles.

The anti-examples represent broader movements focused on:
- **Universalism and abstraction:** International Style and Modernism aimed for globally applicable design principles, often prioritizing form over local context.
- **Functionalism and industrialization:** Bauhaus emphasized functional design and the use of industrial materials and techniques.

Now, let's evaluate each candidate against the specific theme:

1. **Deconstructivism:**  Characterized by fragmentation, non-rectilinear shapes, and a rejection of traditional harmony. This seems far removed from the contextual and integrated nature of the specific theme. Low score.

2. **Metabolism (architecture):**  Focused on organic growth, changeability, and the interconnectedness of building systems. Shares some conceptual overlap with Arcology's holistic approach and the idea of adapting to change, but less emphasis on local context. Moderate score.

3. **High-tech architecture:**  Emphasizes advanced technology, industrial materials, and exposed structural elements. While it can be contextually responsive, its primary focus is on technological expression, which doesn't align strongly with the specific theme. Low to moderate score.

4. **Vernacular architecture:**  Defined by local building traditions, materials, and responses to climate and culture. This aligns very strongly with the contextual responsiveness of Tropical Architecture and Critical Regionalism. High score.

5. **Parametric design:**  A design process driven by algorithms and parameters. While it can be used to achieve contextually responsive designs, it's a methodology rather than a specific architectural style with inherent thematic connections. Moderate score, leaning slightly lower as it's more of a tool.

6. **Organic architecture:**  Emphasizes harmony between human habitation and the natural world, often using natural forms and materials. This resonates with the contextual and integrated aspects of the specific theme. High score.

7. **Brutalism (architecture):**  Characterized by the use of raw concrete, monumental forms, and functional expression. While it can be a response to specific contexts, its aesthetic and material palette don't strongly align with the examples. Low to moderate score.

8. **Postmodern architecture:**  A reaction against the perceived austerity and formalism of modernism, often incorporating historical and decorative elements. While it can be contextually aware, its primary focus is on stylistic pluralism and historical reference, which doesn't directly align with the specific theme.
