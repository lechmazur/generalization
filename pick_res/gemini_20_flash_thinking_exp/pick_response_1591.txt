The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all large-scale mining operations in Southern Africa.
The anti-examples are all protected natural areas or historical sites in Southern Africa.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "large-scale mining operations in Southern Africa".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether it is a large-scale mining operation in Southern Africa, and assign a score from 0 to 10 accordingly.
