The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are contradictory terms combined. The anti-examples are similar but the contradiction is less direct or more easily resolved. The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of direct contradiction, similar to the examples.

Let's evaluate each candidate:
1. **A frozen flame**: Direct contradiction - flame is hot, frozen is cold. Good match.
2. **The darkness of light**: Direct contradiction - darkness is absence of light. Good match.
3. **A small giant**: Direct contradiction - giants are large. Good match.
4. **A quiet storm**: Direct contradiction - storms are noisy. Good match.
5. **An invisible color**: Direct contradiction - color is visible. Good match.
6. **A dry rain**: Direct contradiction - rain is wet. Good match.
7. **A hot ice**: Direct contradiction - ice is cold. Good match.
8. **A silent scream**: Direct contradiction - screams are loud. Good match.

All candidates seem to fit the specific theme very well. Now, let's consider the nuance and gradation. Some contradictions might be slightly stronger or more common than others.

- "Frozen flame" and "hot ice" are very classic examples of oxymorons.
- "Darkness of light" and "invisible color" are conceptually very direct contradictions.
- "Small giant" is a common oxymoron.
- "Quiet storm" and "silent scream" are also common and clear contradictions.
- "Dry rain" is a slightly less common but still direct contradiction.

Let's assign scores, aiming for granularity:

1. **A frozen flame**: 9 (very strong, classic)
2. **The darkness of light**: 9 (very strong, direct)
3. **A small giant**: 8 (strong, common)
4. **A quiet storm**: 8 (strong, common)
5. **An invisible color**: 9 (very strong, direct)
6. **A dry rain**: 7 (strong, but slightly less common)
7. **A hot ice**: 9 (very strong, classic)
8. **A silent scream**: 8 (strong, common)<number>1</number><score>9</score>
