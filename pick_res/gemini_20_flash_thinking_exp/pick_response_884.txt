The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme from the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they match *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples suggest a theme of: **Location - Season - Specific Marine Animal Activity**.

Let's break down the examples:
- Seal Beach, California - winter surfing (Seals are present, but the activity is human-driven)
- Beluga Point, Alaska - spring whale watching (Whales are present, and the activity is observation)
- Dolphin Bay, Florida - fall migration viewing (Dolphins are present, and the activity is observation)

The anti-examples seem to focus on locations named after marine animals, but without the seasonal activity component.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely: **Location named after a marine mammal - Specific season - Observation of that marine mammal's natural behavior.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. Whale Beach, Australia -  Missing the season and specific activity. Could be for general whale presence.
2. Narwhal Bay, Canada - Missing the season and specific activity. Could be for general narwhal presence.
3. Walrus Island, Alaska - summer breeding grounds - Has the location, animal, season, and specific activity.
4. Seal Rock, Oregon - Missing the season and specific activity. Could be for general seal presence.
5. Porpoise Point, Florida - Missing the season and specific activity. Could be for general porpoise presence.
6. Dugong Bay, Australia - Missing the season and specific activity. Could be for general dugong presence.
7. Seal Harbor, Maine - Missing the season and specific activity. Could be for general seal presence.
8. Sea Lion Point, California - Missing the season and specific activity. Could be for general sea lion presence.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>3</score>
<number>3</number><score>9</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>
<number>5</number><score>4</score>
<number>6</number><score>3</score>
<number>7</number><score>4</score>
