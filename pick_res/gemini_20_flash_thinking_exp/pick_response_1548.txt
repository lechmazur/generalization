The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The goal is to identify the specific theme and then score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- A set of graduated measuring cups
- Nesting dolls
- Telescoping ladders

The anti-examples are:
- A collection of progressively smaller boxes, each containing a gift
- A set of sieves with progressively finer mesh
- A set of mixing bowls

The specific theme seems to be items that are designed to fit inside each other, or extend from within each other, for the purpose of saving space or providing a range of sizes. The anti-examples share the characteristic of being a set of items with varying sizes, but they don't necessarily fit *inside* each other or extend from within.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **A set of differently sized screws:**  Screws don't typically fit inside each other. They are different sizes for different purposes. This leans towards the broader theme of "sets of different sizes" but not the specific theme.
2. **Stackable food storage containers:** These fit inside each other for storage. This is a strong match.
3. **A collection of drill bits:** Drill bits are different sizes for different purposes, but they don't inherently fit inside each other. Similar to screws.
4. **A tower built with blocks:** Blocks are stacked, not nested or telescoped. This doesn't fit the specific theme.
5. **A set of weights for a scale:** Weights are different sizes for different measurements, but they don't fit inside each other.
6. **A flight of stairs:** Stairs are a sequence of steps, not items that fit inside each other.
7. **A pyramid:** A pyramid is a single structure, not a set of items that fit inside each other.
8. **A set of cookie cutters:** Cookie cutters are different shapes and sizes, but they don't necessarily fit inside each other, although some sets might be designed to nest. This is borderline.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
