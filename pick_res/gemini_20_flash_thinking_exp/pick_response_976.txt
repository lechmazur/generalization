The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples all involve using visual representations (flowcharts, maps/timelines, circuit diagrams) to explain complex information. The anti-examples use visuals (photos, illustrations) but not in a diagrammatic or schematic way to explain underlying structures or processes.

Therefore, the specific theme is the use of diagrams or schematic visuals to explain complex information, relationships, processes, or structures.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of simply including visuals.

Candidate 1: Graphs show data trends, which is a visual representation of information. However, it doesn't explain processes or relationships in the same way as the examples. It's closer than the anti-examples but not a perfect match.
Candidate 2: Describes exercises in text, no diagrams. This is similar to the anti-examples.
Candidate 3: Code snippets are text, not diagrams explaining processes. Similar to anti-examples.
Candidate 4: Planting instructions are text, no diagrams of plant structures. Similar to anti-examples.
Candidate 5: Text descriptions, no diagrams of car parts. Similar to anti-examples.
Candidate 6: Detailed diagrams of the circulatory system to explain function and structure. This is a strong match to the specific theme.
Candidate 7: Lists species, no diagrams of anatomy. Similar to anti-examples.
Candidate 8: Outlines laws, no flowcharts to explain processes. Similar to anti-examples.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
