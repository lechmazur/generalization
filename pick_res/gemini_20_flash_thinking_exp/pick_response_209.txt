The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all percussion instruments made from natural materials.
The anti-examples are all percussion instruments made from metal.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "percussion instruments made primarily from natural materials like wood, gourd, or bamboo". The broader theme could be "percussion instruments".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

1. **A set of stone chimes:** Stone is a natural material, and chimes fit the general idea of the examples. High score.
2. **A tin whistle:**  While it can produce sound, it's not a percussion instrument. Low score.
3. **A steel drum:** Steel is metal, which is explicitly excluded by the anti-examples. Low score.
4. **A rubber bongo:** Rubber is not a natural material like wood, gourd, or bamboo. Medium-low score.
5. **A synthetic drum:** Synthetic materials are not natural. Low score.
6. **A nylon-string guitar:**  Not a percussion instrument. Low score.
7. **A glass harmonica:** Glass is not a natural material like wood, gourd, or bamboo. Medium-low score.
8. **A plastic recorder:** Plastic is not a natural material. Low score.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
