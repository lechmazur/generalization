The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are "a reflecting telescope", "a spotting scope", and "a binocular". The anti-examples are "a spectroscope", "a magnifying glass", and "a microscope".

The specific theme seems to be "devices for viewing distant objects using lenses or mirrors to collect and focus light, typically for terrestrial or astronomical observation". The anti-examples are related but differ in key aspects:
- Spectroscope: analyzes light spectrum, not primarily for direct viewing.
- Magnifying glass: used for close-up viewing of small objects, not distant ones.
- Microscope: used for viewing extremely small objects, not distant ones.

Therefore, the scoring should prioritize devices that are used for observing distant objects. Accessories or components of these devices should receive lower scores. Devices with different primary functions should also receive lower scores.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

1. **a telescope mount**:  Essential for using a telescope, but not the viewing device itself. Lower score.
2. **a telescope eyepiece**: A component of a telescope, necessary for viewing, but not a standalone viewing device. Moderate score.
3. **a night vision goggles**: Used for viewing in low light, but the underlying technology is different (image intensification). Moderate score, leaning lower due to the different technology.
4. **a refracting telescope**:  Fits the specific theme perfectly, as it's a type of telescope used for viewing distant objects. High score.
5. **a rangefinder**: Measures distance, not primarily for viewing. Lower score.
6. **a telescope tripod**:  Support for a telescope, not the viewing device itself. Lower score.
7. **a periscope**: Used for viewing from a concealed position, often in submarines or tanks. While it uses lenses/mirrors, its primary application is different from the examples. Moderate score.
8. **a camera lens**: Used to focus light onto a sensor for capturing images, not direct viewing. Moderate score, leaning lower as the primary function is image capture.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
