The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples highlight energy generation methods that leverage naturally occurring, cyclical environmental phenomena:
- Geothermal heat pumps: Earth's constant temperature cycles
- Wind turbines: Diurnal and seasonal wind patterns
- Tidal barrages: Ocean tides

The anti-examples highlight energy generation methods that, while related to renewable energy, don't directly fit the cyclical environmental phenomena aspect:
- Concentrated solar power: Focuses sunlight, not a direct cycle.
- Offshore wind farms: Still wind power, but the location is the differentiator, not the cyclical nature.
- Solar panels: Directly convert sunlight, not relying on a cycle.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **energy generation that directly harnesses naturally occurring, predictable environmental cycles.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Photovoltaic systems that store energy in batteries:** While related to solar energy, the storage aspect is secondary to the direct conversion of sunlight. It doesn't directly harness a cycle.
2. **Hydroelectric dams that use the flow of rivers:** River flow is influenced by precipitation cycles, but it's not as directly cyclical as tides or daily temperature changes.
3. **Solar thermal energy systems that use the daily cycle of sunlight to heat water:** This directly uses the daily cycle of sunlight.
4. **Wave energy converters that harness the motion of surface waves:** While waves are influenced by wind, they are not as predictable or cyclical as tides or daily temperature changes.
5. **Solar-powered irrigation systems:** This is an application of solar energy, not a direct energy generation method harnessing a cycle.
6. **Geothermal power plants that use steam from the Earth's crust:** This uses the Earth's internal heat, which is constant rather than cyclical in the same way as the examples.
7. **Windmills used for grinding grain:** This uses wind, which has diurnal and seasonal patterns, similar to wind turbines.
8. **Small-scale hydroelectric systems in remote areas:** Similar to large hydroelectric dams, the river flow is not as directly cyclical as the examples.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
