The user wants me to identify a specific theme from three examples and then score eight candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader related themes.

The three examples all involve:
- High-level government officials (President, Minister)
- Scandals that shook the government/political system
- Issues of ethics, legality, and abuse of power
- Questions about the functioning of democracy and the rule of law

The anti-examples involve:
- More general issues of corruption and abuse of power, not necessarily at the highest levels of government or involving a major political scandal.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **major political scandals involving high-level government officials that raise fundamental questions about the integrity of the political system and the rule of law.**

Now I need to score each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **Lobbying scandals:** Can be significant, but doesn't always involve the highest levels or shake the entire system. Likely a lower score.
2. **Campaign finance violations:**  Important, but often more about legal technicalities than fundamental systemic issues. Likely a lower score.
3. **The Profumo Affair:**  Fits the theme well - high-level official, deception, undermined public trust, shook the government. Likely a high score.
4. **Spread of misinformation and propaganda:**  Can be a tool in scandals, but not necessarily a scandal itself involving high-level officials. Likely a medium score.
5. **Bribery of public officials:**  Can be part of a larger scandal, but not always a system-shaking event. Likely a medium score.
6. **Gerrymandering for political advantage:**  Raises questions about fairness, but not necessarily a scandal involving individual high-level misconduct. Likely a lower score.
7. **Election fraud and voter suppression:**  Serious issues, but the examples focus more on misconduct *within* the government. Likely a medium score.
8. **Conflicts of interest in government contracts:**  Can be a component of a scandal, but not always a major, system-shaking event. Likely a medium score.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
