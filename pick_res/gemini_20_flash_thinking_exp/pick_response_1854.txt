The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme related to cooking. The examples point towards *traditional, non-Western cooking tools made from natural materials used for direct heat cooking*. The anti-examples are *Western, often metal-based cooking devices that enclose the heat source*.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

*   **Brazilian churrasco skewers:**  Made of metal, but used for direct heat cooking. Closer to the examples than the anti-examples due to the direct heat aspect.
*   **Campfire:**  The heat source itself, not a tool. Uses natural materials (wood), but not a specific tool.
*   **Clay oven:**  Traditional and uses natural materials, but encloses the heat source, similar to the anti-examples.
*   **Hibachi grill:**  Often metal, but smaller and more direct heat focused than the anti-examples. Has some overlap with the examples in terms of direct heat.
*   **Gas grill:**  Modern, uses gas, encloses the heat source - clearly an anti-example.
*   **Metal skewers:**  Similar to churrasco skewers, but more general. Direct heat, but not natural material.
*   **Tandoor oven:**  Traditional, often made of clay, but encloses the heat source.
*   **Charcoal:**  The fuel source, not a cooking tool.
