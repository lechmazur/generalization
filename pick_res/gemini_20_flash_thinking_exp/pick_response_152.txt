The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples. The core of the theme seems to be a *mandatory* and *cyclical* or *rotational* experience of different societal roles for *every* individual. The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*: assignment based on aptitude, genetic predisposition with choice, or social class.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10, focusing on the mandatory and cyclical/rotational aspect for all individuals, and avoiding scoring based on broader themes like experiencing different jobs or societal roles in general.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1:**  Uploading consciousness to virtual realities is voluntary and not a mandatory part of life or societal structure. It doesn't fit the cyclical/rotational aspect either. Low score.
*   **Candidate 2:** This strongly aligns with the theme. It's mandatory ("throughout their life"), rotational ("rotates through roles"), and applies to every member. High score.
*   **Candidate 3:** Apprenticeship before specialization implies a choice and a finality, not a continuous cycle. It's about finding a specific role, not experiencing all roles. Low score.
*   **Candidate 4:** Body swapping allows experiencing different lives, but it's not necessarily a structured, mandatory, or cyclical system for everyone. It could be voluntary or limited. Medium-low score.
*   **Candidate 5:** "Encouraged to try" implies a voluntary aspect, not mandatory. It lacks the cyclical/rotational structure. Low score.
*   **Candidate 6:** Random selection for governance is about leadership, not a mandatory rotation through all societal roles. It doesn't fit the core theme. Very low score.
*   **Candidate 7:** Assignment based on birth order is a fixed assignment, not a rotation or cycle. It's a deterministic assignment, not a dynamic one. Very low score.
*   **Candidate 8:** Inheriting a trade is a fixed assignment based on family, not a mandatory rotation. It's the opposite of the theme. Very low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
