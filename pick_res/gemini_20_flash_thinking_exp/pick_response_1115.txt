The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

The examples are:
- Gunpowder in ancient China
- Gutenberg printing press in Mainz
- Linear perspective in Renaissance Florence

These examples share the characteristic of being *specific technological or artistic innovations originating in a particular place and time*.

The anti-examples are:
- Egyptian hieroglyphs
- The compass
- Astronomy

These anti-examples are broader concepts or technologies that lack the specific place and time focus of the examples. They are also more general categories rather than specific innovations.

Therefore, the specific theme is *significant technological or artistic innovations with a clear origin in a specific place and time*.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. Greek philosophy: While influential, it's a broad intellectual movement rather than a specific technological or artistic innovation with a singular origin. Score: 2
2. Calendar systems:  Developed over time in various places. Not a single innovation. Score: 1
3. The discovery of penicillin from mold in a London laboratory: This fits the theme well - a specific scientific discovery in a particular place and time. Score: 9
4. Sailing: Developed gradually over time in multiple locations. Not a single innovation. Score: 1
5. Musical instruments: A broad category with diverse origins. Not a single innovation. Score: 1
6. Democracy: A political system, not a technological or artistic innovation. Score: 0
7. Writing systems: Developed over time in various places. Not a single innovation. Score: 1
8. Roman numerals: A system of notation, but less of a groundbreaking technological or artistic innovation compared to the examples. It has a specific origin, but feels less impactful in the same way. Score: 4<number>1</number><score>2</score>
