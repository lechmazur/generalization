The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify this specific theme and then evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match this specific theme. The specific theme seems to be about creative works that are constrained by rules, mathematical principles, or pre-determined structures. The anti-examples highlight works that are spontaneous, improvisational, and lack pre-determined structure.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

Candidate 1: A play with a flexible script that allows for improvisation by the actors. - This leans towards spontaneity and lack of strict rules.
Candidate 2: The visual art of Sol LeWitt, where the artwork is created from a set of instructions or algorithms, resulting in geometric patterns and structures. - This strongly aligns with the theme of pre-determined rules and structures.
Candidate 3: A song written based on the songwriter's personal experiences and emotions. - This is more about personal expression than strict rules.
Candidate 4: A film with a non-linear storyline and loose structure. - This suggests a lack of strict rules.
Candidate 5: A sculpture created through spontaneous artistic expression. - This is the opposite of the theme.
Candidate 6: A piece of pottery shaped by hand without the use of any specific measurements. - This lacks pre-determined structure.
Candidate 7: A painting inspired by the artist's emotions and feelings. - This is about personal expression, not strict rules.
Candidate 8: A novel with a free-flowing narrative structure. - This suggests a lack of strict rules.

Now, I need to assign scores from 0 to 10 to each candidate, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>

<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>2</score>
