The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

Examples:
- virtual reality headsets: allow immersive visual experiences, often with head tracking.
- GPS navigation systems: provide location and direction information.
- the telescope: allows viewing distant objects.

Anti-examples:
- smartphone: a general-purpose communication and computing device.
- satellite: an object orbiting the Earth, used for various purposes.
- binoculars: allow viewing distant objects with both eyes, but lack the advanced capabilities of a telescope.

The specific theme seems to be **devices that enhance or extend human perception of the world, often through specialized technology and a focused purpose.**  The anti-examples are broader technologies that can *include* aspects of the theme but are not solely defined by it.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. space shuttle: While it allows humans to experience space, its primary function is transportation. It's broader than the theme.
2. sonar: Uses sound waves to perceive underwater environments. This fits the theme of extending perception.
3. airplane: Primarily for transportation. While it offers a different perspective, it's not about enhancing perception in the same way.
4. television: Transmits visual and auditory information, but it's a passive reception device, not directly enhancing personal perception of the environment.
5. drone: Can be used for remote observation and data gathering, extending perception.
6. Google Earth: A software application that provides a virtual representation of the Earth. It enhances spatial understanding and visual perception.
7. computer: A general-purpose computing device. While it can be used for perception-enhancing tasks, it's not its primary function.
8. radar: Uses radio waves to detect objects and their location, extending perception.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
