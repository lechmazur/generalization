The user wants me to identify the specific theme from the examples and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (fiber optic cables, satellite communication, cellular networks) all relate to modern digital telecommunications infrastructure.

The anti-examples (undersea cables, smoke signals, semaphore flags) represent older or different forms of communication, some of which share a medium (cables) but not the technology.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely modern digital telecommunications infrastructure.

Now I need to score each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **drums for communication:**  This is a very old form of communication, not digital or modern. Score: 1
2. **internet routers:**  A key component of modern digital telecommunications infrastructure. Score: 9
3. **television broadcasting:**  A form of modern digital communication, although it can also be analog. Score: 7
4. **radio waves:**  The medium used by cellular networks and some satellite communication, but not the infrastructure itself. A bit broader. Score: 5
5. **telegraph:**  An older form of electrical communication, but not digital or part of the modern infrastructure. Score: 2
6. **light signals:**  A very general term. Could be modern (fiber optics) or old (signal lamps). Given the anti-examples, it leans towards older. Score: 3
7. **morse code:**  A method of encoding information, used with various communication technologies, including older ones. Score: 2
8. **carrier pigeons:**  A very old, non-digital form of communication. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>1</score>
