The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

Examples suggest:
- Reflecting pool
- Located at a significant national institution (memorial, art museum, national gallery)
- Located in a capital city
- Located in North America (US, Canada, Mexico)

Anti-examples suggest what the theme is NOT:
- Natural bodies of water
- Reflecting pools on private estates
- Water features at general historic sites

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **A reflecting pool located at a national institution (memorial, museum, gallery) in a capital city.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.

1. **A fountain built in the 1960s in Rome:** Not a reflecting pool. Score: 1
2. **The Canberra War Memorial's Pool of Reflection in Canberra, Australia:** Reflecting pool at a national memorial in a capital city. Strong match. Score: 9
3. **A water feature in a museum courtyard built in the 1990s in Cairo:** Could be a reflecting pool, located at a museum in a capital city. Needs more specificity to be a perfect match. Score: 6
4. **A reflecting pool in a monastery garden in Dublin:** Reflecting pool, but not at a national institution. Score: 4
5. **A reflecting pool in a corporate building constructed in the 2000s in Mumbai:** Reflecting pool, but not at a national institution or in a capital city (Mumbai is a major city but not the capital of India). Score: 3
6. **A pond in a botanical garden in Tokyo:** Not a reflecting pool. Score: 2
7. **A reflecting pool in a private garden in Buenos Aires:** Reflecting pool, but private. Score: 3
8. **A reflecting pool in a university campus built in the 1980s in Madrid:** Reflecting pool in a capital city, but not at a national institution (in the same way as the examples). Score: 5<number>1</number><score>1</score>
