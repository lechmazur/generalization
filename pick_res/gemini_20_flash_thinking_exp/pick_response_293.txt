pick_response_293.txt
The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: frisbee, boomerang, javelin
Anti-examples: bow and arrow, catapult, trebuchet

The examples suggest the theme is "things thrown by hand for sport or recreation". The anti-examples are all devices that launch projectiles, which is a broader theme.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether it is primarily thrown by hand for sport or recreation, and not a device used to launch projectiles.

Candidate analysis:
1. ballista: A large, ancient missile weapon. Definitely an anti-example. Score: 0
2. cannon: A large artillery piece. Definitely an anti-example. Score: 0
3. rubber band: Can be stretched and launched, but not primarily for sport in the same way as the examples. Closer to the anti-examples. Score: 2
4. slingshot: A device used to launch projectiles. An anti-example. Score: 1
5. crossbow: A mechanical bow. An anti-example. Score: 0
6. discus: A heavy disk thrown in athletic events. A strong match to the examples. Score: 9
7. water balloon launcher: A device used to launch water balloons. An anti-example. Score: 1
8. t-shirt cannon: A device used to launch t-shirts. An anti-example. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>0</score>
