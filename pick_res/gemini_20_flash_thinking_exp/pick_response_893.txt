The user wants me to score each candidate based on how well it matches the specific theme identified in the examples, but not the broader theme suggested by the anti-examples.

The specific theme seems to be: **A story set in a historical city where a character experiences existential dread.**

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

*   **Candidate 1:** Dystopian future, societal collapse, no existential dread. Doesn't fit the historical city or existential dread.
*   **Candidate 2:** 19th-century Vienna (historical city), meaninglessness of life (existential dread). This seems like a strong match.
*   **Candidate 3:** 19th-century Vienna (historical city), personal growth, no existential dread. Fits the historical city but not the dread.
*   **Candidate 4:** 20th-century London, anxiety, no existential dread. Fits the city setting but not the historical period or existential dread.
*   **Candidate 5:** Mythical city, existential questions but not dread. Doesn't fit the historical city or the specific focus on dread.
*   **Candidate 6:** Fictional city, philosophical concepts unrelated to existential dread. Doesn't fit the historical city or existential dread.
*   **Candidate 7:** Modern Tokyo, existentialism, no historical setting. Fits existentialism broadly but not the historical city.
*   **Candidate 8:** Post-apocalyptic city, survival issues, no existential dread. Doesn't fit the historical city or existential dread.
