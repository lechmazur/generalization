The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are: an email address, a full name, and a noun phrase describing a concrete object. The anti-examples are: a placeholder image, a demo account, and a blank form. These anti-examples represent abstract concepts or tools used in development or design, but not concrete entities.

The specific theme seems to be "identifiable, concrete entities or pieces of information that represent real-world items or individuals". The broader theme that the anti-examples might fit into is "tools or placeholders used in development, design, or testing".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme (concrete entities/information) and explicitly avoid considering the broader theme (development/design tools).

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

1. **a prop phone**:  A physical object, used to represent a real phone. Fits the specific theme well.
2. **a template document**:  A structure or framework, not a concrete document. Leans towards the broader theme.
3. **a mock-up design**:  A visual representation, but not a tangible object. Closer to the broader theme.
4. **a training dummy**: A physical object representing a person. Fits the specific theme well.
5. **lorem ipsum text**: Placeholder text, not meaningful information. Fits the broader theme.
6. **a beta version**: A stage of software development, not a concrete entity. Fits the broader theme.
7. **a staging environment**: A development environment, not a concrete entity. Fits the broader theme.
8. **a mannequin**: A physical object representing a person. Fits the specific theme well.

Now, I'll assign scores using the full range, ensuring nuance.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
