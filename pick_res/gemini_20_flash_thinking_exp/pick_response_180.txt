The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are all about:
- Major scientific breakthroughs
- Involving large-scale, collaborative efforts or advanced technology
- Confirming fundamental theories or discovering new fundamental entities/phenomena
- Relatively recent discoveries (late 20th/early 21st century)

The anti-examples are also major scientific breakthroughs but are:
- More focused on understanding the building blocks of life or matter at a fundamental level (DNA, genome, X-rays)
- Generally earlier discoveries compared to the examples
- Often attributed to individual scientists or smaller teams

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Landmark discoveries in fundamental physics or cosmology in the late 20th or early 21st century, often involving large-scale collaborations and advanced technology.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **Invention of the telescope by Galileo in the 17th century:** This is a major scientific invention but is too early and not focused on fundamental physics in the same way as the examples.
2. **Detection of gravitational waves by LIGO in 2015:** This is a major discovery in fundamental physics, involves a large collaboration and advanced technology, and is recent.
3. **Discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928:** This is a major scientific discovery but is in biology/medicine, not fundamental physics or cosmology.
4. **Discovery of the neutron in 1932:** This is a discovery in fundamental physics but is earlier than the timeframe suggested by the examples.
5. **Discovery of radioactivity by Marie Curie in the late 19th century:** This is a discovery in fundamental physics but is significantly earlier.
6. **First successful cloning of a mammal, Dolly the sheep, in 1996:** This is a major scientific achievement but is in biology, not fundamental physics or cosmology.
7. **Discovery of the electron in 1897:** This is a discovery in fundamental physics but is much earlier.
8. **First moon landing in 1969:** This is a major technological achievement but is more about engineering and space exploration than a fundamental discovery in physics or cosmology.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
