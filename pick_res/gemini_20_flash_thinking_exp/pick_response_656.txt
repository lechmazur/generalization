The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then score the provided candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding scoring based on broader, related themes.

Examples:
- Darwin's theory of evolution
- Einstein's theory of relativity
- Maxwell's equations

Anti-examples:
- Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction
- Boyle's law
- Hooke's law

The examples seem to be fundamental, overarching theories that revolutionized their respective fields. They are not simply empirical observations or relationships, but rather frameworks that explain a wide range of phenomena. The anti-examples, while important, are more specific laws or principles within a field.

Based on this, the specific theme seems to be **fundamental, comprehensive scientific theories that significantly reshaped their respective fields of study.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Archimedes' principle:**  Describes buoyancy. Important but not a fundamental, field-reshaping theory.
2. **Newton's laws of motion:**  Fundamental and foundational to classical mechanics.
3. **Coulomb's law:** Describes the electrostatic force. Important but more specific than the examples.
4. **Ohm's law:** Describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. More specific.
5. **Mendel's laws of inheritance:** Fundamental to genetics, though perhaps less mathematically formulated than some other examples.
6. **Avogadro's law:** Relates volume and the number of molecules of a gas. More specific.
7. **Lavoisier's law of conservation of mass:** Fundamental to chemistry.
8. **Kepler's laws of planetary motion:** Describe planetary motion but are more descriptive than explanatory in the same way as the examples.

Now, I will assign scores based on this analysis, ensuring a granular and continuous scale.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
