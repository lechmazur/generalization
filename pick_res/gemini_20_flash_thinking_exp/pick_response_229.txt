The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Washi paper used for calligraphy", "Amatl bark paper codex", and "Papyrus scroll". These all point to writing surfaces made from plant fibers. The anti-examples are "Stone inscription", "Clay tablet", and "Parchment manuscript". These are writing surfaces but not made from plant fibers.

The specific theme is likely "writing surfaces made from plant fibers". The broader theme could be "writing surfaces" or "methods of recording information".
