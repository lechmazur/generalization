The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples (cell membrane, dialysis machine, kidney) all relate to selective separation or filtering of substances.

The anti-examples (turnstile, ventilation duct, revolving door) relate to controlling passage or flow, but not necessarily with a selective filtering aspect.

Therefore, the specific theme is **selective separation or filtering of substances**.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it performs selective separation or filtering, while being careful not to score based on general passage or flow control.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **drawbridge:** Primarily controls passage, not selective separation. Low score.
*   **pipeline:** Transports substances, but not necessarily with selective separation. Could have some filtering elements, but not its primary function. Moderate score.
*   **air filter:**  Specifically designed for selective separation of particles from air. High score.
*   **door:** Controls passage, not selective separation. Low score.
*   **window:** Allows light and sometimes air to pass, but not primarily for selective separation. Low score.
*   **canal:** Transports water, but not necessarily with selective separation. Moderate score.
*   **tunnel:** Allows passage, not selective separation. Low score.
*   **gate:** Controls passage, not selective separation. Low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
