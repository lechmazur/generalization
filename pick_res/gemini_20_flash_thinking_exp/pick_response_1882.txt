The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: Reconnaissance drone camera, Periscope, Spy satellite camera
Anti-examples: Spy camera pen, Spy plane, Laser microphone

The examples all involve visual observation from a remote or concealed location. The anti-examples introduce elements of concealment (pen), broader surveillance platforms (plane), and non-visual methods (microphone).

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **remote visual observation for surveillance or reconnaissance**.

Now, I need to score each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme:

1. Binoculars with night vision:  Allows visual observation, but not inherently remote or for surveillance in the same way as the examples. It's closer than the anti-examples, but not a perfect fit.
2. Radar system: Detects objects, but not visually. This aligns with the "broader theme" aspect.
3. Microphone:  Audio surveillance, not visual. Definitely a broader theme.
4. Submarine sonar:  Underwater detection using sound, not visual. Broader theme.
5. Wiretap:  Audio surveillance, not visual. Broader theme.
6. Listening device:  Audio surveillance, not visual. Broader theme.
7. Radio transmitter:  Sends signals, not involved in visual observation. Broader theme.
8. Stealth aircraft:  A platform, like the spy plane, but not inherently about visual observation. Broader theme.<number>1</number><score>5</score>
