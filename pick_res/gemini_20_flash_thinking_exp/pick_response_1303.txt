The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples (Lightning bolts, Snowflakes, Romanesco broccoli) share the characteristic of being naturally occurring, branching, and fractal-like in their structure.

The anti-examples (Crystal formations, Sunflower heads, Seashells) share the characteristic of being naturally occurring and patterned, but their patterns are more radial, geometric, or spiral rather than branching and fractal.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be naturally occurring branching fractal patterns.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

1. Coral reefs: Exhibit branching structures, but also other forms. Some fractal-like aspects.
2. Pine cones: Have a spiral arrangement of scales, less branching.
3. Stalactites: Form through deposition, more linear than branching.
4. Spider webs:  Branching structure, but artificial.
5. River deltas: Branching pattern, naturally occurring.
6. Mountain ranges:  Can have branching ridge lines, naturally occurring.
7. Rock formations: Very broad, some might have branching patterns, others not.
8. Cloud formations: Can exhibit branching patterns, naturally occurring.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
