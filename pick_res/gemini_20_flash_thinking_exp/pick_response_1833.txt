The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Aluminum-boron composite layers
- Water-filled double hull compartments
- Polyethylene shielding panels

Anti-examples:
- Nuclear power plant containment
- Particle accelerator shielding
- Radiation therapy room lining

The examples seem to relate to **lightweight, layered structures used for protection against external hazards**. The anti-examples, while also protective, are much more substantial and often involve shielding against high-energy radiation.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely **lightweight, layered shielding against physical impact or less energetic radiation**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of general radiation shielding.

Candidate evaluation:
1. Meteor impact barriers:  Fits the theme of layered protection against physical impact. Score: 8
2. Hydrogenated graphene sheets: Lightweight and can be used for shielding. Potentially against radiation, but also physical damage. Score: 7
3. Solar wind deflectors:  Could involve lightweight materials for deflecting particles. Score: 6
4. Heat shield tiles:  Focus is on heat, but they are layered and provide protection. Score: 5
5. Lead aprons:  Focus is on radiation shielding, heavier material. Doesn't fit the "lightweight" aspect. Score: 2
6. Atmospheric re-entry shields: Layered and for protection against heat and physical stress. Score: 7
7. Concrete bunker walls:  Heavy, not layered in the same way. Fits the broader theme of protection but not the specific one. Score: 1
8. X-ray protective glass: Primarily for radiation shielding, not lightweight. Score: 3<number>1</number><score>8</score>
