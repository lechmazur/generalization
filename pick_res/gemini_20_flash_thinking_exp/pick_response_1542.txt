The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are:
- basket weaving
- origami tessellations
- crochet lace

The anti-examples are:
- quilt
- patchwork
- macrame

From the examples, the core theme seems to be **creating intricate, often decorative, three-dimensional structures or patterns using a single continuous strand or material, or by folding a single sheet.**  The anti-examples involve joining separate pieces of material.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **mosaic art:** Involves assembling small pieces. Doesn't fit the continuous strand/single sheet idea.
2. **beadwork:** Involves stringing together individual beads. Doesn't fit the continuous strand/single sheet idea.
3. **tapestry:**  Woven, but typically involves multiple threads and a loom, not a single continuous strand like crochet or basket weaving.
4. **stained glass window:** Involves assembling separate pieces of glass. Doesn't fit the continuous strand/single sheet idea.
5. **embroidery:**  Uses thread, but involves stitching onto a base fabric, not creating a standalone structure.
6. **knitting:** Uses continuous yarn to create fabric through interlocking loops, similar to crochet.
7. **collage:** Involves assembling disparate elements. Doesn't fit the continuous strand/single sheet idea.
8. **chain mail armor:** Involves linking individual metal rings. Doesn't fit the continuous strand/single sheet idea.

Now, let's assign scores based on how closely they align with the specific theme:

- **basket weaving, origami tessellations, crochet lace:**  These involve a single continuous element (strips, paper, yarn) being manipulated to create a structure.

- **quilt, patchwork, macrame:** These involve joining separate pieces.

Considering the nuances:

- Knitting is close to crochet, using a continuous strand.
- Tapestry involves weaving, which is related but uses multiple strands.
- Beadwork and chain mail involve joining elements, but the elements are somewhat uniform and create a pattern.
- Mosaic, stained glass, and collage involve joining distinct, often varied, elements.
- Embroidery uses a continuous thread but on a base fabric.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
