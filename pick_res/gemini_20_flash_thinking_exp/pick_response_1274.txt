The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples. The core elements of the theme seem to be:
- Multiple interconnected narratives or perspectives.
- A unifying element that ties these narratives together (recurring motif, converging storylines, central event looping back).
- A sense of recursion or cyclical structure.

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is NOT:
- Isolated, standalone pieces with no connections.
- Lack of recurring elements or overarching structure.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10 based on how well it fits the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

1. **Unrelated quotes:**  Clearly doesn't fit the theme. No narrative, no connection.
2. **Recipe book:**  No narrative or cyclical structure.
3. **Single act of a play:**  Part of a larger narrative, but doesn't inherently demonstrate the cyclical or multi-perspective aspect.
4. **Film anthology with shared object:**  Multiple narratives connected by a recurring element. This seems like a strong match.
5. **Single scene from a movie:**  Part of a larger narrative, but lacks the multi-perspective or cyclical aspect on its own.
6. **Standalone comic strip:**  Isolated, no connections.
7. **Random facts:**  No narrative or connection.
8. **Single song:**  Isolated, no connections to a larger narrative.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
