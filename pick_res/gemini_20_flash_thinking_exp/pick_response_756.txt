The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples highlight individuals who survived extreme hardship in polar regions after being stranded or separated from their main expedition group. The anti-examples are also polar explorers but their inclusion suggests the specific theme is narrower than simply "polar exploration" or "famous polar explorers". The anti-examples seem to be individuals who led expeditions and while they faced challenges, their survival wasn't the central defining characteristic in the same way as the examples.

The specific theme seems to be about individuals who experienced prolonged survival situations in harsh polar environments *after* a significant event like being trapped, shipwrecked, or abandoned.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme:

*   **Ernest Shackleton:**  Famous for the Endurance expedition where his ship was crushed by ice. He and his crew endured a remarkable survival journey. This fits the specific theme very well.
*   **Douglas Mawson:**  Experienced a harrowing solo survival ordeal after his sled team fell into a crevasse. This aligns strongly with the specific theme.
*   **Robert Falcon Scott:**  Led the ill-fated expedition to the South Pole. While he faced extreme hardship, the focus is on the expedition's failure and death, not prolonged survival after a specific event.
*   **John Franklin:**  His expedition perished. This is the opposite of the survival theme.
*   **Knud Rasmussen:**  A prominent Arctic explorer and ethnographer. While he faced challenges, his story isn't primarily about a specific survival event.
*   **Roald Amundsen:**  Famous for being the first to reach the South Pole and navigating the Northwest Passage. His success is the focus, not a survival ordeal.
*   **Otto Sverdrup:**  A Norwegian sailor and Arctic explorer who participated in and led several expeditions. While he faced challenges, his story isn't primarily about a specific survival event.
*   **Ada Blackjack:**  Her story is a direct match to the specific theme. She survived alone for two years after the rest of her group perished.
