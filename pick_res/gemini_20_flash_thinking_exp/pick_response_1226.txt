The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and ensure the anti-examples are excluded.

Examples: plywood, lasagna, semiconductor chips
Anti-examples: stack of books, stack of papers, filing cabinet

The examples seem to share the characteristic of being composed of multiple layers or levels. Plywood has layers of wood, lasagna has layers of pasta, sauce, and cheese, and semiconductor chips have multiple layers of materials.

The anti-examples relate to stacking or containing items, which is a broader theme.

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the "multiple layers" theme, while excluding the "stacking/containing" theme.

1. storage boxes:  While they can be stacked, the core concept isn't about internal layers. Score: 2
2. deck of cards:  Composed of multiple cards. Score: 8
3. wedding cake:  Typically has multiple tiers or layers. Score: 9
4. sandwich:  Has multiple layers of bread and fillings. Score: 9
5. photo album:  Contains multiple pages, but the core concept isn't about the layers of the album itself. Score: 3
6. Earth's atmosphere:  Has distinct layers (troposphere, stratosphere, etc.). Score: 10
7. parking garage:  Has multiple levels for parking. Score: 7
8. tool chest:  Often has multiple trays or layers for organizing tools. Score: 6<number>1</number><score>2</score>
