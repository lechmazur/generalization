The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples are all valuable, ornate objects gifted between rulers of different countries in the past. The anti-examples are gifts or exchanges that are not valuable, ornate objects.

The task is to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match the specific theme, not a broader theme. I need to assign a score from 0 to 10 to each candidate.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll evaluate each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1: A trade agreement established between two countries.** This is an agreement, not a physical object. It doesn't fit the theme.
*   **Candidate 2: A royal marriage arranged between two ruling families.** This is an arrangement, not a physical object. It doesn't fit the theme.
*   **Candidate 3: A pair of falcons sent by the Sultan of Egypt to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1229.** This is a gift between rulers of different countries in the past. While not an ornate object, it's a valuable gift.
*   **Candidate 4: A portrait of a monarch.** This is a physical object and could be gifted between rulers.
*   **Candidate 5: A peace treaty signed between two nations.** This is an agreement, not a physical object.
*   **Candidate 6: Land ceded in a treaty.** This is a transfer of territory, not a physical object.
*   **Candidate 7: A letter of diplomatic correspondence.** This is a physical object and relates to diplomacy between countries.
*   **Candidate 8: Military support offered in times of war.** This is an action or agreement, not a physical object.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate, ensuring a granular and nuanced distribution across the 0-10 range.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>7</score>
<number>4</number><score>5</score>
<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>4</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
