The user has provided three examples of a specific theme: Keynesianism, Darwinism, and Freudianism. These are all **named bodies of thought or systems of ideas** associated with a particular individual or a core set of principles. They are often referred to with the "-ism" suffix.

The user has also provided three anti-examples: "a philosophical school", "a social movement", and "a philosophical concept". These are broader categories that the examples could potentially fall under, but the examples themselves are more specific than these general categories.

The task is to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme identified from the examples, but *not* the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples. The scoring should be on a scale of 0 to 10, and the output should follow a specific format.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **a psychological disorder**: This doesn't fit the pattern of a named body of thought or system of ideas. Score: Low.
2. **a mathematical theorem**: While theorems are named, they are specific statements within a field, not a broad system of thought. Score: Low.
3. **a scientific method**: This is a process, not a named body of thought. Score: Low.
4. **Marxism**: This is a named body of thought associated with Karl Marx, similar to the examples. Score: High.
5. **a legal principle**: This is a specific rule within a legal system, not a broad system of thought. Score: Low.
6. **a religious doctrine**: This is a set of beliefs within a religion, which can be considered a system of thought, though often more prescriptive than the examples. Score: Medium-High.
7. **a political party**: This is an organization, not a system of thought, although it might be based on one. Score: Low-Medium.
8. **a historical figure**: This is a person, not a system of thought, although the person might be associated with one. Score: Low.

Now, let's assign specific scores, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.

1. a psychological disorder:  Definitely not a match. Score: 1
2. a mathematical theorem:  Not a system of thought. Score: 2
3. a scientific method: A process, not a body of thought. Score: 1
4. Marxism: A clear match. Score: 9
5. a legal principle: Too specific, not a broad system. Score: 2
6. a religious doctrine:  A system of beliefs, but different in nature. Score: 6
7. a political party:  Related to ideologies, but not the ideology itself. Score: 3
8. a historical figure:  A person, not a system of thought. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>1</score>
