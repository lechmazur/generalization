The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the examples and anti-examples.

Examples focus on reducing noise or vibration in household appliances and vehicles.
Anti-examples are loud power tools.

The specific theme is about noise reduction features in devices that are typically expected to be somewhat noisy. It's not just about being quiet, but about actively reducing noise.

Now I need to score the candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of just "loud things".

1. **lawnmower:**  Lawnmowers are inherently loud. While some might have features to reduce noise *compared to other lawnmowers*, it's not a primary focus like in the examples. It's closer to the anti-examples.
2. **motorcycle:** Similar to a lawnmower, motorcycles are generally loud. Some might have quieter exhausts, but noise reduction isn't the primary design goal.
3. **power drill:**  Power drills are designed for power, not quietness. Similar to the anti-examples.
4. **helicopter:** Helicopters are extremely loud. Noise reduction is a challenge, not a core feature marketed to consumers.
5. **vacuum cleaner:** Vacuum cleaners are known for being noisy. Some have features to reduce noise, making them a better fit than the previous candidates.
6. **hairdryer:** Hairdryers are also noisy. Some might have features to reduce the pitch or intensity of the noise, but it's not a primary selling point in the same way as the examples.
7. **blender:** Blenders are designed to pulverize things, which inherently creates noise. Some might have features to dampen the sound, but it's not the primary focus.
8. **computer fan with noise-optimized blades:** This directly matches the theme of actively reducing noise in a device that typically makes noise.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
