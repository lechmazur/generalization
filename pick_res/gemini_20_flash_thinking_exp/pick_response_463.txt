The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "a curved pruning saw", "a shepherd's crook", and "a curved garden trowel". The anti-examples are "a utility knife", "a flathead screwdriver", and "a level".

From the examples, the specific theme seems to be tools with a curved or bent shape, often used for gardening or tending to plants/animals. The anti-examples are straight, non-curved tools, indicating that the curvature is a key aspect of the specific theme.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the "curved tool, potentially for gardening/tending" theme, while specifically avoiding the broader theme of "tools in general".

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

1. **a hammer**: Generally straight, used for striking. Doesn't fit the curved theme. Score: Low.
2. **a chisel**: Straight, used for cutting or shaping. Doesn't fit the curved theme. Score: Low.
3. **a crowbar**: Often has a slight curve or bend for leverage, but not the primary characteristic. Could be argued as somewhat curved. Score: Moderate.
4. **a saw blade**:  While a pruning saw is curved, a standalone saw blade is generally straight. Score: Low.
5. **a straight ruler**:  Definitely straight. Score: Very low.
6. **a stapler**:  Has some curves in its design, but not in the functional part that interacts with the material. Not related to gardening/tending. Score: Low.
7. **a bent-handle spoon**:  Clearly curved. While not a gardening tool, the curvature is a strong match. Score: High.
8. **a tape measure**:  The tape itself is flexible, but the device is generally boxy and not curved in the same way as the examples. Score: Low.

Now, let's assign specific scores within the 0-10 range, ensuring granularity.

1. **a hammer**:  Definitely not curved. Score: 1
2. **a chisel**:  Definitely not curved. Score: 0
3. **a crowbar**: Has a slight curve, but not the defining feature. Score: 4
4. **a saw blade**: Straight, unlike the curved pruning saw. Score: 2
5. **a straight ruler**:  Completely straight. Score: 0
6. **a stapler**:  Has some curves, but not in the functional part and not related to the theme. Score: 3
7. **a bent-handle spoon**:  Clearly curved. Score: 9
8. **a tape measure**:  Not curved in the relevant way. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>1</score>
