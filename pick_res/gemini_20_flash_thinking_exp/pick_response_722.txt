The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Seed to tree: Natural, biological growth and transformation.
- Coal to diamond: Natural, geological transformation under pressure.
- Caterpillar to butterfly: Natural, biological metamorphosis.

The specific theme seems to be **natural, intrinsic transformation involving a change in form and nature, often biological or geological, and typically irreversible.**

Anti-examples:
- Factory to museum: Artificial conversion, change of purpose.
- Book to movie: Adaptation, change of medium.
- Building renovation: Improvement, repair, not a fundamental change in nature.

The anti-examples involve human intervention and are more about alteration or adaptation than a fundamental, intrinsic transformation.

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme (natural, intrinsic transformation) and not the broader theme (any kind of change or transformation).

Candidate evaluation:
1. House being remodeled:  Human intervention, alteration, not intrinsic. Low score.
2. Website being redesigned: Human intervention, alteration, not intrinsic. Low score.
3. Tadpole metamorphosing into a frog: Natural, biological metamorphosis. High score.
4. Story being rewritten: Human intervention, alteration, not intrinsic. Low score.
5. Song being remixed: Human intervention, alteration, not intrinsic. Low score.
6. Law being amended: Human intervention, alteration, not intrinsic. Low score.
7. Company rebranding its logo: Human intervention, alteration, not intrinsic. Low score.
8. Garden being redesigned: Human intervention, alteration, not intrinsic. Low score.
