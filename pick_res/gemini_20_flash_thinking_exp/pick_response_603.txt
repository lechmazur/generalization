The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples highlight automated or semi-automated systems for handling delicate fruits, focusing on sorting, packaging, and gentle handling. Key features are automation, handling delicate produce, and often involving packaging or sorting.

The anti-examples are manual tools for processing fruits or related items. This helps to distinguish the specific theme from broader themes related to fruit processing.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "automated or semi-automated systems for handling and processing delicate fruits, often involving sorting or packaging".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of general fruit/food processing.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **Handheld nutcracker:**  Manual, not for delicate fruit. Score: Low.
*   **Handheld vegetable peeler:** Manual, not for fruit. Score: Low.
*   **Handheld herb grinder:** Manual, not for fruit. Score: Low.
*   **Manual cheese slicer:** Manual, not for fruit. Score: Low.
*   **High-speed wrapping device for protecting delicate peaches in foam nets:** Automated, handles delicate fruit, involves packaging. Score: High.
*   **Handheld garlic press:** Manual, not for fruit. Score: Low.
*   **Manual apple corer:** Manual, for fruit but not automated or involving packaging/sorting in the same way as the examples. Score: Low-Mid.
*   **Handheld citrus squeezer:** Manual, for fruit but not automated or involving packaging/sorting in the same way as the examples. Score: Low-Mid.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
