The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: Bow and arrow, crane, suspension bridge. These all involve tension and the transfer of force over a distance, often using cables or similar structures.

Anti-examples: Spring, lever, pulley. These are all simple machines that deal with force and motion, but they don't necessarily involve the same kind of large-scale, tension-based structure as the examples. They represent broader concepts of mechanical advantage and force manipulation.

Specific theme: Structures or devices that utilize tension, often involving cables or similar elements, to support weight or transfer force over a distance.

Now I need to score each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. Skyscraper:  Relies on a structural framework, often steel, which experiences tension and compression. While not explicitly using cables like a suspension bridge, the concept of load-bearing and internal forces aligns.
2. Magnet:  Deals with magnetic forces, not mechanical tension.
3. Gearbox:  Transmits rotational force through gears, a different mechanism than tension-based structures.
4. Seesaw:  A lever, explicitly listed as an anti-example.
5. Parachute: Relies on tension in the fabric and ropes to slow descent.
6. Hydraulic system: Uses fluid pressure, not tension in solid structures.
7. Dam:  Resists water pressure, relying on its mass and structural integrity, but not primarily on tension in cables or similar elements.
8. Guitar:  Uses tension in the strings to produce sound.<number>1</number><score>7</score>
