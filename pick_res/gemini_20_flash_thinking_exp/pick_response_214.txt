The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match the specific theme identified from the examples, while avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are all about **wooden containers used for aging specific alcoholic beverages**.

The anti-examples highlight that the theme is NOT about:
- Any container for alcoholic beverages (stainless steel, metal, glass)
- Any stage of production (fermenting, dispensing, storing)

Therefore, the specific theme is **wooden containers used for aging specific alcoholic beverages**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **a glass decanter for serving whiskey**:  Glass, not wood. Serving, not aging. Low score.
2. **a clay pot for fermenting mead**: Clay, not wood. Fermenting, not aging. Low score.
3. **a plastic container for holding vodka**: Plastic, not wood. Holding, not aging. Low score.
4. **a French oak vat for aging wine**: Wood (oak). Aging. Alcoholic beverage (wine). Good match.
5. **a ceramic jug for storing sake**: Ceramic, not wood. Storing, not aging. Low score.
6. **a bamboo vessel for serving soju**: Bamboo (wood-like, but not the same as the examples). Serving, not aging. Moderate score.
7. **a glass carboy for fermenting cider**: Glass, not wood. Fermenting, not aging. Low score.
8. **a copper still for distilling gin**: Copper, not wood. Distilling, not aging. Low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
