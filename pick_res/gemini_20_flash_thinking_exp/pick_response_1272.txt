The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: Cell membrane, turnstile, firewall
Anti-examples: Handcuffs, a prison, a lock

The specific theme seems to be about **selective barriers that control access or flow**. The anti-examples relate to confinement or restriction, which is broader.

Let's evaluate each candidate against the specific theme:

1. **A traffic light:** Controls the flow of traffic, allowing some to pass and others to stop. This fits the theme well.
2. **A speed limit:**  Controls the rate of flow, not necessarily access. It's a rule, not a physical barrier. Less of a direct fit.
3. **A wall:** A barrier, but not necessarily selective. It blocks everything. Closer to the anti-examples.
4. **A gate:** A selective barrier that can be opened or closed to control access. Fits the theme well.
5. **A fence:** A barrier, but generally less selective than a gate. More about defining boundaries.
6. **A budget:** Controls the flow of money. Metaphorical barrier. Less direct fit.
7. **A cage:**  A barrier, but primarily for confinement, like the anti-examples.
8. **A border:** A barrier that controls movement between regions. Can be selective.

Now, let's assign scores using the full range, considering nuance:

1. Traffic light:  Good control of flow, but not a physical barrier in the same way as the examples. 8
2. Speed limit: Controls flow, but not a physical barrier and more of a rule. 4
3. Wall: A barrier, but not selective. Closer to the anti-examples. 3
4. Gate: A selective barrier. Fits well. 9
5. Fence: A barrier, less selective than a gate. 6
6. Budget: Metaphorical control of flow. 5
7. Cage: Primarily for confinement, like the anti-examples. 2
8. Border: Controls movement, can be selective. 7<number>1</number><score>8</score>
