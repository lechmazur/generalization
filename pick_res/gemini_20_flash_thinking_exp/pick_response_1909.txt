The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples highlight systems that use real-time data to dynamically optimize operations. The anti-examples represent static or pre-programmed systems.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, using a scale of 0 to 10. The scoring needs to be nuanced and use the full range.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **a non-adaptive public transportation timetable**: This is similar to the anti-examples, being static. Score should be low.
2. **a manual resource allocation tool for project management**: This is also manual and not dynamic. Score should be low.
3. **a standard recommendation system for movies based on user history**: This uses past data, not real-time data for dynamic optimization. Score should be low to mid.
4. **a smart grid that dynamically balances electricity supply and demand using real-time consumption data**: This strongly matches the theme. Score should be high.
5. **a GPS navigation app that provides static route suggestions**: This is closer to the anti-examples, lacking real-time optimization. Score should be low.
6. **a static pricing model for an e-commerce platform**: This is clearly static. Score should be very low.
7. **a weather forecasting app that predicts rain based on historical data**: This uses historical data, not real-time data for dynamic optimization. Score should be low to mid.
8. **a basic thermostat with pre-set temperature schedules**: This is pre-programmed and not dynamically adjusting based on real-time data. Score should be low.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
