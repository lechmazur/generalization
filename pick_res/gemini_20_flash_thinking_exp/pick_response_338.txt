The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score new candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples:
- Chryselephantine (ivory and gold) sculptures of major Greek gods.

Anti-examples:
- Figurines/reliefs/carvings of Greek mythological figures or objects made from materials other than ivory and gold, or not explicitly described as chryselephantine.

Specific theme: Chryselephantine (ivory and gold) sculptures/statues/figurines of major Olympian Greek gods.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **A bronze and gold mixed Hephaestus statue**: Contains gold, but not ivory. Hephaestus is a major Greek god. Closer than the anti-examples, but not fully matching the specific theme.
2. **A painted wooden Ares statue**:  Wrong material (wood, not ivory/gold). Ares is a major Greek god.
3. **A terracotta Minotaur sculpture**: Wrong material (terracotta). Minotaur is a mythological creature, not a major Olympian god.
4. **A marble statue of Hermes**: Wrong material (marble). Hermes is a major Greek god.
5. **A bronze Greek warrior helmet**: Wrong material (bronze). Not a depiction of a god.
6. **A gold-adorned ivory carving of Athena in full battle armor**: Correct materials (ivory and gold). Athena is a major Greek god.
7. **A wooden carving of Medusa**: Wrong material (wood). Medusa is a mythological figure, not a major Olympian god.
8. **A ceramic Dionysus wine cup**: Wrong material (ceramic). While related to Dionysus, it's an object, not a statue/figurine of the god.

Now, let's assign scores based on the closeness to the specific theme:

- Full match (ivory and gold, major god): 10
- Partial match (gold but not ivory, major god): Higher than anti-examples, but not perfect.
- Wrong material, but major god: Lower than partial match.
- Wrong material, not a major god: Even lower.
- Wrong material, object not a god: Lowest.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
