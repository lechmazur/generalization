The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are:
- Lion of Babylon
- Great Sphinx of Giza
- Colossal Olmec Head 1

The anti-examples are:
- Egyptian obelisks
- Stonehenge trilithons
- Assyrian lamassu

Let's analyze the examples to identify the specific theme:
- All are large-scale sculptures.
- All are singular, monumental figures (or heads in the case of the Olmec).
- All are made of stone (or terracotta, which is fired clay, a type of ceramic).
- All are ancient.
- All represent a figure (animal, human, or composite).

Now let's analyze the anti-examples to understand what the specific theme *excludes*:
- Egyptian obelisks: Tall, four-sided, tapering monuments, not necessarily figurative sculptures.
- Stonehenge trilithons:  Arrangements of large stones, but not singular figurative sculptures.
- Assyrian lamassu:  Large, composite figures, but often part of architectural structures (guarding doorways) and not necessarily singular, isolated monuments in the same way as the examples.

The specific theme seems to be: **Large-scale, singular, monumental, ancient figurative sculptures.**

Now let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Terracotta Warriors:  Large-scale, ancient, figurative sculptures, but they are a *collection* of figures, not singular. Likely a lower score.
2. Persepolis reliefs: Ancient, figurative, but they are *reliefs* (attached to a surface), not freestanding sculptures, and often part of a larger narrative scene. Likely a lower score.
3. Khmer Buddha statues: Large-scale, ancient, figurative sculptures. Often singular and monumental. Likely a higher score.
4. Parthenon frieze: Ancient, figurative, but a *relief* and part of a larger architectural structure. Likely a lower score.
5. Moai at Rano Raraku: Large-scale, singular, monumental, ancient figurative sculptures. Strong match. Likely a high score.
6. Trajan's Column:  Tall, monumental, but primarily a narrative *relief* wrapped around a column, not a singular figurative sculpture. Likely a lower score.
7. Aztec Sun Stone: Large-scale, ancient, made of stone, but it's a circular disc with relief carvings, not a singular figurative sculpture in the same way as the examples. Likely a medium score.
8. Mayan stone reliefs: Ancient, figurative, but *reliefs* and often part of larger architectural structures. Likely a lower score.

Now, let's assign scores, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>2</score>
<number>3</number><score>8</score>
<number>4</number><score>1</score>
<number>5</number><score>9</score>
<number>6</number><score>4</score>
<number>7</number><score>6</score>
<number>8</number><score>3</score>
