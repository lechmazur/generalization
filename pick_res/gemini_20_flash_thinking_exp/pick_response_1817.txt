The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Software development lifecycle", "College admissions process", and "Clinical trial phases". These all represent a structured, sequential process with defined stages leading to a specific outcome.

The anti-examples are "Emergency response protocols", "Building security clearance", and "Weather warning levels". These represent procedures or classifications, but they are not necessarily sequential processes with a clear beginning and end in the same way as the examples.

The task is to evaluate candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader interpretation. I need to assess if each candidate represents a structured, sequential process with defined stages leading to a specific outcome.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll evaluate each candidate:

1. **Movie rating system:** This is a classification system, not a process. It assigns a category based on content. Low score.
2. **Military promotion system:** This involves a process with stages, requirements, and a defined outcome (promotion). Good match.
3. **Airport security checkpoints:** This is a procedure with steps, but it's more about filtering and control than a developmental process. Moderate score.
4. **Hotel star rating system:** This is a classification system based on amenities and quality. Low score.
5. **Tournament bracket system:** This is a structured process with stages leading to a winner. Good match.
6. **Credit score calculation:** This is a calculation based on various factors, not a sequential process with distinct phases. Moderate score.
7. **Restaurant kitchen hierarchy:** This is a structure of roles and responsibilities, not a sequential process. Low score.
8. **Academic grading scale:** This is a classification system based on performance. Low score.

Now I will assign scores, ensuring they are granular and use the full range.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>8</score>
<number>3</number><score>4</score>
<number>4</number><score>2</score>
<number>5</number><score>7</score>
<number>6</number><score>3</score>
<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>2</score>
