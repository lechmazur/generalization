The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are: Grace Hopper, Frances Allen, Barbara Liskov. These are all highly influential women in computer science, known for their pioneering work and significant contributions.

The anti-examples are: Fran Allen, Margaret Hamilton, Betty Holberton. These are also women in computing, but they differ in some way from the specific theme.

Let's analyze the differences:
- Fran Allen vs Frances Allen:  Likely a misspelling, but could indicate a focus on a specific area.
- Margaret Hamilton: Known for her work on the Apollo program software.
- Betty Holberton: One of the original programmers of the ENIAC.

The specific theme seems to be "pioneering women in computer science known for their contributions to programming languages, compilers, or theoretical foundations of computer science in the latter half of the 20th century". The anti-examples, while important figures, might fall outside this specific timeframe or focus.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Lynn Conway:  Pioneer in microchip design and VLSI. Strong match.
2. Kathleen Booth:  Developed assembly language and worked on early computers. Good match, but perhaps slightly earlier than the core examples.
3. Ada Lovelace:  Considered the first computer programmer, but significantly earlier. Doesn't fit the timeframe.
4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller:  Early computer science PhD recipient and advocate for computing education. Good match.
5. Jean Sammet: Developed the programming language FORMAC. Strong match.
6. Adele Goldberg:  Key figure in the development of Smalltalk and object-oriented programming. Strong match.
7. Mary Allen Wilkes:  Programmer on the LINC computer, developed the LAP6 operating system. Good match.
8. Radia Perlman:  Inventor of the Spanning Tree Protocol. Significant contribution to networking, which is related but not the core focus of the examples.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
