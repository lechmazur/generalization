The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score new candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples point towards naturally occurring, repeating patterns or structures that provide support or function. The anti-examples also show patterns but are different in nature. Termite mounds are built, snowflakes are crystalline structures, and butterfly wings have pigment patterns.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be naturally occurring, often interconnected, structural patterns that provide support or function within a living organism or natural system.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **a river delta**:  Shows a branching pattern, similar to leaf venation. It's a natural structure formed by flow. Seems like a decent match.
2. **a stalactite**:  A naturally occurring structure, but not necessarily a repeating pattern in the same way. It's more of a growth process.
3. **a geode**:  Has an internal crystalline structure, but the external shape is not necessarily patterned in the same way as the examples.
4. **a sunflower**:  The seed arrangement shows a spiral pattern, which is a natural, repeating structure.
5. **a pinecone**:  Has a spiral arrangement of scales, a clear repeating pattern.
6. **a coral reef**:  Composed of many interconnected polyps forming a complex structure, similar to honeycomb or spongy bone.
7. **a jellyfish**:  While having radial symmetry, it doesn't exhibit the same kind of interconnected structural pattern as the examples.
8. **cactus spines and water storage**:  Spines are modified leaves, and the water storage is a functional adaptation. The spines themselves might have some pattern in their arrangement.<number>1</number><score>7</score>
