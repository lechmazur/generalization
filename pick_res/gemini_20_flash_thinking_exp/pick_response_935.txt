The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples:
- The demolition of the Berlin Wall: A symbolic event marking the end of an era and the reunification of a divided entity.
- The Rosetta Stone: A key artifact that unlocked the understanding of a previously lost language and writing system.
- The printing of the Gutenberg Bible: A technological innovation that revolutionized the dissemination of information and knowledge.

Anti-examples:
- The French Revolution: A period of social and political upheaval.
- The Industrial Revolution: A period of major technological and socioeconomic change.
- The American Revolution: A war for independence and the establishment of a new nation.

The specific theme seems to be about **singular, pivotal events or discoveries that significantly altered the course of history by unlocking knowledge, enabling communication, or symbolizing a major shift in global order.**  The anti-examples represent broader, more protracted periods of change.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. The end of World War II: A major turning point, but a process rather than a singular event like the examples. It involved many events. Likely a moderate match.
2. The fall of the Roman Empire: A long process, not a singular event. Low match.
3. The signing of the Magna Carta: A specific document with lasting impact on rights and governance. A good match.
4. The Black Death: A devastating event with profound consequences, but not about unlocking knowledge or communication. Moderate match.
5. The launch of Sputnik: A singular event that marked the beginning of the space age and a technological breakthrough. A strong match.
6. The development of agriculture: A long process, not a singular event. Low match.
7. The Civil Rights Movement: A protracted social and political movement. Low match.
8. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand: A singular event that triggered a major conflict, but not about knowledge or communication in the same way as the examples. Moderate match.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
