The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are "Magnetic compass", "Kamal", and "Portolan charts". These all relate to navigation *before* precise timekeeping was readily available at sea. The anti-examples are "Chronometer", "Marine chronometer", and "Sextant". These all rely on accurate timekeeping for determining longitude. Therefore, the specific theme is likely pre-chronometer navigation tools, primarily focused on determining direction and location using celestial bodies or magnetic fields, without relying on precise time measurement for longitude.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

1. **Quadrant:** Used for measuring angles, particularly the altitude of celestial bodies. Pre-chronometer. Good match.
2. **Mercator projection maps:** A type of map projection. While useful for navigation, it's not a *tool* in the same way as the examples. It's a representation *using* information gathered by the tools. Moderate match.
3. **Astrolabe:** Used for measuring the altitude of celestial bodies and other calculations. Pre-chronometer. Good match.
4. **Sonar:** Uses sound waves to detect objects underwater. Modern technology, not related to the specific theme. Poor match.
5. **Gyroscopic compass:** A compass that uses a spinning rotor to find true north. While a compass, it's a more modern development and not directly in the same historical context as the examples. Moderate match.
6. **Echo sounder:** Uses sound waves to measure the depth of water. Modern technology, not related to the specific theme. Poor match.
7. **Cross-staff:**  A simple instrument used to measure angles, particularly the altitude of celestial bodies. Pre-chronometer. Good match.
8. **Inertial navigation system:** A navigation system that uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to track movement. Modern technology, not related to the specific theme. Poor match.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
