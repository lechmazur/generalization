The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples point towards *secret communication systems embedded within everyday objects or practices*. The anti-examples are more direct forms of secret communication.

I need to evaluate each candidate against the specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10. I need to avoid scoring based on broader themes of secret communication.

Here's my thought process for each candidate:

*   **Dead drop location:**  While related to secret communication, it's the *place*, not the *system* itself. It facilitates secret communication but isn't the method. Lower score.
*   **Code book:** This is a direct tool for encoding and decoding. It aligns with the *purpose* of secret communication but lacks the embedded nature of the examples. Lower score.
*   **Radio transmitter:**  A direct method of sending secret messages, but not embedded in an everyday object. Lower score.
*   **Cipher wheel:** A tool for encoding and decoding, similar to a code book. Lacks the embedded nature. Lower score.
*   **Treasure map:**  Contains coded information embedded within a map, which is an everyday object. Stronger connection to the theme. Higher score.
*   **Decoder ring:** A tool for decoding, but not embedded in an everyday object in the same way as the examples. Lower score.
*   **Carrier pigeon:**  Uses a living being as a method of secret communication. While not an *object*, it's an everyday element used for a specific purpose. Moderate score.
*   **Quilt pattern used on the Underground Railroad:**  Information embedded within a seemingly ordinary object (a quilt). Strong match to the theme. Higher score.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
