The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

The examples focus on *historical methods of celestial navigation or prediction*. They involve specific ancient cultures and their techniques.

The anti-examples focus on *modern or general applications of astronomy*. They use current technology and are not tied to specific historical methods.

Therefore, the specific theme is: **Digital tools that simulate or replicate historical methods of celestial navigation or prediction used by specific ancient cultures.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes.

Candidate 1: Simulates movement of stars and planets for education. This is general and not tied to a specific historical method. Score: 3
Candidate 2: Recreates the night sky as seen by ancient Egyptian priests for astrological purposes. This directly matches the theme. Score: 9
Candidate 3: Provides real-time satellite imagery. This is modern technology and not related to historical methods. Score: 0
Candidate 4: Modern GPS navigation system. This is modern technology and not related to historical methods. Score: 0
Candidate 5: Mapping constellations visible from different parts of the world. This is general and not tied to a specific historical method. Score: 2
Candidate 6: Calculates the position of planets for astronomical research. This is modern and not tied to a specific historical method. Score: 1
Candidate 7: Allows users to explore the solar system. This is general and not tied to a specific historical method. Score: 1
Candidate 8: Tracking the phases of the moon for planning purposes. While related to ancient practices, it's not tied to a specific culture's method of navigation or prediction based on celestial observations. Score: 4<number>1</number><score>3</score>
