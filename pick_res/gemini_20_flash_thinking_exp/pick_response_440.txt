The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples:
- Himalayan salt lamp:  Combines a geographical region with a natural product.
- Alaskan king crab: Combines a geographical region with a natural product (animal).
- Chesapeake Bay Retriever: Combines a geographical region with a natural product (animal breed).

Specific Theme:  Something named after a specific geographical location that is a natural product or derived from a natural product of that location.

Anti-examples:
- Long Island iced tea:  Geographical location + manufactured product (drink).
- Black Forest cake: Geographical location + manufactured product (food).
- Rocky Mountain spotted fever: Geographical location + disease.

The anti-examples highlight that the theme is *not* just about geographical locations. It's about natural products or things directly derived from them.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Great Barrier Reef snorkeling gear:  Geographical location + manufactured product. This is similar to the anti-examples.
2. Manhattan clam chowder: Geographical location + manufactured product (food). Similar to anti-examples.
3. Swiss Alps ski resort: Geographical location + man-made structure/service.
4. Andes Mountains trekking poles: Geographical location + manufactured product.
5. Napa Valley wine (from Napa Valley, California): Geographical location + natural product (grapes) -> manufactured product (wine). This is close to the theme.
6. Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort: Geographical location + man-made structure/service.
7. Mount Everest climbing boots: Geographical location + manufactured product.
8. Darjeeling tea (from Darjeeling, India): Geographical location + natural product (tea leaves) -> manufactured product (tea). This is close to the theme.

Based on this analysis, candidates 5 and 8 seem to be the closest matches.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
