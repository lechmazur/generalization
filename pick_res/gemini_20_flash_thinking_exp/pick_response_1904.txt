The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are:
- a yarrow stalk used in I Ching
- a crystal ball
- a set of rune stones

These examples suggest a theme of **physical objects used for divination that are manipulated or interpreted directly**.

The anti-examples are:
- a Ouija board
- a tea leaf reading cup
- a scrying mirror

These anti-examples, while related to divination, involve:
- **Ouija board:**  Communication with spirits, often involving multiple participants and indirect interpretation of movement.
- **Tea leaf reading cup:** Interpretation of patterns in residue, less about direct manipulation of an object.
- **Scrying mirror:**  Focusing on a reflective surface to induce visions, less about manipulating a physical object.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **physical objects directly manipulated or cast for divination, where the interpretation is based on the object's final state or configuration**.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **a astrology ephemeris:** This is a chart of celestial positions. It's not a physical object manipulated for divination. It's a reference tool. Likely a low score.
2. **a divining rod:** This is a physical object (often forked stick or bent wires) manipulated to find water or other things. The movement of the rod is the key. Seems like a good match.
3. **a pendulum:** A weighted object suspended from a string or chain, used for dowsing or answering questions. The swing or direction of the pendulum is interpreted. Seems like a good match.
4. **a geomancy sand tray:** Sand is cast or sprinkled, and the resulting patterns are interpreted. This involves direct manipulation of a physical substance. Seems like a good match.
5. **a deck of tarot cards:** Cards are shuffled and laid out, and their positions and combinations are interpreted. This involves direct manipulation of physical objects. Seems like a good match.
6. **a palmistry manual:** This is a book explaining how to interpret the lines on a hand. It's not a physical object used in the divination process itself. Likely a low score.
7. **a horoscope chart:** Similar to an ephemeris, it's a representation of astrological positions, not a physical object manipulated for divination. Likely a low score.
8. **a numerology chart:**  A chart based on numbers and their supposed significance. Not a physical object manipulated for divination. Likely a low score.

Let's refine the scores based on the nuances:

- Divining rod and pendulum are very direct manipulation.
- Tarot cards and geomancy involve manipulation and interpretation of patterns.
- Ephemeris, palmistry manual, horoscope chart, and numerology chart are reference materials or interpretations based on pre-existing data, not direct manipulation of objects.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
