The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples. The examples showcase devices that automatically adjust their settings based on user behavior and preferences. The anti-examples are manual devices that require user input for adjustments.

Therefore, the specific theme is **smart devices that automatically adjust their settings based on user behavior and preferences.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, using a scale of 0 to 10.

Candidate 1: A simple heater with a dial that users must set manually. - This is similar to the anti-examples.
Candidate 2: A non-smart speaker that does not adjust sound based on user preferences. - This is similar to the anti-examples.
Candidate 3: A standard air purifier with fixed settings that users must change manually. - This is similar to the anti-examples.
Candidate 4: A standard light switch that does not adjust lighting based on user preferences. - This is similar to the anti-examples.
Candidate 5: A traditional humidifier that users must adjust manually. - This is similar to the anti-examples.
Candidate 6: A manual window blind that users must adjust themselves. - This is similar to the anti-examples.
Candidate 7: An intelligent lighting system that adapts the light intensity and color temperature according to the user's mood and time of day. - This is very similar to the examples.
Candidate 8: A remote-controlled ceiling fan that users must adjust manually. - This is similar to the anti-examples, although it has a remote, it still requires manual adjustment.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
