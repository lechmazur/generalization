The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples involve temporary marks left by an action, while the anti-examples involve permanent marks or effects. The task is to score candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme (temporary marks) and not the broader theme (any kind of mark or effect).

Let's analyze each candidate:
1. **A permanent statue in a public park:** This is permanent, like the anti-examples.
2. **The contrails left by an airplane in the sky after it has passed:** These are temporary and disappear, like the examples.
3. **A permanent graffiti artwork on a wall:** This is permanent, like the anti-examples.
4. **The sound of thunder after a lightning strike:** The sound is temporary, like the examples, but it's an auditory effect, not a visual mark.
5. **A permanent memorial plaque on a building:** This is permanent, like the anti-examples.
6. **A permanent engraving on a piece of jewelry:** This is permanent, like the anti-examples.
7. **A permanent monument commemorating an event:** This is permanent, like the anti-examples.
8. **A permanent mural painted on a city wall:** This is permanent, like the anti-examples.

Based on this analysis, candidates 2 and 4 seem to fit the specific theme better than the others. Candidate 2 is a direct visual mark that fades, similar to the examples. Candidate 4 is a temporary effect following an event, but it's auditory, not visual. The rest are permanent, aligning with the anti-examples.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.

- Candidate 2 is the closest match.
- Candidate 4 is a decent match but not a visual mark.
- The rest are permanent and thus poor matches.

Let's refine the scoring:
- Candidate 2: High score (8 or 9)
- Candidate 4: Moderate score (6 or 7)
- The rest: Low scores (1, 2, or 3)

Considering the nuances:
- Contrails are very similar to footprints in terms of temporality and being a visual trace of movement.
- Thunder is a temporary effect but not a visual mark.
- The permanent items are clearly against the specific theme.

Final scoring plan:
- Candidate 2: 9
- Candidate 4: 6
- Candidates 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8:  Need to differentiate slightly based on how directly they relate to the idea of a 'mark'. Statues, plaques, and monuments are more like deliberate permanent installations. Graffiti and murals are more like permanent 'marks' left on a surface. Engravings are also permanent marks.

Revised scoring:
- Candidate 2: 9
- Candidate 4: 6
- Candidate 3: 2 (permanent mark)
- Candidate 8: 2 (permanent mark)
- Candidate 6: 1 (permanent mark)
- Candidate 1: 1 (permanent object)
- Candidate 5: 1 (permanent object)
- Candidate 7: 1 (permanent object)<number>1</number><score>1</score>
