The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Unusual stones or pebbles", "Bird feathers", and "Sea glass". The anti-examples are "Diamonds", "Gold nuggets", and "Ivory". The task is to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The specific theme seems to be about naturally occurring, often collected, relatively low-value items found in nature. The anti-examples are valuable, often mined or harvested, and traded for their monetary worth.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Fossil fuels:**  Naturally occurring, but not typically collected for aesthetic reasons. More of a resource. Doesn't fit the "collected" aspect strongly.
2. **Coins:** Man-made, have monetary value. Clearly an anti-example.
3. **Quartz crystals (some are valuable):** Naturally occurring, can be collected. The "some are valuable" aspect makes it lean towards the anti-examples, but the base material fits the examples.
4. **Timber:**  Naturally occurring, but harvested for value. More like the anti-examples.
5. **Seashells (commonly collected, but some have monetary value):** Naturally occurring, commonly collected. The "some have monetary value" is a slight deviation, but the core fits the examples.
6. **Iron ore:** Naturally occurring, but primarily a resource, not collected for its own sake.
7. **Driftwood:** Naturally occurring, often collected for aesthetic purposes. Fits the examples well.
8. **Amber (some contains valuable inclusions):** Naturally occurring, often collected. The "valuable inclusions" aspect pushes it towards the anti-examples, but the base material fits.

Now, let's assign scores based on this analysis, ensuring a granular and continuous scale.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
