The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "hansom cab", "surrey", and "phaeton". These are all types of horse-drawn carriages. The anti-examples are "chariot", "Roman quadriga", and "ox cart". These are also wheeled vehicles, but they differ in key aspects from the examples. Chariots and quadrigas are ancient and often associated with warfare or racing, while ox carts are typically for hauling heavy loads and are slower.

The specific theme seems to be "light, horse-drawn carriages for transporting people". The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*: ancient vehicles, vehicles pulled by animals other than horses, or vehicles primarily for cargo.

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding the broader themes.

1. **hay wagon**: Primarily for hauling hay, not people. Likely pulled by horses, but the primary function is wrong.
2. **covered wagon**: Used for long-distance travel and often for carrying goods and people, but not the same as the light carriages in the examples.
3. **sedan chair**: Carried by people, not horses.
4. **stagecoach**: A larger, public horse-drawn vehicle for longer distances, but still fits the "horse-drawn carriage for transporting people" aspect.
5. **palanquin**: Similar to a sedan chair, carried by people.
6. **dog sled**: Pulled by dogs, not horses.
7. **rickshaw**: Typically pulled by a person, though some are bicycle-powered.
8. **horse trailer**: Used to transport horses, not people.
