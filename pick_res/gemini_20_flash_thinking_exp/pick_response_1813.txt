The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the examples and anti-examples and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all about animal shelters/houses made from reclaimed/discarded materials.
The anti-examples are about other pet items made from recycled materials.

Therefore, the specific theme is "animal shelters/houses made from reclaimed/discarded materials". The broader theme is "pet items made from recycled materials".

I need to score each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme, avoiding being misled by the broader theme.

Candidate 1: A dog collar made from recycled rubber -  This is a pet item made from recycled material, but not a shelter/house. Low score.
Candidate 2: A fish tank made from recycled glass - This is a shelter/house for a pet made from recycled material. High score.
