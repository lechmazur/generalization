The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are Vionnet bias cut, Poiret belly-dancer silhouette, and Fortuny pleats. These all relate to specific and innovative techniques in early 20th-century high fashion. The anti-examples are Flapper dresses, Cloche hat, and Cubism. These are related to the same era but represent broader trends or artistic movements rather than specific techniques.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they match the *specific* theme, not just the broader context. I need to consider if each candidate is a specific, innovative technique or style within early 20th-century high fashion, similar to the examples.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll evaluate each candidate:

*   **Art Deco architecture:** While related to the era, it's not a specific fashion technique. Low score.
*   **Rayon:** This is a material. While used in fashion of the era, it's not a specific design technique like the examples. Moderate score.
*   **Little black dress:**  A style of dress, but more general than the specific techniques of the examples. Moderate score.
*   **Surrealism:** An artistic and literary movement, not a specific fashion technique. Low score.
*   **Chanel suit:** A specific style of garment, but perhaps less about a groundbreaking technique than the examples. Moderate score.
*   **Ready-to-wear clothing:** A broader concept of clothing production, not a specific design technique. Low score.
*   **Bakelite jewelry:** A type of material used for accessories. While fashionable in the era, it's not a specific design technique for clothing. Moderate score.
*   **Nylon:** A synthetic material, similar to rayon. Moderate score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
