The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Heat sealer", "Hot glue gun", and "Plastic welding gun". The anti-examples are "Welding torch", "Stapler", and "Rivet gun".

The core theme seems to be about joining materials, specifically plastics or similar materials, using heat to melt and fuse them together. The anti-examples highlight that the theme is not just about joining materials in general (welding torch, stapler, rivet gun), even if heat is involved in some cases (welding torch).

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme of joining materials by melting them with heat, as opposed to broader themes of joining materials in general.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

1. **Pressure-sensitive adhesive:** This joins materials through adhesion, not heat. It's a broader method of joining.
2. **Super glue:** This joins materials through chemical bonding, not heat. It's a broader method of joining.
3. **Epoxy resin:** This joins materials through chemical bonding and curing, not direct heat melting. It's a broader method of joining.
4. **Soldering iron:** This uses heat to melt solder, which then joins metal components. While it uses heat, it's for joining metals, not plastics directly. It's closer than adhesives but not the exact theme.
5. **Wood glue:** This joins wood through adhesion, not heat. It's a broader method of joining.
6. **Nail gun:** This joins materials mechanically using nails. It's a broader method of joining.
7. **Mechanical fastener:** This is a general term for joining materials mechanically (e.g., screws, bolts). It's a broader method of joining.
8. **Seamless tape:** This joins materials through adhesion, similar to pressure-sensitive adhesive. It's a broader method of joining.

Now, I will assign scores based on how closely each candidate aligns with the specific theme.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
