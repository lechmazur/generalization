The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they match *only* the specific theme, not broader related themes.

The examples are:
- Victorian pewter candlestick holder
- decorative lead garden statue from Versailles
- 18th century pewter serving platter

The anti-examples are:
- silver Georgian tea service
- sterling silver cutlery
- silver jewelry box

The specific theme seems to be "decorative or functional objects made of non-precious metals (pewter, lead) from a historical period (Victorian, 18th century, Versailles)". The anti-examples highlight that the material is key (not silver).

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme:

1. brass door knocker: Brass is a non-precious metal, and door knockers can be decorative. Could be from a historical period.
2. brass candlestick: Brass is a non-precious metal, and candlesticks are in the examples. Could be from a historical period.
3. gold snuff box: Gold is a precious metal, so it doesn't fit the material.
4. cast iron cooking pot: Cast iron is a non-precious metal. Cooking pots are functional. Could be from a historical period.
5. pewter tankard from colonial America: Pewter matches the material, and it's from a historical period.
6. copper cooking pan: Copper is a non-precious metal. Cooking pans are functional. Could be from a historical period.
7. copper weathervane: Copper is a non-precious metal. Weathervanes can be decorative. Could be from a historical period.
8. bronze door handle: Bronze is a non-precious metal, and door handles are functional. Could be from a historical period.

Now I need to assign scores from 0 to 10 based on how well they match the *specific* theme.

- Pewter is a strong indicator.
- Lead is present in one example.
- The historical aspect is important.
- Decorative or functional objects.

Let's assign scores:
1. brass door knocker: Brass is similar to pewter in that it's a non-precious metal. Door knockers can be decorative and are often from historical periods. A good match, but not as strong as pewter.
2. brass candlestick:  Similar to the examples in function and material.
3. gold snuff box: The material is wrong.
4. cast iron cooking pot:  Matches the non-precious metal aspect and can be from a historical period, but less decorative than some examples.
5. pewter tankard from colonial America:  Matches the material and historical period perfectly.
6. copper cooking pan: Matches the non-precious metal aspect and can be from a historical period, but less decorative than some examples.
7. copper weathervane: Matches the non-precious metal aspect and can be decorative and from a historical period.
8. bronze door handle: Matches the non-precious metal aspect and can be from a historical period.<number>1</number><score>7</score>
