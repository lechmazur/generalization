The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "a jigsaw puzzle", "a wishbone", and "a piñata". The anti-examples are "a mosaic", "a collage", and "a quilt".

The examples share the characteristic of being something that is meant to be broken apart or separated into pieces. A jigsaw puzzle is assembled from pieces and then can be taken apart. A wishbone is broken into two pieces. A piñata is broken to release its contents.

The anti-examples share the characteristic of being composed of smaller pieces joined together to form a whole, but they are not meant to be broken apart in the same way as the examples.

The task is to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of "something meant to be broken apart" and not the broader theme of "something composed of smaller pieces".

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **a stained glass window**:  While made of pieces, it's not meant to be broken. Score: 2
2. **a tapestry**: Woven together, not meant to be broken. Score: 1
3. **a fractal pattern**:  A mathematical concept, not physically broken. Score: 0
4. **a constellation**:  A grouping of stars, not physically broken. Score: 0
5. **a patchwork blanket**: Similar to a quilt, made of pieces joined together, not meant to be broken. Score: 1
6. **a mural**: Painted on a surface, not meant to be broken. Score: 0
7. **a kaleidoscope**:  Composed of pieces, but the purpose isn't to break it. However, the image it creates is fleeting and changes, which has a slight similarity to the breaking apart idea. Score: 3
8. **a sand mandala**:  Intentionally created and then destroyed. This fits the theme well. Score: 9<number>1</number><score>2</score>
