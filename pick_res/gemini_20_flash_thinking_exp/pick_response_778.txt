The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples point towards *indigenous technologies for survival in harsh environments*. The anti-examples are modern equivalents of survival gear. The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the *specific* theme, not just a broader theme of survival.

Let's analyze each candidate:

*   **a waterproof backpack:** While useful for survival, it's a relatively modern invention and doesn't fit the "indigenous technologies" aspect.
*   **a camping tent:**  Tents have existed for a long time, but the *specific* theme leans towards more rudimentary, resource-constrained solutions.
*   **a compass:**  A compass is a tool for navigation, but it's not directly related to the specific examples of shelter, cooking, or eye protection.
*   **a dehydrated meal pack:** This is a modern convenience, far from the indigenous methods of food preparation.
*   **a synthetic thermal blanket:**  Definitely modern, contrasting with the natural materials in the examples.
*   **a GPS navigation device:**  Highly modern technology, the opposite of the specific theme.
*   **use of animal hides for insulation:** This directly aligns with the use of natural materials for survival, similar to the bone goggles and igloo construction.
*   **a survival knife:** While knives have existed for a long time, the term "survival knife" often implies a modern, manufactured tool. However, basic knives made from stone or bone would fit the theme.

Now, let's assign scores, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.

*   Waterproof backpack: Low score, as it's modern. Maybe a 2 or 3.
*   Camping tent:  Slightly better than a backpack, as simpler versions existed historically. Maybe a 4 or 5.
*   Compass:  Useful for survival, but not directly related to the examples. Maybe a 3 or 4.
*   Dehydrated meal pack:  Definitely modern. A 1 or 2.
*   Synthetic thermal blanket:  Clearly modern. A 1 or 2.
*   GPS navigation device:  Very modern. A 0 or 1.
*   Use of animal hides:  Strong match to the theme. An 8 or 9.
*   Survival knife:  Could be interpreted as modern, but basic knives fit the theme. Maybe a 5 or 6.

Let's refine the scores to ensure a good spread.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
