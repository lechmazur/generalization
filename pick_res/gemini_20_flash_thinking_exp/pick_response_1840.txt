The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are all drinking vessels made from natural materials. The anti-examples are drinking vessels made from more refined materials. Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "drinking vessels made from natural, unprocessed materials". I need to score the candidates based on this theme, avoiding the broader theme of "drinking vessels".

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:
- **Metal flask:** Metal is not a natural, unprocessed material. It requires significant processing. Low score.
- **Ceramic mug:** Ceramic is made from clay, a natural material, but it's processed and fired. Medium-low score.
- **Plastic water bottle:** Plastic is synthetic and highly processed. Low score.
- **Enamel cup:** Enamel is a coating applied to metal. Neither is a natural, unprocessed material. Low score.
- **Clay pot:** Clay is a natural material, and a pot can be used for drinking. High score.
- **Stainless steel thermos:** Stainless steel is highly processed. Low score.
- **Copper mug:** Copper is a natural metal but requires processing. Medium-low score.
- **Bamboo tumbler:** Bamboo is a natural material. High score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
