The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit a specific theme, as exemplified by the provided examples and contrasted with the anti-examples.

The specific theme seems to be: **a building that has changed its primary religious purpose over time.**

The anti-examples highlight that simply changing function (e.g., palace to museum) is not the specific theme.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether it has transitioned between different religious uses.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

1. **Eiffel Tower:** Temporary structure to landmark - no religious aspect.
2. **Leaning Tower of Pisa:** Bell tower to tourist attraction - religious to secular, but not a change in *religious* purpose.
3. **Great Wall of China:** Fortification to tourist attraction - secular to secular.
4. **Pantheon:** Roman temple to Catholic church - **direct match to the specific theme.**
5. **Parthenon:** Temple to ruin - religious to secular, but not a change in *religious* purpose.
6. **Colosseum:** Amphitheater to tourist attraction - secular to secular.
7. **Kremlin:** Fortress to seat of government - secular to secular.
8. **Palace of Versailles:** Royal residence to museum - secular to secular.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores.<number>1</number><score>0</score>
