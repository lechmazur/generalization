The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples and then score new candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples all depict a single woman viewed from the front (or close to it) looking out of a window, painted around 1880 by Impressionist artists.

The anti-examples are designed to be misleading by sharing some elements but not all. They involve a single figure looking out of something, but the viewpoint is different (side, back) or the object of attention is different (mirror).

Therefore, the specific theme is: **A single woman viewed from the front (or close to it) looking out of a window, painted around 1880 by an Impressionist artist.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, considering all aspects: single woman, frontal view, looking out a window, and the approximate time period/artistic movement.

Candidate 1: Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1900 -  Matches 'single figure', 'looking out a window', but not 'frontal view' or the specific time period/movement.
Candidate 2: Single figure viewed from behind looking at a garden, painted in 1880 - Matches 'single figure', 'painted in 1880', but not 'frontal view' or 'looking out a window'.
Candidate 3: Single figure viewed from behind looking at a painting, painted in 1880 - Matches 'single figure', 'painted in 1880', but not 'frontal view' or 'looking out a window'.
Candidate 4: Single figure viewed from behind looking out a window, painted in 1910 - Matches 'single figure', 'looking out a window', but not 'frontal view' or the specific time period/movement.
Candidate 5: Figure at a Window by Edgar Degas (1876) - Matches 'figure at a window', 'painted around 1880'. Needs to be evaluated if the figure is a woman and if the view is frontal. Assuming it is a woman and the view is close to frontal, this is a strong match.
Candidate 6: Single figure viewed from behind looking at a door, painted in 1880 - Matches 'single figure', 'painted in 1880', but not 'frontal view' or 'looking out a window'.
Candidate 7: Painting of a group of people at a window from the 1880s - Matches 'at a window', 'from the 1880s', but not 'single figure'.
Candidate 8: Single figure viewed from behind looking at a balcony, painted in 1880 - Matches 'single figure', 'painted in 1880', but not 'frontal view' or 'looking out a window'.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
