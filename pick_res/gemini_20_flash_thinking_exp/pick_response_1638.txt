The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are New York Point, Moon type, and Boston Line Type. These are all tactile reading and writing systems for the visually impaired. The anti-examples are Morse code, Semaphore, and Semaphore flags. These are all visual or auditory communication systems, but not tactile reading/writing systems for the visually impaired.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they match the specific theme, which is tactile reading and writing systems for the visually impaired. I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10, ensuring the scores are granular and use the full range.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Finger spelling:**  While it involves hand movements, it's primarily a visual form of communication (or tactile if done hand-on-hand, but not a reading/writing system in the same way as the examples). Likely a low score.
*   **Unified English Braille:** This is a modern form of Braille, directly related to the examples. Likely a high score.
*   **SignWriting:** This is a visual system for writing sign languages. Not tactile. Likely a low score.
*   **American Braille:**  An older form of Braille, directly related to the examples. Likely a high score, though perhaps slightly lower than Unified English Braille due to being less current.
*   **Braille:** This is the general term for tactile reading and writing systems for the visually impaired, encompassing the examples. Likely a very high score.
*   **Sign language:** This is a visual (or tactile, but not reading/writing) form of communication. Likely a low score.
*   **Haptic communication:** This is a broader term for communication through touch. While the examples fall under this, it's too broad and includes things outside the specific theme. Likely a moderate score.
*   **Shorthand:** This is a system for rapid writing, typically visual. Not tactile or specifically for the visually impaired. Likely a low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
