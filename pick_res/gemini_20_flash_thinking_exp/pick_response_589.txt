The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- A cardboard toilet paper tube
- An empty Altoids tin lying on the sidewalk
- A crumpled plastic Easter egg found in the grass weeks after the holiday

The anti-examples are:
- An empty bottle of wine
- An empty coffee cup
- A discarded envelope

The examples suggest the theme of **discarded, relatively small, lightweight, and often somewhat flimsy containers or wrappers that once held a consumable product or were associated with a transient event/purpose.**  They are all clearly trash or discarded items.

The anti-examples, while also discarded, are generally more substantial (bottle, cup) or represent communication/transaction (envelope). They are less about the remnants of a consumed item and more about the vessel itself or a communication act.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **An empty picture frame:**  While discarded, it's not typically associated with a consumed product. It's more of a durable good. Score: 2
2. **A used tea bag:** This is a direct remnant of a consumed product and is clearly discarded. Score: 9
3. **A discarded blister pack for allergy medication:** This is a container for a consumable product and is clearly discarded. Score: 10
4. **A rusty tin can:** This is a container for a consumable product and is clearly discarded. Score: 8
5. **A discarded candy wrapper:** This is a wrapper for a consumable product and is clearly discarded. Score: 10
6. **A cracked eggshell:** This is the remnant of a consumed product. Score: 9
7. **An empty bird's nest:** This is a natural structure, not a manufactured container for a consumable product. It's discarded in the sense that it's no longer in use, but it doesn't fit the "container" aspect. Score: 1
8. **An empty wallet:** While discarded, it's not a container for a consumable product. It's more of a personal item. Score: 3<number>1</number><score>2</score>
