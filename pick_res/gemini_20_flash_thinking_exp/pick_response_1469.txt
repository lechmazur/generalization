The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples all involve the use of scent marking by animals to define territory. The anti-examples involve visual or auditory methods of marking or defining boundaries.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of scent marking for territory definition, as opposed to broader concepts of boundary marking.

Here's a breakdown of how to evaluate each candidate:

*   **Cairns:** Primarily visual markers. Doesn't fit the scent theme.
*   **Graffiti tags:** Visual markers, although the paint itself might have a smell, the primary purpose is visual.
*   **Guard dogs:**  While they might bark (auditory), their presence and scent can also act as a deterrent and territorial marker. This has a scent component.
*   **Painted property lines:** Visual markers.
*   **Barbed wire fencing:** Physical barrier, visual marker.
*   **Urine sprayed by tigers along forest paths:** Direct example of scent marking for territory.
*   **Tree blazes:** Primarily visual markers, although the exposed wood might have a scent.
*   **Hedge rows:** Primarily visual and physical barriers.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
