The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest a **sudden and catastrophic decline or destruction of something due to a specific event or human action.**

Anti-examples suggest **gradual processes occurring over extended periods.**

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the "sudden and catastrophic" theme, avoiding the "gradual process" theme.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **The collapse of the Aral Sea ecosystem following the diversion of rivers for irrigation projects.** - This sounds like a relatively sudden and significant decline due to a specific human action. High score.
2. **The gradual buildup of sediment in river deltas.** - This is a slow, natural process. Low score.
3. **The slow adaptation of species through natural selection.** - This is a very gradual process. Low score.
4. **The slow recovery of a forest after a wildfire.** - While the wildfire is sudden, the recovery is slow. Moderate to low score.
5. **The slow rusting of iron when exposed to moisture.** - This is a very gradual process. Low score.
6. **The slow desertification of certain regions due to climate change.** - This is a gradual process. Low score.
7. **The gradual urbanization of rural areas.** - This is a gradual process. Low score.
8. **The gradual increase in global temperatures due to climate change.** - This is a gradual process. Low score.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
