The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "a red fan", "a white ribbon", and "a golden mask". The anti-examples are "a cymbal", "a drumstick", and "a tambourine".

The examples suggest a theme of decorative or ceremonial objects, possibly related to performance or adornment, and they are all singular objects with a distinct color. The anti-examples are all musical instruments or parts of musical instruments.

The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding the broader theme suggested by the anti-examples (musical instruments).

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **a stage curtain**:  Could be decorative and related to performance, but not a singular object in the same way as the examples. It's more of a backdrop.
2. **a costume**:  Related to performance and adornment, similar to the mask.
3. **a harp**: A musical instrument, similar to the anti-examples.
4. **a microphone**: Used in performance, but not decorative or an object of adornment.
5. **a blue drum**: A musical instrument, directly related to the anti-examples.
6. **a violin**: A musical instrument, directly related to the anti-examples.
7. **a xylophone**: A musical instrument, directly related to the anti-examples.
8. **a maraca**: A musical instrument, directly related to the anti-examples.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
