The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit the theme defined by the examples, while explicitly avoiding the broader theme suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: Cheerios, Scott Towels, Philip Morris Cigarettes
Anti-examples: Product advertised during the first episode of "The Tonight Show", "Saturday Night Live", "The Simpsons"

The examples are all specific brands of consumer products.
The anti-examples are all about the context of advertising during a specific TV show premiere.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "well-known consumer product brands". The broader theme is "products advertised during a specific TV show premiere".

I need to score the candidates based on whether they are well-known consumer product brands, and not based on whether they were advertised during a specific TV show premiere.

Let's evaluate each candidate:
1. Product advertised during the first episode of "The Cosby Show": This fits the broader theme of advertising during a premiere, but not necessarily the specific theme of being a well-known consumer product brand. Score: 2
2. Product advertised during the Super Bowl: Similar to the above, fits the broader theme of advertising during a specific event, but not necessarily the specific theme. Score: 3
3. Product advertised during the first episode of "All in the Family":  Fits the broader theme. Score: 2
4. Product advertised during the first episode of "Cheers": Fits the broader theme. Score: 2
5. Product advertised during the first episode of "The Oprah Winfrey Show": Fits the broader theme. Score: 2
6. Product advertised during the first episode of "M*A*S*H": Fits the broader theme. Score: 2
7. Alka-Seltzer: This is a well-known consumer product brand. Score: 9
8. Product advertised during the first episode of "Seinfeld": Fits the broader theme. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>2</score>
