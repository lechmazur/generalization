The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Examples: Netflix, eBay, Amazon
Anti-examples: Facebook, Twitter, Uber

Looking at the examples, they are all platforms where users can access or purchase goods or services. Netflix provides streaming entertainment, eBay is an online auction and shopping site, and Amazon is an e-commerce platform.

The anti-examples are social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter) and a transportation network company (Uber). These are broader categories but not the specific theme of accessing/purchasing goods or services.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **platforms for accessing or purchasing goods or services online**.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Instagram: Primarily a social media platform for sharing photos and videos. While it has e-commerce features, its core function isn't direct access or purchase of goods/services in the same way as the examples. Score: Lower.
2. Spotify: A platform for streaming music and podcasts. This fits the theme of accessing a service online. Score: Higher.
3. Snapchat: Primarily a social media platform for sharing ephemeral photos and videos. Score: Lower.
4. Airbnb: A platform for booking accommodations and experiences. This fits the theme of accessing a service online. Score: Higher.
5. Google: A search engine and provider of various online services. While it facilitates access to goods and services, it's not primarily a platform for direct purchase or access in the same way as the examples. Score: Medium.
6. Slack: A communication platform for teams. Score: Lower.
7. Stripe: A payment processing platform. It facilitates transactions but isn't a platform for accessing or purchasing goods/services directly by end-users. Score: Medium-Lower.
8. Zoom: A video conferencing platform. Score: Lower.

Let's refine the scores to ensure granularity and avoid polarization.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
