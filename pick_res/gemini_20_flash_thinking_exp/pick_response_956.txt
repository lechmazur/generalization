The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are a car tire, a kitchen cabinet door, and a camera lens. The anti-examples are a Lego brick, a light bulb, and a battery.

The examples share the characteristic of being a component that can be opened or closed, or rotated, often to provide access or adjust something. They also have a degree of structural integrity.

The anti-examples are components but don't necessarily involve opening/closing or rotation in the same way. They are more about building, illumination, or power.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "a component that facilitates controlled access or adjustment through movement (rotation, opening/closing)".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples (like general components, electrical parts, or building blocks).

1. **a screw**:  Facilitates joining and can be adjusted through rotation. Seems like a good fit.
2. **a nail**: Facilitates joining but doesn't involve controlled access or adjustment after being used. Less of a fit.
3. **a modular bookshelf component**: Can be part of a structure that allows access or adjustment (like a shelf that can be moved). A moderate fit.
4. **a USB drive**:  Provides access to data but doesn't involve physical opening/closing or rotation in the same way as the examples. Low fit.
5. **a puzzle piece**:  Connects to form a whole but doesn't facilitate controlled access or adjustment in the way the examples do. Low fit.
6. **a Velcro strip**: Facilitates opening and closing. A good fit.
7. **a watch strap**: Facilitates opening and closing to secure the watch. A good fit.
8. **a zipper**: Facilitates opening and closing. A good fit.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
