The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

Examples: QR code, fingerprint scanner, augmented reality marker. These all involve a physical or visual element that is scanned or detected to trigger an action or provide information.

Anti-examples: digital signature, digital wallet, electronic ticket. These are all digital representations of something, but they don't necessarily involve a physical scanning or detection process.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be about **physical or visual markers/identifiers that are scanned or detected by a device to initiate an action or provide information.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **website URL**: While it can be scanned as a QR code, the URL itself is not inherently a physical marker. It's more of a digital address. Lower score.
2. **social media profile**: Similar to a website URL, it's a digital entity, not a physical marker. Lower score.
3. **credit card**:  It has a physical presence and can be scanned (magnetic stripe, chip, contactless). Good match.
4. **virtual meeting room**: Entirely digital, no physical scanning involved. Very low score.
5. **barcode scanner**: Directly fits the theme - a physical marker scanned by a device. Excellent match.
6. **electronic lock**: Can be activated by scanning a keycard or fingerprint. Good match.
7. **email address**:  A digital identifier, not physically scanned. Very low score.
8. **cloud storage**: A digital space, no physical scanning involved. Very low score.

Let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>8</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>9</score>
<number>6</number><score>7</score>
<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
