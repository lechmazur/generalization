The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples. The examples highlight buildings constructed with materials sourced locally. The anti-examples involve imported materials. Therefore, the specific theme is the use of exclusively local materials in construction.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it adheres to this strict definition of using *only* local materials. I will assign a score from 0 to 10 for each candidate.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1:** Uses local materials but also imported steel. This deviates from the strict theme.
*   **Candidate 2:** Uses glass manufactured elsewhere. This is not local.
*   **Candidate 3:**  Aggregates from 50 miles away. This is borderline. I need to consider what "local" means in this context. The examples suggest very close proximity.
*   **Candidate 4:** Steel from across the country is definitely not local.
*   **Candidate 5:** Clay sourced within 15 miles fits the theme well.
*   **Candidate 6:** Clay from another region is not local.
*   **Candidate 7:** Wood from the farm's property is the epitome of local.
*   **Candidate 8:** Local stone but imported granite means it doesn't strictly adhere to the theme.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
