The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme related to cars. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate the provided candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly excluding broader or related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples:
- Lamborghini 350 GT
- Aston Martin DB2
- Porsche 356

Anti-examples:
- Pagani Zonda (Modern hypercar)
- Tucker 48 (American, unusual design)
- Koenigsegg Agera (Modern hypercar)

The examples seem to be classic European sports cars from the early post-WWII era. They are front-engined, rear-wheel drive, and represent relatively early models from established marques.

The anti-examples are either very modern hypercars or a historically significant but stylistically and technologically different American car. This suggests the theme is *not* about high performance in general, nor is it about innovative or unusual designs, nor is it about modern cars.

Let's evaluate the candidates based on the "classic early post-WWII European sports car" theme:

1. McLaren F1:  High-performance, but much later and technologically advanced. Doesn't fit the era.
2. Ford Model T: Very early, mass-produced, not a sports car, American.
3. Tesla Model S: Modern, electric, four-door sedan.
4. Volkswagen Beetle:  Post-WWII and European, but mass-market and not a sports car in the same vein.
5. DeLorean DMC-12:  Later, unusual design, stainless steel body.
6. Lancia Stratos:  Mid-engined rally car, not a classic sports car.
7. Ferrari 125 S:  Early Ferrari, fits the era and style.
8. Bugatti Chiron: Modern hypercar.

Now, let's assign scores based on the degree of match to the specific theme:

- McLaren F1:  Low score, doesn't fit the era.
- Ford Model T: Very low score, wrong era, wrong type.
- Tesla Model S: Very low score, modern and different type.
- Volkswagen Beetle:  Some overlap in era and origin, but not the right type of car.
- DeLorean DMC-12:  Wrong era and style.
- Lancia Stratos: Wrong engine placement and purpose.
- Ferrari 125 S:  Strong match in era and type.
- Bugatti Chiron: Very low score, modern hypercar.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
