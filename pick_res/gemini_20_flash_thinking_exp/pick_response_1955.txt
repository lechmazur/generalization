The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme defined by the examples, while explicitly avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The core elements of the specific theme are:
- **Whole glass bottles** (not shards or broken pieces)
- **Used as a structural component** (walls, shed, bench)
- **Bound together with a material like cement/mortar**

Let's evaluate each candidate against these criteria:

Candidate 1: "A decorative wall incorporating embedded glass bottles of different colors."
- Uses whole glass bottles: Yes
- Used as a structural component (part of the wall): Yes
- Bound together: Implied by "embedded" in a wall.

Candidate 2: "A fence made of recycled plastic lumber."
- Uses whole glass bottles: No
- Material is plastic, not glass.

Candidate 3: "A stained glass window."
- Uses glass: Yes, but not whole bottles. It uses pieces of colored glass.

Candidate 4: "A road paved with recycled tires."
- Uses whole glass bottles: No
- Material is tires, not glass.

Candidate 5: "A piece of jewelry with embedded glass beads."
- Uses glass: Yes, but beads are not whole bottles.
- Not a structural component in the same way as the examples.

Candidate 6: "A recycled glass bottle used as a drinking glass."
- Uses a whole glass bottle: Yes
- Not used as a structural component in the same way as the examples. It's a functional object.

Candidate 7: "A building insulated with recycled newspaper."
- Uses whole glass bottles: No
- Material is newspaper, not glass.

Candidate 8: "A floor tiled with broken ceramic pieces."
- Uses whole glass bottles: No
- Material is ceramic, not glass, and it's broken pieces.

Now, let's assign scores based on the degree of match:

Candidate 1: Strong match - uses whole bottles structurally. Score: 9
Candidate 2: No match - wrong material. Score: 0
Candidate 3: Partial match - uses glass, but not whole bottles structurally. Score: 2
Candidate 4: No match - wrong material. Score: 0
Candidate 5: Weak match - uses glass, but not whole bottles structurally. Score: 1
Candidate 6: Moderate match - uses a whole bottle, but not structurally in the same way. Score: 5
Candidate 7: No match - wrong material. Score: 0
Candidate 8: No match - wrong material and form. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>9</score>
