The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme related to banned books. The examples highlight books banned due to political or religious reasons in specific countries or regions. The anti-examples, while also about societal control and censorship, were not necessarily banned in the same way or for the same reasons as the examples. The task is to score a list of candidate books based on how well they fit the specific theme identified from the examples.

The specific theme seems to be: **Books banned by specific governments or political/religious authorities due to their content being perceived as a threat to their ideology, power, or social order.**

Now, let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **The Catcher in the Rye:**  Frequently challenged and sometimes banned in the US for language and mature themes, but not typically by a national government for political reasons. Likely a lower score.
2. **The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn:**  Historically banned for racial slurs and perceived racism, primarily in the US. While controversial, it doesn't perfectly align with the political/religious authority banning theme. Mid-range score.
3. **Animal Farm:**  Explicitly mentioned as banned in the Soviet Union and other communist countries. This directly matches the theme. High score.
4. **Ulysses:**  Banned in the US and UK for obscenity upon initial publication. While a form of censorship, it's more about moral standards than direct political/religious threat. Mid-range score.
5. **To Kill a Mockingbird:**  Challenged and sometimes banned in the US for racial themes and language, but not typically by a national government for political reasons. Lower to mid-range score.
6. **Lady Chatterley's Lover:**  Famously banned for obscenity in several countries. Similar to Ulysses, it's more about moral censorship than political/religious. Mid-range score.
7. **Lolita:**  Banned in some countries for its subject matter (child sexual abuse). Again, primarily moral censorship, though it could have political undertones in some contexts. Mid-range score.
8. **The Color Purple:**  Challenged and sometimes banned in the US for language, sexual content, and themes of racism and violence. While it touches on social issues, it doesn't fit the specific theme of government/political/religious banning as strongly as some others. Mid-range score.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
