The user wants me to identify a specific theme based on the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Robinson Crusoe:  A man is shipwrecked on a deserted island and survives alone.
- Walden: A man deliberately isolates himself in nature to live simply.
- Into the Wild: A man abandons societal norms to live in the Alaskan wilderness and ultimately dies.

Anti-examples:
- Hatchet: A boy survives a plane crash in the wilderness. Focus is on survival, but it's accidental.
- Lord of the Flies:  A group of boys are stranded on an island and descend into savagery. Focus is on social dynamics and loss of innocence.
- Life of Pi: A boy is stranded at sea with animals. Focus is on survival and fantastical elements.

The specific theme seems to be about **intentional, solitary immersion in nature, often involving a rejection of society**. The anti-examples involve elements of survival in nature, but they lack the intentional and solitary aspect, or focus on group dynamics.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.

1. The Martian:  Stranded on Mars, survival is key, but it's not a deliberate choice to immerse in nature on Earth. Score: 2
2. The Call of the Wild: A domesticated dog becomes wild. Involves nature, but not necessarily solitary or intentional in the human sense. Score: 5
3. Moby-Dick:  A whaling voyage. Focus is on the hunt and the crew, not solitary immersion. Score: 1
4. The Old Man and the Sea: A fisherman's struggle with a giant marlin. Focus is on the struggle and the fish, not solitary immersion in nature as a chosen lifestyle. Score: 3
5. My Side of the Mountain: A boy runs away to live in the Catskill Mountains. This fits the theme well. Score: 9
6. The Secret Garden: Children find a hidden garden and nurture it back to life. Focus is on healing and relationships, not solitary immersion. Score: 2
7. Where the Crawdads Sing: A girl grows up isolated in the marshes. Has elements of solitary life in nature, but also strong social connections and a mystery element. Score: 7
8. The Road: A father and son travel through a post-apocalyptic landscape. Focus is on survival and their relationship, not intentional solitary immersion. Score: 4<number>1</number><score>2</score>
