The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader one.

The examples are "Iron Mountain", "Gold Coast", and "Silver City". These all seem to be places named after a specific precious or semi-precious metal or mineral.

The anti-examples are "Oil City", "Leadville", and "Coalville". These are also places named after resources, but they are not precious or semi-precious metals. This confirms the specific theme is about places named after precious or semi-precious metals or minerals.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.

1. Granite Falls: Granite is a mineral, but not typically considered precious or semi-precious in the same way as gold, silver, or iron.
2. Zinc City: Zinc is a metal, but less commonly considered "precious" than gold or silver. It fits the theme better than granite.
3. Clay County: Clay is a common earth material, not a precious or semi-precious metal.
4. Steel City: Steel is an alloy of iron, not a naturally occurring precious or semi-precious metal. While related to iron, it's not the same.
5. Tin City: Tin is a metal, but less commonly considered "precious" than gold or silver. Similar to zinc.
6. Marble Canyon: Marble is a stone, often decorative, but not a metal.
7. Salt Lake City: Salt is a mineral, but not a metal, and not typically considered precious.
8. Copper River: Copper is a metal, and while not as precious as gold or silver, it's more so than tin or zinc.
