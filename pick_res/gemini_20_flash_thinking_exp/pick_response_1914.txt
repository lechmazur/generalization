The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are all enclosed, circular or semi-enclosed structures used for ritual or communal purposes. The anti-examples are open or earthen structures, often with ceremonial or burial purposes, but lacking the enclosed nature of the examples.

Let's evaluate each candidate:
1. **An igloo:** Enclosed structure, but primarily for dwelling, not ritual.
2. **A teepee:**  Enclosed structure, but more for dwelling, though it can have ceremonial uses.
3. **A pyramid:**  Not enclosed in the same way, more of a solid structure.
4. **A kiva used as a living space:**  While a kiva is an example, using it as a living space shifts its primary function away from the ritualistic aspect.
5. **A marae of the MƒÅori people:**  A communal and ceremonial space, often enclosed.
6. **A ziggurat:**  A stepped tower, not an enclosed space.
7. **A totem pole:**  A vertical monument, not an enclosed structure.
8. **A longhouse:**  An enclosed dwelling, but primarily for living, not ritual.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
