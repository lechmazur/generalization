The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme related to religious or culturally significant structures. The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the *specific* theme, not a broader interpretation.

Let's analyze the examples:
- Mayan pyramids: Religious ceremonies, specific culture.
- Stupas: Buddhist traditions, specific culture.
- Totem poles: Indigenous cultures, symbolic representation.

The core elements seem to be:
- Religious/spiritual significance.
- Strong cultural association.
- Often used for ritualistic purposes.

Now let's analyze the anti-examples:
- Chinese pagodas: Religious (Buddhist/Taoist), but architecturally different from pyramids/stupas/totem poles.
- Greek temples: Religious, but different cultural context and purpose.
- Egyptian obelisks: Religious/symbolic, but different form and function.

The anti-examples highlight that the theme is not just "religious structures" or "culturally significant monuments." It's more specific than that. The specific theme seems to revolve around monumental structures with a strong connection to ritualistic practices within a particular cultural context, often with a distinct architectural style.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Roman amphitheaters: Primarily for entertainment (gladiatorial contests, public spectacles), not primarily religious. Broader theme: public gathering spaces.
2. Torii gates: Mark the transition from the mundane to the sacred in Shinto. Strong religious significance within a specific culture.
3. Native American sweat lodges: Used for purification rituals, strong cultural and spiritual significance. Might be a good fit.
4. Stonehenge: Prehistoric monument, likely with ritualistic and astronomical significance. Fits the criteria of religious/cultural significance.
5. Islamic minarets: Part of mosques, used for the call to prayer. Religious significance, but different function and architectural style compared to the examples.
6. Medieval cathedrals: Christian religious structures, but architecturally distinct and with different primary functions than the examples.
7. Hindu temples: Religious structures, but architecturally different and with different ritualistic practices compared to the examples.
8. Aztec ball courts: Used for ritualistic ball games with religious significance. Strong cultural connection and ritualistic purpose.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores to each candidate, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
