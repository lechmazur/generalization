The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Looking at the examples:
- The Alienist: A historical crime drama featuring a psychologist (alienist) investigating murders.
- Dexter: A contemporary crime drama featuring a forensic technician who is also a serial killer.
- The Mentalist: A contemporary crime drama featuring a consultant with heightened observational skills who helps solve crimes.

Common elements in the examples:
- Protagonist with unique skills or background related to psychology or mental processes.
- Focus on solving crimes, often murder.
- The protagonist is often involved in the investigation process, either officially or unofficially.

Looking at the anti-examples:
- Miss Marple: An elderly amateur detective who solves crimes through observation and understanding of human nature.
- The Silence of the Lambs: A psychological thriller focusing on catching a serial killer, with a strong emphasis on criminal psychology but the protagonist is an FBI trainee.
- Sherlock Holmes: A brilliant detective who uses deduction and observation to solve crimes.

The anti-examples share the theme of crime solving but lack the specific element of the protagonist having a background or skill set explicitly related to psychology or mental processes in the same way as the examples.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be crime dramas where the protagonist has a profession or unique skill set directly related to psychology, mental processes, or forensic science, and uses this expertise to solve crimes.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Hercule Poirot: A brilliant detective who uses "little grey cells" (his mind) to solve crimes. While mental acuity is key, it's not explicitly a psychological profession or forensic science. Closer to Sherlock Holmes.
2. Nancy Drew: A teenage amateur sleuth. Doesn't fit the psychological/forensic profile.
3. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time: Features a protagonist with autism who uses his unique way of thinking to solve a mystery. Has a strong element of mental processes being central to the investigation.
4. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: Features a journalist and a hacker investigating crimes. The hacker has unique skills, but not specifically psychological.
5. The Cuckoo's Calling: Features a war veteran turned private investigator. While he might use observation skills, it's not explicitly psychological.
6. The Big Sleep: A classic hardboiled detective novel. The protagonist is a private investigator.
7. The Maltese Falcon: Another hardboiled detective novel. The protagonist is a private investigator.
8. The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency: Features a female private detective in Botswana.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
