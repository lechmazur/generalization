The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Unwrapping a candy bar", "Peeling a banana", and "Shucking an oyster". These all involve removing an outer layer to access something inside. The anti-examples are "Shelling peanuts", "Skinning an animal", and "Cracking a nut". These involve removing an outer layer, but often with more force or a different type of outer layer.

The core of the specific theme seems to be *removing an outer layer of food or a consumable item in a relatively gentle manner to access the edible or usable part*. The anti-examples involve harder shells or more involved processes.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Sharpening a pencil**: This involves removing material, but not to access something inside. It's about changing the shape. Likely a low score.
2. **Breaking an egg**: This involves breaking a shell to access the contents. It's similar to the examples, but the method is more forceful than peeling or unwrapping. A moderate score.
3. **Butchering meat**: This is a more involved process than simply removing an outer layer. It involves cutting and separating. Likely a low score.
4. **Opening a present**: This is very similar to unwrapping a candy bar. A high score.
5. **Taking off a jacket**: This involves removing an outer layer, but it's clothing, not food or a consumable item. A low to moderate score.
6. **Unboxing a new phone**: Similar to opening a present, but the item is more complex. Still fits the idea of removing an outer layer to access the usable item. A high score.
7. **Cleaning a fish**: This involves removing scales and innards, which is more involved than simply removing an outer layer. A moderate score.
8. **Removing the husk from an ear of corn**: This is very similar to peeling a banana or shucking an oyster. A high score.

Now, let's assign specific scores, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
