The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all jellyfish (Class Scyphozoa).
The anti-examples are all tunicates (Class Thaliacea, Salpidae; Class Thaliacea, Doliolidae; and Class Appendicularia, although Pyrosoma is a colonial thaliacean). These are all free-swimming tunicates.

The specific theme is likely "Scyphozoa" or "True Jellyfish". The broader theme could be "gelatinous zooplankton" or "pelagic invertebrates".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether it is a Scyphozoan.

1. Ophiuroidea: Brittle stars. Not Scyphozoa.
2. Tunicata: Tunicates. This is a broad category that includes the anti-examples. Not Scyphozoa.
3. Asteroidea: Starfish. Not Scyphozoa.
4. Cnidaria: Phylum that includes jellyfish, but also corals, anemones, etc. Broader category.
5. Thaliacea:  Salps. One of the anti-examples. Not Scyphozoa.
6. Appendicularia: Larvaceans. One of the anti-examples. Not Scyphozoa.
7. Ctenophora: Comb jellies. Gelatinous, but not Scyphozoa.
8. Pelagia noctiluca: A jellyfish. Specifically a Scyphozoan.

Now I need to assign scores from 0 to 10 based on how well they match *specifically* being a Scyphozoan.

1. Ophiuroidea: 0 (not even close)
2. Tunicata: 1 (related in that they are animals, but very different)
3. Asteroidea: 0 (not even close)
4. Cnidaria: 6 (in the same phylum, but not the specific class)
5. Thaliacea: 1 (one of the anti-examples)
6. Appendicularia: 1 (one of the anti-examples)
7. Ctenophora: 3 (gelatinous and planktonic, but different phylum)
8. Pelagia noctiluca: 10 (it's a Scyphozoan, like the examples)<number>1</number><score>0</score>
