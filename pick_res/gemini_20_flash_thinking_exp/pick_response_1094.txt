The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (gargoyles, Christmas trees, wedding rings) share the characteristic of being **symbolic objects often associated with specific traditions, rituals, or beliefs, and often placed or worn in a prominent or meaningful way.**

The anti-examples (totems, crowns, masks) are also symbolic objects, but they represent broader categories of symbolism, often related to power, identity, or spiritual connection in a more general sense.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **symbolic objects associated with specific, often Western, traditions or rituals.**

Now, I will evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **pottery:** Can be symbolic, but not inherently tied to specific Western traditions in the same way as the examples. Score: 3
2. **coins:** Can be symbolic (wealth, nationhood), but not as directly tied to specific rituals or traditions as the examples. Score: 4
3. **drums:** Can be part of rituals, but not specifically Western traditions in the same way. Score: 2
4. **tattoos:** Can be symbolic, but more about personal expression than specific shared traditions in the same vein as the examples. Score: 3
5. **high heels:**  Associated with fashion and social norms, which can be seen as traditions, but less overtly ritualistic or symbolic in the same way as the examples. Score: 5
6. **swords:** Can be symbolic (power, honor), but not as directly tied to specific, ongoing traditions in the same way as the examples. Score: 4
7. **flags:** Symbolic of nations and identity, which are forms of tradition, but less about personal rituals or beliefs in the same way as the examples. Score: 5
8. **pyramids:**  Symbolic and associated with ancient cultures, but not the same kind of ongoing, often Western, traditions as the examples. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>3</score>
