The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by "An underground vault beneath a library", "A hidden bunker beneath a farmhouse", and "A concealed tunnel system under a shopping mall". The anti-examples ("A subway station beneath a city street", "A fallout shelter beneath a government building", "A metro line under a downtown area") highlight that the theme is *not* just any underground structure.

The key elements of the specific theme seem to be:
- **Underground:** This is consistent across all examples.
- **Beneath a specific, identifiable, and relatively self-contained structure or area:** Library, farmhouse, shopping mall. The anti-examples are under more general areas (city street, government building, downtown area).
- **Implied secrecy or non-public access:** "Vault", "hidden", "concealed". The anti-examples are generally public transportation or emergency infrastructure.

Now, let's evaluate each candidate against these criteria:

1. **A crypt beneath a church:**  Underground and beneath a specific structure. Crypts can have an element of secrecy or limited access. Good match.
2. **A service tunnel beneath an airport:** Underground and beneath a specific structure. Service tunnels are not generally public access. Good match.
3. **A subway tunnel under a river:** Underground, but "under a river" is more general than under a specific structure. This aligns more with the anti-examples.
4. **A pedestrian underpass beneath a highway:** Underground, but "beneath a highway" is more general infrastructure. Public access. Closer to the anti-examples.
5. **A utility tunnel under a university campus:** Underground and beneath a specific area (campus). Utility tunnels are not generally public access. Good match.
6. **A secret laboratory under a city park:** Underground and beneath a specific area. "Secret" strongly aligns with the implied secrecy. Excellent match.
7. **A drainage system under a city:** Underground, but "under a city" is very general. Public infrastructure. Aligns with the anti-examples.
8. **A catacomb under a historic site:** Underground and beneath a specific area. Catacombs have an element of historical secrecy or limited access. Good match.
