The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by the provided examples, while explicitly avoiding broader, related themes illustrated by the anti-examples.

The core of the specific theme seems to be the **controlled, experimental evaluation of prosthetic devices in a laboratory or testing setting**. The examples involve:
- Robotic arm manipulating objects to test grip strength.
- Biomechanical rig applying forces to test joint mechanics.
- Treadmill with sensors analyzing gait with a prosthetic leg.

The anti-examples, representing broader themes, involve:
- Real-world use of a prosthetic.
- Computer modeling of a prosthetic.
- Biofeedback control of a prosthetic.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on its alignment with the controlled, experimental evaluation aspect, and penalize those that lean towards real-world use, design, or control aspects.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

1. **Psychological impact of limb loss:** This is about the user, not the device's performance in a controlled setting. Low score.
2. **VR environment for task evaluation:** This involves a simulated environment for evaluating user control, which aligns with the controlled evaluation aspect. High score.
3. **Occupational therapist assessing daily tasks:** This is about real-world functionality and patient ability, not controlled device testing. Low score.
4. **Software program to control a prosthetic:** This focuses on the control mechanism, not the experimental evaluation of the device itself. Medium-low score.
5. **Clinical trial evaluating a new design:** While it involves evaluation, it's in a clinical setting with real users, not a controlled lab environment. Medium score.
6. **Rehabilitation center specializing in training:** This is about user training and adaptation, not controlled device testing. Low score.
7. **Nerve interface connecting a prosthetic:** This is about the technology enabling control, not the experimental evaluation of the prosthetic's performance. Medium-low score.
8. **Pressure sensor embedded in a socket:** This is a component of the prosthetic itself, potentially used for feedback or control, but not directly about controlled experimental evaluation. Medium score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
