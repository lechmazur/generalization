The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify this specific theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, while explicitly avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are all algorithms or systems that generate seemingly random outputs for a specific purpose or application.
The anti-examples are all physical or purely mathematical methods of generating random numbers without a specific application in mind.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Algorithms or systems that generate seemingly random outputs for a specific, practical application.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>8</score>
<number>3</number><score>3</score>
<number>4</number><score>6</score>
<number>5</number><score>7</score>
<number>6</number><score>5</score>
<number>7</number><score>4</score>
<number>8</number><score>3</score>
