The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme from the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they match *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are all islands named after explorers.
The anti-examples are all artificial island archipelagos.

Therefore, the specific theme is "islands named after explorers".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.
