The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The anti-examples are designed to mislead me towards broader themes.

The examples all involve:
- Monumental or significant cultural artifacts
- Located in the Pacific Islands
- Constructed from volcanic rock

The anti-examples involve:
- Tools or smaller artifacts
- Located in various regions outside the specific Pacific Island region
- Made from various types of stone

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "Monumental cultural artifacts in the Pacific Islands made from volcanic rock".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. Limestone sculptures in Thailand: Wrong material, wrong location.
2. Stone adzes fashioned from obsidian in the Solomon Islands: Right location, right material (volcanic), but not monumental.
3. Cave paintings in Indonesia: Right location, but wrong type of artifact and material.
4. Wood carvings in Papua New Guinea: Right location, but wrong material.
5. Volcanic hot springs in New Zealand: Right location and related to volcanism, but not a cultural artifact.
6. Volcanic eruptions in Iceland: Wrong location, not a cultural artifact.
7. Jade ornaments in New Zealand: Right location, but wrong material and not monumental.
8. Marble statues in Greece: Wrong location and wrong material.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
