The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The anti-examples are designed to be misleading, representing broader or related themes.

The examples (Roy Harris, Aaron Copland, Henry Cowell) are all American composers known for their distinct American sound, often incorporating folk elements and a sense of spaciousness. They are generally associated with a more modernist but still tonal or modal approach.

The anti-examples (William Grant Still, George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein) are also American composers, but they represent different facets of American music. Still is known for incorporating African American musical traditions, Gershwin for jazz influences, and Bernstein for his eclecticism and Broadway connections. These are the "broader themes" I need to avoid focusing on.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "American composers of the mid-20th century known for a distinct American sound, often incorporating folk elements and a modernist but generally tonal or modal approach."

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes represented by the anti-examples.

1. **Charles Ives:**  Definitely fits the specific theme. Pioneering American modernist, incorporated folk elements. High score.
2. **Howard Hanson:** Fits well. Known for a romantic and distinctly American sound.
3. **Amy Beach:**  A bit earlier than the core of the theme, but a significant American composer. Might be slightly less central.
4. **Percy Grainger:**  A complex case. While he spent significant time in America and incorporated folk music, his style is somewhat unique and international. A moderate score.
5. **Charles Griffes:**  Fits well. American composer with impressionistic and modernist elements.
6. **Béla Bartók:**  While influential, he's primarily Hungarian. Doesn't fit the "American" aspect of the theme. Low score.
7. **Ralph Vaughan Williams:**  British composer. Doesn't fit the "American" aspect. Low score.
8. **Igor Stravinsky:**  Russian-born, later American citizen, but his core work isn't primarily associated with the specific "American sound" of the examples. Moderate score.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
