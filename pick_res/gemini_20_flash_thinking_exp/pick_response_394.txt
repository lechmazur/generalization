The user has provided three examples (Kathakali, Hula, Noh) and three anti-examples (Mime, Butoh, Folk dance) of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations that might include the anti-examples.

The examples suggest highly stylized, traditional dance forms with strong cultural and often theatrical elements. The anti-examples, while related to performance, lack some of the key characteristics of the examples. Mime is non-dance, Butoh is more avant-garde and less traditional in the same way, and Folk dance is too broad and less focused on highly specific, codified forms.

The specific theme seems to be **highly stylized, traditional theatrical dance forms with specific cultural origins and codified movements and narratives.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Modern dance:**  While a dance form, it's generally less traditional and more about individual expression than the examples. It leans towards the broader theme.
2. **Bharatanatyam:** This is a classical Indian dance form, highly stylized and traditional, fitting the theme well.
3. **Jazz dance:**  More modern and less strictly traditional in the same way as the examples. It's closer to the broader theme.
4. **Capoeira:**  A Brazilian martial art that incorporates dance elements. While culturally specific, it's not primarily a theatrical dance form in the same vein as the examples.
5. **Shadow puppetry:**  Not a dance form at all, though it is theatrical.
6. **Ballet:**  Highly stylized and traditional, with codified movements and narratives. Fits the theme well.
7. **Contemporary dance:**  Similar to modern dance, it's less strictly traditional and more about individual expression.
8. **Flamenco:**  A highly stylized Spanish dance form with strong cultural roots. Fits the theme well.
