The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

The examples all involve a visual representation of items moving through distinct stages of a process. The anti-examples involve tracking information or dependencies but not necessarily the visual movement of items through stages.

Therefore, the specific theme is the visual tracking of items progressing through defined stages of a process using a board-like structure.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

1. **Dashboard displaying KPIs:** This is about displaying information, not necessarily tracking items through stages. Low score.
2. **Kanban board:** This directly matches the theme. High score.
3. **Network diagram:** This shows dependencies, not the movement of items through stages. Low score.
4. **Bug tracking system:** This tracks the status of bugs, which could be seen as stages, but it's not necessarily visual or board-based in the same way. Medium score.
5. **Flowchart:** This illustrates a process but doesn't necessarily involve the visual tracking of individual items moving through stages. Medium score.
6. **Queue management system:** This tracks the order of items in a queue, which can be seen as stages. It's visual and tracks movement. High score.
7. **CRM system:** This manages customer relationships, which can involve stages, but it's not primarily a visual board for tracking movement. Medium score.
8. **Database of customer information:** This is about storing information, not tracking movement through stages. Low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
