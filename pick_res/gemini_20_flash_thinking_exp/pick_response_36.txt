The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest:
- Metal frame/mounting
- Mineral/stone material used for a functional object (lighting, bookend, sconce)

Anti-examples suggest:
- No metal frame/mounting
- Carved/polished solid mineral/stone as a decorative object

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "functional decorative objects featuring a metal frame or mounting and a mineral/stone component".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of just "decorative objects made of natural materials".
