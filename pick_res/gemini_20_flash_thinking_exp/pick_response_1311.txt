The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples (Prefabricated modular homes, LEGO building sets, Modular smartphone designs) suggest a theme of **modularity and prefabrication/assembly from discrete units**.

The anti-examples (Monolithic architecture, Traditional brick-and-mortar construction, Hardwired electrical system) highlight the *lack* of modularity and prefabrication, emphasizing single-piece construction or permanent, non-easily-modified systems.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it embodies the idea of being built from discrete, interchangeable, and combinable units.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for each candidate:

*   **Traditional wooden furniture:** While it can be assembled, it's not typically designed for easy reconfiguration or interchangeability of parts in the same way as the examples. Score: Lower end.
*   **Single-piece car body:** This is the opposite of modular. Score: Very low.
*   **Non-modular kitchen appliance:**  Explicitly states "non-modular," so it's a poor fit. Score: Very low.
*   **Modular shelving units:** Directly matches the concept of modularity. Score: High.
*   **Single-piece cast iron skillet:**  A single, unified object. Score: Very low.
*   **Fixed seating in a theater:**  Permanent and not designed for reconfiguration. Score: Very low.
*   **Integrated washing machine:** While it has internal components, it's sold and used as a single unit, not easily broken down and reconfigured by the user. Score: Lower end.
*   **Non-modular power supply:** Explicitly states "non-modular." Score: Very low.

Now I will assign granular scores within the 0-10 range, considering the nuances.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
