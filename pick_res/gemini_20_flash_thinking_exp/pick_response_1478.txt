The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples highlight the intentional preservation of certain characteristics of analog media or signals during digital conversion. The anti-examples showcase digital conversion without such intentional preservation or alteration.

The task is to evaluate candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, using a scale of 0 to 10. The scores should be granular and nuanced, avoiding polarization.

Let's analyze each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1:**  A digital audio interface converts analog to digital. This is a general conversion, similar to the anti-examples. It doesn't inherently imply intentional preservation of analog characteristics.
*   **Candidate 2:** Filtering out unwanted frequencies is the opposite of preserving analog characteristics. This aligns with the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 3:** Converting drawings to vector graphics is a transformation, not necessarily focused on preserving analog nuances. Similar to the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 4:** Converting handwritten notes to text is a functional transformation, not about preserving the analog feel. Similar to the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 5:** Converting sensor data is a general analog-to-digital conversion, like the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 6:** Converting radio signals is a standard digital conversion, similar to the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 7:** Converting TV signals is a standard digital conversion, similar to the anti-examples.
*   **Candidate 8:** Film grain emulation is a direct example of intentionally preserving an analog aesthetic in a digital format. This strongly aligns with the examples.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
