The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they match *only* that specific theme. The anti-examples are designed to mislead me towards broader themes.

The examples are:
- Version control systems (e.g., Git)
- GPS satellite systems
- Network Time Protocol (NTP)

These all seem to involve maintaining a consistent state or time across multiple systems or locations. They are also foundational technologies that other systems rely on.

The anti-examples are:
- Cloud storage services (rely on version control and networks, but are a higher-level application)
- Online banking systems (rely on secure networks and time synchronization, but are application-specific)
- Smartwatches (can use GPS and sync time, but are end-user devices)

The specific theme seems to be **foundational, distributed systems that maintain a consistent state or time across multiple points.**

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme:

1. Streaming services: Rely on networks, but the core function isn't about maintaining a consistent state across multiple points in the same way as the examples. More about delivering content.
2. Home security systems: Can involve time synchronization and distributed sensors, but the primary goal is security, not state consistency in the same foundational way.
3. Voice assistants: Rely on networks and time, but are application-level and not foundational in the same sense.
4. Smart TVs: Rely on networks and time, but are end-user devices.
5. Home Wi-Fi routers:  A foundational networking component, crucial for connectivity and time synchronization within a local network.
6. Fitness trackers: Can use GPS and sync time, but are end-user devices.
7. Distributed databases:  Explicitly designed to maintain a consistent state across multiple nodes. This is a strong match.
8. Smartphone apps:  Too broad and application-specific.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
