The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- Automated assembly line in a factory
- Cardiac pacemaker
- Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver

The anti-examples are:
- Stopwatch
- Metronome
- Wristwatch

The examples suggest a theme of **automated systems that control or regulate a process or function over time, often with a degree of precision and feedback**. The anti-examples, while related to timekeeping, lack the automated control aspect of the examples.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A train schedule:**  While it dictates timing, it's not an automated system that *controls* the trains. It's a plan.
2. **A calendar:**  Similar to a train schedule, it's a plan for time, not an active control system.
3. **A high-speed computer network:** This facilitates communication and data transfer, but doesn't inherently control a process in the same way as the examples.
4. **A traffic light system:** This is an automated system that controls the flow of traffic over time.
5. **An hourglass:**  A passive timekeeping device, not an automated control system.
6. **A kitchen timer:**  Similar to a stopwatch, it measures time but doesn't actively control a process.
7. **A sundial:**  A passive timekeeping device, not an automated control system.
8. **A cuckoo clock:**  While it has some automated elements (the cuckoo), its primary function is timekeeping, not process control.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>4</score>
<number>4</number><score>9</score>
<number>5</number><score>0</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>0</score>
<number>8</number><score>2</score>
