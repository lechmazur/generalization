The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and ensure the anti-examples do not fit this specific theme. Then, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the *specific* theme, not a broader or related theme.

Examples: Television, Helicopter, Ballpoint pen
Anti-examples: Artificial intelligence, Electric car, Self-driving car

The examples seem to be physical inventions or devices that were significant technological advancements in their time. The anti-examples are more abstract concepts or systems that rely on complex software and computation.

Specific theme:  Physical, tangible inventions/devices that represent significant technological advancements and are generally recognizable as standalone objects.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. 3D printer: A physical device, a technological advancement. Seems to fit.
2. Smartphone: A physical device, a significant technological advancement. Seems to fit.
3. Augmented reality: More of a concept or experience enabled by technology, not a standalone physical invention.
4. GPS navigation: A system or technology, not a standalone physical invention.
5. Virtual reality headset: A physical device, a technological advancement. Seems to fit.
6. Radar: A system or technology, although it involves physical hardware.
7. Drone: A physical device, a technological advancement. Seems to fit.
8. Quantum computing: More of a field or type of computation, not a standalone physical invention readily recognizable by the average person.

Let's assign scores based on this understanding.<number>1</number><score>7</score>
