The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are Rainstick, Native American flute, and Ocean drum. These all seem to be instruments that evoke natural sounds or are traditionally associated with nature or indigenous cultures. The anti-examples are Talking drum, Djembe, and Kalimba. These are all percussive instruments, often associated with African music. The key is to differentiate between instruments that evoke natural sounds/are associated with nature/indigenous cultures (specific theme) and general percussion instruments (broader theme).

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Didgeridoo:**  Often associated with Aboriginal Australian culture and produces a drone-like sound, fitting the natural/indigenous aspect.
2. **Gamelan:**  A traditional Indonesian ensemble, often featuring metallophones and gongs. While culturally significant, it doesn't strongly evoke natural sounds in the same way.
3. **Sitar:**  An Indian stringed instrument. While culturally rich, it doesn't fit the natural sound or indigenous association as strongly.
4. **Tabla:**  Indian percussion drums. Clearly falls into the broader percussion category, like the anti-examples.
5. **Maracas:**  Rattling instruments, often filled with seeds or beans, which could have a slight connection to natural sounds, but are generally percussive.
6. **Bongos:**  Hand drums, clearly in the percussion category.
7. **Shakuhachi:**  A Japanese bamboo flute. Fits the natural material and potentially the evocation of natural sounds.
8. **Koto:**  A Japanese zither. While traditional, it doesn't strongly align with the natural sound or indigenous association.

Now, let's assign scores, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
