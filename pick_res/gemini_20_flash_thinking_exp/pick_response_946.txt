The user wants me to identify the specific theme from the examples and score the candidates based on how well they match that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core elements of the theme are:
- **Distributed ledger technology (specifically blockchain or similar)**
- **Supply chain focus**
- **Verification/tracking of goods (pharmaceuticals, produce, luxury goods)**

Let's evaluate each candidate against these core elements:

1. **a smart contract platform for real estate transactions**: Uses blockchain, but not focused on physical goods or supply chains. Broader theme connection, but not the specific one.
2. **a blockchain-based energy trading platform**: Uses blockchain, but not focused on physical goods or supply chains. Broader theme connection, but not the specific one.
3. **a centralized inventory management software**:  Focuses on inventory, but not distributed ledger. Falls into a broader category of supply chain management tools.
4. **a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagging system**:  Related to tracking goods, but not a distributed ledger. Falls into a broader category of supply chain tracking technologies.
5. **a GPS tracking system for fleet management**:  Related to tracking, but not physical goods in a supply chain context in the same way. Broader theme connection.
6. **a manual paper-based record-keeping system**:  Related to record-keeping, but not distributed ledger or automated. Falls into a very broad category.
7. **a warehouse management system**:  Related to managing goods, but not a distributed ledger or focused on the entire supply chain. Broader theme connection.
8. **a blockchain solution for ensuring ethical sourcing of conflict-free minerals**: Uses blockchain and focuses on the origin/authenticity of goods in a supply chain context. This is a strong match.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
