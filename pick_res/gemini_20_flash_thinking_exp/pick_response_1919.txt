The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "tornado", "black hole", and "hurricane". These are all powerful, rotating natural phenomena. The anti-examples are "windmill", "turbine", and "propeller". These are human-made devices that rotate to generate power or motion.

The specific theme seems to be naturally occurring, powerful, rotating phenomena. The broader theme could be rotating objects or devices.

I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme (natural, powerful, rotating phenomena) and not the broader theme (rotating objects/devices).

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:
1. ceiling fan: Rotates, but is man-made and not a powerful natural phenomenon.
2. water wheel: Rotates, uses natural power (water), but is man-made.
3. spinning top: Rotates, but is small and man-made.
4. blender: Rotates, but is man-made and not a natural phenomenon.
5. gyroscope: Rotates, but is a device and not a natural phenomenon.
6. whirlpool: Naturally occurring, rotating, and can be powerful.
7. helicopter rotor: Rotates, but is man-made.
8. food processor: Rotates, but is man-made.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
