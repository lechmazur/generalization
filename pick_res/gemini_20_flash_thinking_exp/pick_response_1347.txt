The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not broader related themes.

The examples are all phase changes of water.
The anti-examples are broader Earth system processes.

Therefore, the specific theme is **phase changes of water**.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether it represents a phase change of water.

1. Soil formation: Not a phase change of water.
2. Volcanic eruption: Not a phase change of water.
3. Ocean currents: Movement of liquid water, not a phase change.
4. Sublimation of dry ice: Phase change, but of carbon dioxide, not water.
5. Glacial movement: Movement of solid water (ice), not a phase change.
6. Decomposition of organic matter: Not a phase change of water.
7. Wind erosion: Movement of materials by wind, not a phase change of water.
8. Rock erosion by wind: Movement of rock by wind, not a phase change of water.

Let's assign scores based on how close they are to the specific theme, even if they don't perfectly match.

1. Soil formation: Very distant. Score: 1
2. Volcanic eruption: Very distant. Score: 0
3. Ocean currents: Involves water, but not a phase change. Score: 2
4. Sublimation of dry ice: Is a phase change, but of a different substance. Relatively close in concept. Score: 6
5. Glacial movement: Involves water in solid form, but not a phase change. Score: 3
6. Decomposition of organic matter: Very distant. Score: 1
7. Wind erosion: Distant. Score: 1
8. Rock erosion by wind: Distant. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>1</score>
