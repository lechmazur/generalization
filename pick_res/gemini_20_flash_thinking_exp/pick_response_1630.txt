The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate the provided candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples are:
- The sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system
- The cuneiform script
- The lunar calendar system

The anti-examples are:
- The Gregorian calendar
- The Julian calendar
- The Egyptian calendar

The examples point towards ancient Mesopotamian civilization. The sexagesimal system and cuneiform script are strongly associated with Sumer and Babylon. The lunar calendar was also used in ancient Mesopotamia.

The anti-examples are all solar calendars. This reinforces the idea that the specific theme is related to ancient Mesopotamian practices.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "Ancient Mesopotamian systems of timekeeping and recording information".

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **The Chinese lunar calendar:** While it's a lunar calendar, it's not Mesopotamian.
2. **The Aztec calendar:**  A calendar system, but not Mesopotamian.
3. **The vigesimal (base-20) numeral system:**  A numeral system, but not Mesopotamian (primarily associated with Mayan cultures).
4. **The decimal (base-10) numeral system:** A numeral system, but not specifically Mesopotamian.
5. **The hieroglyphic script:** An ancient writing system, but primarily associated with Egypt, not Mesopotamia.
6. **The zodiac and its division into 12 signs:**  While the zodiac has Mesopotamian origins, the division into 12 signs is a later development and more broadly adopted.
7. **The Mayan calendar:** A calendar system, but not Mesopotamian.
8. **The alphabet:** A writing system, but not cuneiform and not specifically Mesopotamian in its earliest form.

Now, I will assign scores based on the degree of match to the specific theme.

- Strong match: Directly related to ancient Mesopotamia.
- Moderate match:  Related to the *type* of system (calendar, numeral system, writing) but not Mesopotamian.
- Weak match:  Tangentially related or a later development of a Mesopotamian concept.
- No match:  Not related to ancient Mesopotamia.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
