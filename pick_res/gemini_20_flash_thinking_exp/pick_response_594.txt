The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the examples and score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are all flexible containers made of woven or fibrous material, used for holding bulk goods.

The anti-examples are rigid containers or vehicles for transporting bulk goods.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "flexible container made of woven or fibrous material for holding bulk goods".

I need to score each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, considering the material, flexibility, and intended use for bulk goods.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
<number>2</number><score>8</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>2</score>
<number>5</number><score>3</score>
<number>6</number><score>7</score>
<number>7</number><score>0</score>
<number>8</number><score>6</score>
