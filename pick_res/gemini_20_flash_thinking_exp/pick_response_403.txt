The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: gooseneck desk lamp, bendy drinking straw, adjustable phone mount
Anti-examples: rope ladder, venetian blinds, chain necklace

The core theme seems to be about items that are flexible or adjustable in a way that allows them to be positioned or shaped differently, often maintaining that shape. The anti-examples highlight that the theme is *not* simply about things made of connected segments or things that can be extended or retracted in a linear fashion.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. charm bracelet:  While it has connected links, its flexibility is more about draping than holding a specific shape. It's closer to the chain necklace anti-example.
2. watch band: Similar to a charm bracelet, it's flexible but doesn't hold a specific shape in the same way as the examples.
3. bicycle chain:  Designed for movement around gears, its flexibility is functional but not about holding a pose. Similar to the chain necklace.
4. dog leash:  Flexible for control, but not designed to be shaped and stay in that shape.
5. bead string:  Very flexible, but like the charm bracelet, it drapes rather than holds a specific form.
6. flexible tripod:  This fits the theme well. The legs can be bent and adjusted to different positions and will hold that shape.
7. measuring tape:  Can be extended and retracted, but its flexibility is linear and doesn't involve holding a complex shape.
8. beaded curtain:  Flexible in that the strands can move, but not in the way the examples suggest. It's more about movement and separation.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate, ensuring a range of values is used.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
