The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are "alchemical mercury", "mandrake root", and "obsidian". These all seem to relate to ingredients or materials used in esoteric practices, particularly those with a historical or natural element. The anti-examples are "divining rod", "crystal ball", and "astrological chart". These relate to methods or tools for divination or understanding the future, which is a related but distinct concept.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **natural materials with esoteric or magical properties/uses, particularly those with historical significance or a tangible, physical presence.** The broader theme is divination or magical practices in general.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme, avoiding the broader theme.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

1. **tarot cards:**  More of a divination tool (like the anti-examples). Doesn't fit the "natural material" aspect strongly.
2. **smudging sage:**  A natural material with ritualistic/esoteric use. Good fit.
3. **voodoo doll:**  Involves materials, often natural, and has strong esoteric associations. Good fit.
4. **feng shui compass:** A tool for spatial arrangement and energy flow. Less about the material itself and more about its application.
5. **dreamcatcher:**  Made of natural materials and has a spiritual purpose, but leans more towards folklore and protection than the specific type of esoteric material in the examples.
6. **runestones:** Natural materials (stones) with esoteric/divinatory uses. Strong fit.
7. **incense stick:**  Made of natural materials with ritualistic/esoteric use. Good fit.
8. **quartz crystals:** Natural materials with widely recognized esoteric properties. Strong fit.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
