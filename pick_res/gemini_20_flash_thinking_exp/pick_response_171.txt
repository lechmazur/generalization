The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a linguistic pattern. The examples show reduplication in Indonesian and Malay to indicate plurality or a modified meaning. The anti-examples are past tense or different forms of verbs related to movement. The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific reduplication pattern observed in the examples, and *not* broader themes like verb forms or plurals in general.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **spoken**: This is a past participle of a verb. It doesn't fit the reduplication pattern. Score: Low.
2. **sleeping**: This is a present participle of a verb. It doesn't fit the reduplication pattern. Score: Low.
3. **broken**: This is a past participle of a verb. It doesn't fit the reduplication pattern. Score: Low.
4. **drinking**: This is a present participle of a verb. It doesn't fit the reduplication pattern. Score: Low.
5. **eats**: This is a third-person singular present tense verb. It doesn't fit the reduplication pattern. Score: Low.
6. **went**: This is the past tense of a verb. It doesn't fit the reduplication pattern. Score: Low.
7. **kain (cloth) - kain-kain (cloths) in Malay**: This perfectly matches the reduplication pattern for pluralization in Malay, just like the examples. Score: High.
8. **mice**: This is the irregular plural of "mouse" in English. It doesn't follow the reduplication pattern. Score: Low.

Now, let's assign granular scores, keeping in mind the need for nuance and avoiding polarization.

1. **spoken**:  Doesn't fit the pattern at all. Score: 1
2. **sleeping**: Doesn't fit the pattern at all. Score: 1
3. **broken**: Doesn't fit the pattern at all. Score: 1
4. **drinking**: Doesn't fit the pattern at all. Score: 1
5. **eats**: Doesn't fit the pattern at all. Score: 1
6. **went**: Doesn't fit the pattern at all. Score: 1
7. **kain (cloth) - kain-kain (cloths) in Malay**: Perfect match. Score: 10
8. **mice**:  Indicates plurality but not through reduplication. Score: 2 (slightly higher than the others because it relates to plurality, even if the mechanism is different).<number>1</number><score>1</score>
