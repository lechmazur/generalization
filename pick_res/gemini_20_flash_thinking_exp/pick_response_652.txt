The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples showcase textiles with cultural significance, specific symbolic meaning, and use in rituals or ceremonies. The anti-examples are items with broader cultural or decorative uses but lack the specific ritualistic and deeply symbolic textile aspect.

The task is to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding the broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples. I need to consider the following criteria when scoring:

- **Textile:** Is the candidate a textile?
- **Cultural Significance:** Does it have a clear cultural or traditional association?
- **Symbolic Meaning:** Does it carry specific symbolic meaning beyond mere decoration?
- **Ritualistic/Ceremonial Use:** Is it used in specific rituals or ceremonies?

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **A batik scarf with floral motifs:**  While a textile, the floral motifs might be more decorative than deeply symbolic in a cultural/ritualistic sense. Likely a lower score.
2. **A woven rug with abstract designs:**  A textile, but abstract designs might lack the specific cultural symbolism. Could be decorative. Likely a lower score.
3. **An intricately embroidered Hmong story cloth depicting the group's migration journey, used in wedding ceremonies:** This strongly aligns with the theme. It's a textile, has cultural significance (depicting migration), symbolic meaning (the journey), and ritualistic use (wedding ceremonies). Likely a high score.
4. **A crocheted blanket:** A textile, but often lacks deep cultural symbolism or specific ritualistic use. Likely a lower score.
5. **A quilt with a geometric pattern:** A textile, and geometric patterns can have symbolic meaning, but it might not be tied to a specific cultural ritual in the same way as the examples. Likely a mid-range score.
6. **A tapestry depicting a landscape:** A textile, but the focus on landscape makes it more decorative than ritually symbolic. Likely a lower score.
7. **A hand-painted silk fan:** While potentially artistic, it's not primarily a woven textile and might be more decorative. Likely a lower score.
8. **A macrame wall hanging:** A textile craft, but often lacks deep cultural symbolism or ritualistic use. Likely a lower score.

Now, let's assign specific scores, aiming for granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
