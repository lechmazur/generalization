The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are Abacus, Slide rule, and Napier's bones. These are all mechanical aids for calculation. The anti-examples are Logarithm table, Trigonometry table, and Adding machine. These are related to calculation but are either tables (not mechanical devices) or, in the case of the adding machine, a more advanced mechanical device.

The specific theme seems to be "pre-electronic mechanical aids for calculation".

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

1. Statistical software: This is software, not mechanical. Score: 0
2. Mechanical calculator: This is mechanical and for calculation. It fits the theme well. However, it's more advanced than the examples. Score: 8
3. Smartphone: This is electronic and not specifically for calculation in a mechanical way. Score: 0
4. Quantum computer: This is electronic and a computer, not a mechanical aid. Score: 0
5. Computer: This is electronic, not mechanical. Score: 0
6. Spreadsheet software: This is software, not mechanical. Score: 0
7. Graphing paper: This is a visual aid for representing data, not a direct calculation tool like the examples. Score: 2
8. Cash register: While some older cash registers were mechanical, their primary function is recording transactions, not general calculation. Score: 3<number>1</number><score>0</score>
