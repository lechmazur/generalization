The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific astronomical theme and wants me to score candidate astronomical objects based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are W Ursae Majoris, CM Draconis, and Algol. These are all types of eclipsing binary stars.

The anti-examples are Transit of an exoplanet (similar to eclipsing binary but the occulting object is a planet), Binary star with no eclipses (binary but no eclipses), and Cepheid variable (pulsating star, not an eclipsing binary).

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "eclipsing binary star".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the "eclipsing binary star" theme, avoiding broader interpretations like "binary star" or "variable star".

1. Mira variable: These are pulsating red giants. Not an eclipsing binary. Score: Low.
2. Cataclysmic variable star: This is a binary star system involving a white dwarf accreting matter. Some are eclipsing, some are not. Score: Moderate.
3. RS Canum Venaticorum variable: These are close binary star systems with enhanced chromospheric activity. They are often eclipsing. Score: High.
4. Rotating variable star: Variability is due to starspots or other surface features as the star rotates. Not an eclipsing binary. Score: Low.
5. RR Lyrae variable: These are pulsating horizontal branch stars. Not an eclipsing binary. Score: Low.
6. Pulsar: A highly magnetized, rotating neutron star or white dwarf that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation. Not an eclipsing binary. Score: Very low.
7. T Tauri star: A young pre-main sequence star. Not an eclipsing binary. Score: Very low.
8. Beta Lyrae: A prototype of a semi-detached eclipsing binary system. Score: Very high.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
