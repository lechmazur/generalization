The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples are oil reservoirs, coral reefs, and coal deposits. These are all geological formations that are significant for their resource potential or biological importance and are formed over long periods. The anti-examples are salt flats, river deltas, and rift valleys. These are also geological formations, but they are more about surface processes and landforms rather than resource deposits or specific biological ecosystems.

The specific theme seems to be geological formations that are significant for either their stored resources (oil, coal) or their unique biological ecosystems built upon geological structures (coral reefs).

The task is to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of general geological formations.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **limestone caves**: These are formed by the dissolution of limestone, a sedimentary rock. They can host unique ecosystems and are geological formations. They can sometimes be associated with oil and gas reservoirs. Score: 7

2. **canyons**: These are deep, narrow valleys with steep sides, usually formed by erosion. They are geological formations but don't fit the resource/ecosystem aspect as strongly. Score: 3

3. **fjords**: These are long, narrow inlets with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial activity. They are geological formations but don't directly fit the resource/ecosystem theme of the examples. Score: 2

4. **glaciers**: These are large masses of ice. While they shape the landscape, they are not geological formations in the same way as the examples. Score: 1

5. **mountains**: These are large landforms that rise significantly above the surrounding terrain. They are geological formations but are too broad and don't specifically align with the resource/ecosystem aspect. Score: 3

6. **plateaus**: These are large areas of flat land that are higher than the surrounding land. They are geological formations but don't strongly align with the resource/ecosystem theme. Score: 2

7. **sinkholes**: These are depressions in the ground caused by the collapse of underlying soluble rock. They are geological formations and can sometimes be associated with underground water systems, which can be linked to resource formation. Score: 5

8. **sand dunes**: These are accumulations of sand shaped by wind. They are geological formations but don't strongly fit the resource/ecosystem theme. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>7</score>
