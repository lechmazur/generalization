The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples (ketoret bowl, thurible, smudge stick) all relate to the burning of incense or fragrant materials for ritualistic or spiritual purposes. The anti-examples (sacred candle, sacred oils, meditation cushion) are related to spirituality but don't involve burning incense.

The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of burning incense/fragrant materials, avoiding the broader theme of general spiritual or ritualistic items.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **Divination cards:**  Not related to burning incense. Score: Low.
*   **Ritual chalice:**  Used for liquids, not burning. Score: Low.
*   **Prayer flags:**  Textile items, not related to burning. Score: Low.
*   **Singing bowl:**  Produces sound, not related to burning. Score: Low.
*   **Ritual bell:** Produces sound, not related to burning. Score: Low.
*   **Prayer beads:** Used for counting prayers, not related to burning. Score: Low.
*   **Prayer wheel:**  Mechanical device for repeating prayers, not related to burning. Score: Low.
*   **Copal burner:**  Specifically designed for burning copal (a resin), directly aligns with the theme. Score: High.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores using the full range, keeping in mind the need for nuanced grading.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
