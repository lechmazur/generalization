The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are "rescue tube", "ring buoy", and "life ring". These are all rigid or semi-rigid flotation devices, typically ring-shaped, that can be thrown to a person in the water. The anti-examples are "rescue float", "rescue can", and "life jacket". These are also flotation devices, but they are generally held onto or worn by the person.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be throwable ring-shaped flotation devices. I need to evaluate each candidate based on this.

1. **rescue board**:  Not ring-shaped, held onto. Lower score.
2. **inflatable raft**: Not ring-shaped, larger, for multiple people. Lower score.
3. **rescue sling**: Not rigid, more like a harness. Lower score.
4. **swim belt**: Worn, not throwable. Lower score.
5. **pool noodle**: Not rigid, not specifically designed for rescue. Lower score.
6. **rescue torpedo**:  Can be thrown, but not ring-shaped. Mid-range score.
7. **life preserver**:  A broader term, often refers to wearable devices. Lower score.
8. **flotation cushion**: Not ring-shaped, held onto. Lower score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
