The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Looking at the examples:
- cast iron skillet
- glass milk bottle
- kerosene lantern

These items seem to share the characteristic of being common household items from a time before widespread electricity and modern conveniences. They are functional and relatively simple in design.

Looking at the anti-examples:
- manual egg beater
- hand-cranked ice cream maker
- wind-up alarm clock

These items are also manual or mechanical but involve more complex mechanisms or moving parts compared to the examples. They represent a slightly more advanced level of technology or a different category of household items.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be simple, non-electrical household items from a pre-modern era.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. a rotary telephone:  While pre-modern, it's more complex than the examples and involves a specific technology.
2. a handwoven basket: Fits the theme well - simple, functional, and pre-modern.
3. a brass candlestick holder:  Fits the theme well - simple, functional, and pre-modern.
4. a sewing machine: More complex mechanically than the examples.
5. a metal lunchbox:  Could fit, depending on the era. Likely simpler than the anti-examples.
6. a horse-drawn plow:  Fits the pre-modern aspect but is not a household item in the same way.
7. a wooden rolling pin: Fits the theme well - simple, functional, and pre-modern.
8. a wooden rocking chair:  Fits the pre-modern aspect and is a household item, but slightly more complex in construction than the examples.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate, ensuring a range of values and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
