The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are castanets, maracas, and drumsticks. The anti-examples are a triangle, a gong, and a cymbal. The task is to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples suggest the theme is "hand-held percussion instruments that are struck or shaken to produce sound". The anti-examples are all struck percussion instruments, but they are generally larger and not typically hand-held in the same way as the examples.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **a bass drum**:  Large drum, usually played with a beater, not hand-held in the same way. Broader theme fit, but not specific.
2. **a steel drum**: Played with mallets, not typically hand-held in the same way. Broader theme fit.
3. **tambourine**: Can be shaken or struck, often hand-held. Good fit for the specific theme.
4. **a xylophone**: Played with mallets, not hand-held. Broader theme fit.
5. **a snare drum**: Usually played with drumsticks, not directly hand-held. Broader theme fit.
6. **a conga drum**: Played with hands, but larger and not typically shaken. Closer to the specific theme than some, but not a perfect match.
7. **a djembe**: Played with hands, similar to a conga.
8. **a bongo drum**: Played with hands, smaller and more hand-held than congas or djembes. Good fit.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range.

1. a bass drum: Low score, as it doesn't fit the hand-held aspect.
2. a steel drum: Low score, played with mallets, not directly hand-held.
3. tambourine: High score, fits the hand-held and struck/shaken criteria.
4. a xylophone: Low score, played with mallets, not hand-held.
5. a snare drum: Medium-low score, played with sticks, not directly hand-held.
6. a conga drum: Medium score, played with hands, but not typically shaken.
7. a djembe: Medium score, similar to a conga.
8. a bongo drum: High score, played with hands and hand-held.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
