The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are a coral reef, a dense forest, and a mountain range. The anti-examples are a cave, an atoll, and a fjord.

The examples share the characteristic of being large-scale, natural, and prominent geographical features formed by natural processes. The anti-examples, while also natural geographical features, differ in key aspects. A cave is an underground feature, an atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef (related but not the same), and a fjord is a narrow inlet carved by glaciers (related to mountains but not a mountain range itself).

The specific theme seems to be large-scale, above-ground, naturally formed geographical features with significant vertical relief or extent.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme:

1. **a volcanic crater:**  Can be large-scale and naturally formed, but the vertical relief is inward, unlike the examples. It's a depression rather than an elevation or extensive feature. Likely a lower score.
2. **a river delta:** Large-scale and naturally formed, but relatively flat compared to the examples. It's more of an accumulation than a distinct landform with significant vertical relief. Likely a mid-range score.
3. **a glacier:** Large-scale and naturally formed. While it can be associated with mountains, it's not a landform itself in the same way. It's a mass of ice. Likely a mid-range score.
4. **a peninsula:**  Can be large-scale and naturally formed. It's a landform extending into a body of water. The vertical relief might vary. Likely a mid-range score.
5. **a lagoon:**  A body of water separated from a larger body of water. Not a landform in the same way as the examples. Likely a lower score.
6. **a rift valley:** Large-scale and naturally formed, with significant vertical relief (downward). Shares some characteristics with the examples but is a depression. Likely a mid-range score.
7. **a sand dune system:** Can be large-scale and naturally formed. Has vertical relief. Shares some characteristics with the examples. Likely a higher score.
8. **a canyon:** Large-scale and naturally formed, with significant vertical relief (downward). Shares some characteristics with the examples but is a depression. Likely a mid-range score.

Let's refine the scores based on the nuance required.

1. **a volcanic crater:**  While naturally formed, it's a depression. Score: 3
2. **a river delta:** Large but flat. Score: 5
3. **a glacier:** Large but a mass of ice, not a landform in the same sense. Score: 4
4. **a peninsula:**  A landform, can be large. Score: 6
5. **a lagoon:**  A body of water. Score: 2
6. **a rift valley:** Large, but a depression. Score: 5
7. **a sand dune system:** Large, has relief. Score: 7
8. **a canyon:** Large, but a depression. Score: 6<number>1</number><score>3</score>
