The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- The Good Friday Agreement: A peace agreement ending conflict.
- South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission: A process of restorative justice after conflict.
- The Salt March: A non-violent protest against injustice.

Anti-examples:
- The Oslo Accords: A peace agreement, but focused on negotiation and political solutions.
- The Cuban Missile Crisis resolution: A diplomatic resolution to a crisis, avoiding conflict.
- The Camp David Accords: A peace treaty negotiated between nations.

The specific theme seems to be about **non-violent conflict resolution or addressing past injustices through non-violent means, often involving a societal shift or reconciliation process**. The anti-examples involve negotiation and diplomacy, but not necessarily the same element of addressing deep-seated societal conflict or injustice through non-violent means.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.

1. **The United Nations peacekeeping missions**:  Sometimes involve non-violent intervention, but also can involve military action. Doesn't perfectly fit the "non-violent" aspect of the theme.
2. **The Nuremberg Trials**:  A judicial process after conflict, focused on accountability and punishment, not reconciliation or non-violent action.
3. **The Helsinki Accords**:  Focused on reducing tensions between the Eastern and Western blocs, primarily through diplomatic means and recognition of borders. Less about internal societal conflict resolution.
4. **The Dayton Agreement**:  A peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, primarily through negotiation and political settlement.
5. **The fall of the Berlin Wall through peaceful protests**:  A clear example of non-violent action leading to a significant societal shift.
6. **The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty**:  A diplomatic agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Not directly related to internal conflict resolution or addressing past injustices.
7. **The Paris Peace Accords**:  Ended the Vietnam War through negotiation and political settlement.
8. **The League of Nations formation**:  An international organization aimed at preventing future wars through diplomacy and collective security.
