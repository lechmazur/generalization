The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The anti-examples are crucial for understanding the nuances of the theme.

Examples: Annie Lennox, Kate Bush, Madonna
Anti-examples: Grace Jones, Debbie Harry, Pat Benatar

Let's analyze the examples:
- All are female singers.
- All achieved significant popularity in the 1980s.
- All are known for their distinctive and often theatrical stage presence and music videos.
- All have a strong element of art-pop or new wave in their music, though Madonna leans more towards pop.
- All have a certain level of avant-garde or experimentalism in their work, even within a pop context.

Now let's analyze the anti-examples:
- Grace Jones: While theatrical and popular in the 80s, her music is more heavily influenced by disco, funk, and reggae. Her style is more overtly edgy and less pop-oriented in the same way as the examples.
- Debbie Harry (Blondie):  While new wave and popular in the 80s, Blondie's sound is often more straightforward rock/pop, less theatrical and experimental than the examples.
- Pat Benatar: Primarily a rock artist with a powerful voice, less emphasis on theatricality and art-pop elements compared to the examples.

The specific theme seems to be "female singers prominent in the 1980s known for their art-pop/new wave influences, theatricality, and distinctive visual style."

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Bonnie Tyler: Known for her powerful, raspy voice and rock ballads. Less art-pop/new wave, more straightforward rock.
2. Janet Jackson: While hugely popular in the 80s, her music leans more towards R&B, funk, and pop. Less theatrical and art-pop than the examples.
3. Cher:  A long-standing artist, had a significant 80s presence with a more rock/pop sound. While visually distinctive, less aligned with the specific art-pop/new wave theatricality.
4. David Bowie: Male artist, immediately a mismatch. While theatrical and influential, doesn't fit the "female singer" aspect.
5. Stevie Nicks (Fleetwood Mac):  While popular in the 80s and visually distinctive, her music is more rooted in rock and folk-rock. Less art-pop/new wave.
6. Whitney Houston: Primarily a pop and R&B singer. Less theatrical and art-pop/new wave.
7. Cyndi Lauper: Fits the theme well. Popular in the 80s, new wave/pop sound, distinctive visual style, and a degree of theatricality.
8. Tina Turner: While popular in the 80s and a powerful performer, her music is more rooted in rock and soul. Less art-pop/new wave.
