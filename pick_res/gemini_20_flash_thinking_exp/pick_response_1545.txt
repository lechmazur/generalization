The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples. The core of the theme seems to be about navigating a physical space by solving a sequence of puzzles to progress. The anti-examples highlight that the puzzles must be integral to the progression through the space, not just ancillary activities within it.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a better match to the specific theme. I should avoid simply giving 0s or 10s and use the full range to reflect nuances.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1:** Puzzle-solving is present, but it doesn't gate the dining experience or movement. Likely a low score.
*   **Candidate 2:** Puzzles are part of the storyline, but not required for the ride's progression. Likely a low score.
*   **Candidate 3:**  Maze-like structure and solving puzzles to unlock new sections strongly align with the theme. Likely a high score.
*   **Candidate 4:** Riddles are present, but not necessary for exploration. Likely a low score.
*   **Candidate 5:** Puzzles are part of the decor, but not required for using the room. Likely a low score.
*   **Candidate 6:** Puzzles are for winning prizes, not for navigating the set. Likely a low score.
*   **Candidate 7:** Interactive puzzles exist, but don't unlock new spaces. Likely a low score.
*   **Candidate 8:** Puzzle sculptures don't gate access to new areas. Likely a low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
