The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all types of kites: box kite, diamond kite, parafoil kite.
The anti-examples are related to flight but are not kites: paraglider, parachute, hang glider.

The specific theme seems to be "unpowered heavier-than-air flying objects tethered by a string".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A rokkaku kite:** This is a type of kite. It fits the theme.
2. **A hot air balloon:** This is powered and not tethered by a string in the same way as a kite.
3. **A frisbee:** This is unpowered and heavier than air, but not tethered.
4. **A kite string without a kite:** This is part of a kite but not the kite itself.
5. **A helium balloon on a string:** This is lighter than air.
6. **A paper airplane:** This is unpowered and heavier than air, but not typically tethered.
7. **A boomerang:** This is unpowered and heavier than air, but not tethered.
8. **A blimp:** This is powered and not tethered in the same way as a kite.

Now I will assign scores from 0 to 10 based on how well each candidate matches the specific theme.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>3</score>
<number>5</number><score>0</score>
<number>6</number><score>2</score>
<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>1</score>
