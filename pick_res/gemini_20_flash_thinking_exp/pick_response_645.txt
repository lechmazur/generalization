The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by the initial examples, while explicitly avoiding matching a broader theme suggested by the anti-examples.

The core elements of the specific theme are:
- A supernatural entity associated with a specific natural location or element.
- The entity provides aid or protection to those who respect or follow certain rules related to that location/element.
- The entity punishes or harms those who disrespect or break those rules.

The anti-examples broaden this by:
- Shifting the focus from natural locations/elements to more abstract concepts like promises or betrayal.
- Maintaining the duality of aid/protection and punishment/harm based on adherence to rules.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on the presence of the specific theme's elements and the absence of the broader theme's elements.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

1. **a mountain troll that protects travelers but punishes those who exploit the land:**  Matches the specific theme well (mountain location, protection for respect, punishment for disrespect).
2. **a witch who curses intruders but heals those who seek her aid:**  Closer to the broader theme (less tied to a specific natural location, more about actions towards the witch).
3. **a banshee whose wail foretells death but warns the innocent:**  Doesn't fit the pattern of aid/punishment based on respect/disrespect of a location or element.
4. **a unicorn that heals the pure but attacks the corrupt:**  More aligned with the broader theme (abstract concepts of purity and corruption).
5. **a kraken that sinks ships but spares those who honor the sea:**  Strong match to the specific theme (sea location, punishment for disrespect, sparing for respect).
6. **a ghost that haunts a house but helps its former family:**  Doesn't strongly fit the pattern of a natural location or element and the rules are more personal.
7. **a siren that lures sailors but spares those who resist her song:**  Has a natural element (sea), but the condition is about resisting, not necessarily respecting the sea itself. Leans towards the broader theme.
8. **a dragon that hoards treasure but spares those who offer gifts:**  The condition is about offering gifts, not necessarily respecting the dragon's domain. Leans towards the broader theme.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
