The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are 'farrier's knife', 'hoof pick', and 'hoof nipper'. These are all tools specifically used for trimming and maintaining horse hooves. The anti-examples are 'hoof oil', 'curry comb', and 'horse brush'. These are related to horse care but are not specifically for hoof trimming.

The task is to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of hoof trimming tools, not just general horse grooming.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **shedding blade**: Used for removing loose hair. Related to horse care but not hoof trimming.
2. **mane comb**: Used for grooming the mane. Related to horse care but not hoof trimming.
3. **detangling comb**: Used for removing tangles from hair. Related to horse care but not hoof trimming.
4. **grooming mitt**: A glove-like tool for general grooming. Related to horse care but not hoof trimming.
5. **tail brush**: Used for grooming the tail. Related to horse care but not hoof trimming.
6. **grooming brush**: A general brush for horse care. Related to horse care but not hoof trimming.
7. **body brush**: A brush for general cleaning of the horse's body. Related to horse care but not hoof trimming.
8. **hoof rasp**: A tool used for smoothing and shaping hooves after trimming. This is directly related to hoof trimming.

Based on this analysis, 'hoof rasp' is the only candidate that directly fits the specific theme. The others are related to general horse grooming.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
