The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples: Clay object, submerged in water (lake, ocean, river), for a cultural/art/religious purpose.
Anti-examples: Different material (metal, stone, wood), submerged in water (river, ocean, lake), for a cultural/ritual/art purpose.

The specific theme seems to be: **A clay object submerged in a body of water for a cultural, artistic, or religious purpose.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it matches this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Candidate 1: Plastic sculpture, river, environmental project. Material is wrong. Purpose is related but not the same.
Candidate 2: Clay figure, pond, traditional ritual. Material is correct. Location is similar. Purpose is similar.
Candidate 3: Ceramic vase, pond, cultural event. Material is similar. Location is similar. Purpose is similar.
Candidate 4: Stone statue, river, memorial service. Material is wrong. Location is similar. Purpose is related.
Candidate 5: Glass sculpture, pond, art exhibition. Material is wrong. Location is similar. Purpose is similar.
Candidate 6: Stone monument, lake, historical commemoration. Material is wrong. Location is similar. Purpose is related.
Candidate 7: Ceramic tile, river, community project. Material is similar. Location is similar. Purpose is related.
Candidate 8: Glass bottle, sea, art piece. Material is wrong. Location is similar. Purpose is similar.

Let's assign scores based on the match to the specific theme:

- Material (clay): Strong positive. Ceramic is close. Other materials are negative.
- Location (lake, ocean, river): Strong positive. Pond is close. Sea is similar.
- Purpose (art installation, cultural ceremony, religious festival): Strong positive. Traditional ritual, cultural event are close. Environmental project, memorial service, historical commemoration, community project, art piece are related but not exact.

Candidate 1: Wrong material, right location, related purpose. Low score.
Candidate 2: Right material, close location, close purpose. High score.
Candidate 3: Similar material, close location, close purpose. Good score.
Candidate 4: Wrong material, right location, related purpose. Low score.
