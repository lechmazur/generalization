The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples:
- Phonautograph: An early sound recording device that visually recorded sound waves.
- Electric guitar: An instrument that uses electromagnetic pickups to convert string vibrations into electrical signals.
- Magnetic tape recording: A method of storing audio signals on a magnetic medium.

Anti-examples:
- Gramophone: A device for playing back recorded sound.
- Radio: A technology for wireless transmission of signals.
- Telephone: A device for transmitting voice over long distances.

The specific theme seems to be about the *creation and capture* of sound signals in a *physical or electrical* form, focusing on the *recording* aspect. The anti-examples are related to sound but focus on *playback, transmission, or communication* rather than the initial capture/recording.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Noise-cancelling headphones:** These *process* existing audio signals to reduce noise. They don't inherently *capture* or *record* sound. Likely a low score.
2. **Electronic music synthesizers:** These *create* sounds electronically. While related to audio, they aren't primarily about *capturing* real-world sounds. A moderate score, leaning lower.
3. **Microphone:** This *captures* sound and converts it into an electrical signal. This aligns very well with the theme. High score.
4. **Audio compression algorithms:** These *process* existing audio data to reduce file size. They don't *capture* sound. Low score.
5. **Surround sound systems:** These focus on the *playback* and spatial distribution of audio. They don't *capture* sound. Low score.
6. **Stereo sound:** This is about *recording and reproducing* sound from multiple sources to create a sense of space. While it involves recording, the focus is also on reproduction. Moderate score.
7. **Digital audio workstations (DAWs):** These are software environments for *recording, editing, and producing* audio. They involve recording as a core function. High score.
8. **Cochlear implant:** This is a medical device that *transmits* sound information directly to the auditory nerve, bypassing damaged parts of the ear. It's about *hearing restoration*, not sound capture or recording. Low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
