The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest a biological transformation or a life cycle stage ending with a significant change.
Anti-examples suggest the end of a functional lifespan or a change due to external factors.

The specific theme seems to be a natural, biological transformation that is part of a life cycle, often involving a loss of a previous form or function to enable a new stage.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

1. **A bridge being closed for safety reasons after years of use:** This is similar to the anti-examples (end of functional lifespan).
2. **A species going extinct due to environmental changes:** This is a biological change, but driven by external factors, not a natural part of a life cycle.
3. **A language evolving and losing certain words over time:** This is a change over time, but not biological.
4. **A seed losing its protective coat after germinating into a plant:** This is a natural, biological transformation as part of a life cycle.
5. **A snake shedding its skin:** This is a natural, biological process, but it's a cyclical renewal rather than a transformation into a new stage.
6. **A star collapsing into a black hole:** This is a physical transformation, but not biological.
7. **A tradition fading away as society changes:** This is a societal change, not biological.
8. **A person retiring after a long career:** This is the end of a functional period, similar to the anti-examples.

Now I will assign scores based on the degree of match to the specific theme.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
