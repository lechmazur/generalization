The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Wind turbine", "Gyroscope", and "Spinning top". These all involve rotation around an axis. The anti-examples are "torus", "cylinder", and "cone". These are all 3D geometric shapes, but they don't necessarily involve active rotation in their definition.

The specific theme seems to be "objects that are designed to spin or rotate around an axis". The broader theme that the anti-examples fit into is "3D geometric shapes".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme of "objects designed to spin or rotate around an axis", while avoiding the broader theme of just being a 3D shape.

1. **cube**: A cube is a 3D shape, but it's not inherently designed to spin. Score: 1
2. **Ferris wheel**: A Ferris wheel is designed to rotate around an axis. Score: 9
3. **pentagonal prism**: A pentagonal prism is a 3D shape, not inherently designed to spin. Score: 1
4. **octahedron**: An octahedron is a 3D shape, not inherently designed to spin. Score: 1
5. **icosahedron**: An icosahedron is a 3D shape, not inherently designed to spin. Score: 1
6. **paraboloid**: A paraboloid is a 3D shape. While it *can* be rotated to generate the shape, the object itself isn't necessarily designed to spin in its function. Score: 3
7. **hexagonal prism**: A hexagonal prism is a 3D shape, not inherently designed to spin. Score: 1
8. **ellipsoid**: An ellipsoid is a 3D shape. Similar to a paraboloid, it can be formed by rotation, but the object itself isn't necessarily designed to spin in its function. Score: 3<number>1</number><score>1</score>
