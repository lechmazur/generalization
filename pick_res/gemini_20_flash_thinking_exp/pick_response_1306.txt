The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The specific theme appears to be about fundamental forces acting at a distance between two objects. The anti-examples represent broader concepts that are not direct forces between two objects.

The task is to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, using a scale of 0 to 10. I need to avoid being misled by the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of how each candidate aligns with the specific theme:

*   **Pressure difference across a semipermeable membrane:** This involves a force, but it's a macroscopic force arising from the collective motion of molecules, not a fundamental force acting at a distance between two specific objects.
*   **Cause and effect:** This is a very broad concept and not related to fundamental forces.
*   **Symbiotic relationship between two organisms:** This involves biological interactions, not fundamental forces.
*   **Economic trade between two countries:** This is a social and economic interaction, not a fundamental force.
*   **Cultural diffusion:** This is a social and cultural phenomenon, not a fundamental force.
*   **A family bond:** This is a social and emotional connection, not a fundamental force.
*   **Competition between businesses:** This is an economic interaction, not a fundamental force.
*   **A food web:** This describes ecological relationships, not fundamental forces acting directly between two objects.

Based on this analysis, most candidates will score low. However, I need to use the full range of scores and provide nuanced grading.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>0</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
