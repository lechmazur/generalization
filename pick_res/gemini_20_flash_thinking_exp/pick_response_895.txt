The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and ensure the anti-examples do not fit this specific theme.

Examples: The Great Oak, Mount Everest, The Ocean
Anti-examples: Volcanoes, Redwood trees, A rainbow

The examples seem to represent large, natural, enduring features of the Earth. The anti-examples, while natural, are either processes (volcanoes, rainbow) or a specific type of the broader category (redwood trees are trees, but the Great Oak is more general).

The specific theme seems to be **large, singular, natural geographical features or entities**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes that the anti-examples might fit into.

1. The Aurora Borealis: A natural phenomenon, not a geographical feature. Broader theme: natural phenomena.
2. Lightning bolts: A natural phenomenon, not a geographical feature. Broader theme: weather events.
3. Hurricanes: A natural phenomenon, not a geographical feature. Broader theme: weather events.
4. The Grand Canyon: A large, singular, natural geographical feature.
5. Waterfalls: A natural geographical feature, but less singular and more of a process.
6. Glaciers: A large, natural geographical feature.
7. The North Star: A celestial object, not a terrestrial geographical feature. Broader theme: celestial objects.
8. Meteor showers: A celestial phenomenon, not a geographical feature. Broader theme: celestial events.

Now I will assign scores from 0 to 10 based on the fit to the specific theme.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>9</score>
<number>5</number><score>6</score>
<number>6</number><score>8</score>
<number>7</number><score>0</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
