The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme from the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit *that specific theme*, while explicitly avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (obsidian mirror, divining bones, singing bowl) all seem to be tools or objects used for divination or spiritual insight. They are often personal or used by a single practitioner.

The anti-examples (ritual mask, ritual drum, ceremonial staff) are also related to ritual and ceremony, but they tend to be more public, communal, or associated with a leader or performer.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **objects used for personal divination or spiritual insight**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **temple bell**: While used in a sacred space, it's more for calling to prayer or marking time, not personal divination. Likely a lower score.
2. **baptismal font**: Used in a ritual of initiation, communal. Doesn't fit the personal divination aspect. Likely a low score.
3. **blessing oil**: Used for anointing, often communal or by a religious figure. Not directly for personal divination. Likely a low score.
4. **ceremonial rattle**: Similar to the anti-examples, used in public ceremonies. Not for personal divination. Likely a low score.
5. **communion chalice**: Used in a communal religious ritual. Not for personal divination. Likely a low score.
6. **sacred vessel**: This is quite broad. It *could* be used for divination, but it's not inherently so. Needs careful consideration.
7. **ceremonial sword**:  Similar to the anti-examples, associated with leadership or performance in a ceremony. Not for personal divination. Likely a low score.
8. **holy water**: Used in blessings and rituals, often communal. Not directly for personal divination. Likely a low score.

Let's refine the scores, considering the nuances:

1. **temple bell**:  While not for *personal* divination, it can be seen as a tool for spiritual connection. Perhaps a slightly higher score than the purely ceremonial items.
2. **baptismal font**:  Strongly associated with communal ritual, very low match.
3. **blessing oil**:  Has a personal aspect in anointing, but not for divination.
4. **ceremonial rattle**:  Clearly in the anti-example category.
5. **communion chalice**:  Strongly communal, low match.
6. **sacred vessel**:  The ambiguity allows for a slightly higher score than the clearly non-matching items. It *could* hold divining tools.
7. **ceremonial sword**:  Clearly in the anti-example category.
8. **holy water**:  Has a personal use, but not for divination.

Final scoring plan:
- Items clearly in the anti-example category (communal ritual objects) will get very low scores.
- Items with a slight personal/spiritual connection but not divination will get slightly higher scores.
- Ambiguous items that *could* fit the theme will get mid-range scores.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
