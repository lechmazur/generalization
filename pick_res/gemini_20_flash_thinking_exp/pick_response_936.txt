The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples:
- Treaty of Versailles: Post-WWI treaty, involving major powers, redrawing borders and establishing reparations.
- Camp David Accords: Peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, brokered by the US.
- Treaty of Tordesillas: Agreement between Spain and Portugal dividing newly discovered lands.

Anti-examples:
- Good Friday Agreement: Agreement related to Northern Ireland's political status.
- Helsinki Accords: Agreement on human rights and cooperation during the Cold War.
- North Atlantic Treaty: Military alliance treaty.

The specific theme seems to be **major international treaties that significantly reshaped geopolitical landscapes or resolved major international conflicts, often involving territorial adjustments or the establishment of new international orders.** The anti-examples are international agreements but focus on more specific regional issues, human rights, or military alliances, rather than broad geopolitical restructuring.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. Schengen Agreement: Focuses on border control and free movement within Europe. Related to international cooperation but not a major geopolitical reshaper in the same vein as the examples.
2. Geneva Convention: Deals with the treatment of civilians and prisoners of war during wartime. Important international law but not about redrawing borders or establishing new international orders.
3. Maastricht Treaty: Established the European Union and the Euro. Significant for European integration but less about resolving major international conflicts or redrawing global maps in the same way as the examples.
4. Magna Carta:  A foundational document for English law, limiting the power of the monarch. Not an international treaty in the same sense as the examples.
5. Peace of Westphalia: Ended the Thirty Years' War and established the modern state system. This seems like a strong match.
6. Charter of the United Nations: Established the UN and the framework for international cooperation. A major international agreement establishing a new international order.
7. United Nations Charter: This is the same as candidate 6.
8. Lisbon Treaty: Amended the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community. Focuses on European integration, less about major geopolitical shifts in the broader sense.
