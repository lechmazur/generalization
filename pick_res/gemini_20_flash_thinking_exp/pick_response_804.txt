The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific historical theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (Meiji Restoration, Norman Conquest, Bolshevik Revolution) all involve a relatively rapid and significant shift in power and societal structure, often involving violence or the threat of violence, and leading to a new regime or order. They are distinct from gradual changes or long-term processes.

The anti-examples (French Revolution, Arab Spring, American Civil War) are also significant shifts, but they highlight broader themes:
- French Revolution:  A revolution driven by Enlightenment ideals and popular uprising.
- Arab Spring: A series of popular uprisings across multiple countries.
- American Civil War: A conflict focused on secession and slavery.

The specific theme seems to be a relatively swift, decisive shift in power and societal structure, often involving a foreign element or a distinct internal faction seizing control.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **The Reagan Revolution:**  More of a political and economic shift within an existing system, not a fundamental regime change. Lower score.
2. **The Vietnam War:** A prolonged conflict, not a swift shift in power within a single entity. Lower score.
3. **The Opium Wars:** Involved foreign intervention and had significant consequences, but didn't result in a complete internal regime change in the same way as the examples. Moderate score.
4. **The Industrial Revolution:** A long-term process of technological and societal change, not a rapid political shift. Lower score.
5. **The Cold War:** A period of geopolitical tension, not a specific internal power shift in a single state. Lower score.
6. **The Fall of Constantinople:** A decisive conquest leading to a new regime. Strong match.
7. **The Partition of India:** A significant and relatively rapid redrawing of borders and transfer of power, though perhaps less of an internal societal restructuring than the examples. Moderate to high score.
8. **The Protestant Reformation:** A major religious and social upheaval, but a more gradual and diffuse process than the examples. Moderate score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
