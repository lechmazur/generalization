The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific mathematical theme. I need to identify this specific theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (Hermite polynomials, Bessel functions, Airy function) are all special functions that are solutions to second-order linear ordinary differential equations. They often arise in physics and engineering problems.

The anti-examples (Chebyshev polynomials, Legendre polynomials, Gamma function) are also special functions. Chebyshev and Legendre polynomials are solutions to second-order linear ODEs, but they are polynomial solutions on a finite interval. The Gamma function is a generalization of the factorial function. The key difference seems to be the nature of the solutions and the types of differential equations they satisfy. The examples are solutions to differential equations with variable coefficients, often leading to non-polynomial solutions. The anti-examples, while also solutions to second-order linear ODEs, are polynomial solutions on a finite interval. The Gamma function is different altogether.

Let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Divergence theorem: This is a theorem in vector calculus relating the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the divergence of the field in the volume enclosed. It's not a special function.
2. Green's theorem: This is a theorem relating a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C. It's not a special function.
3. Stokes' theorem: This is a theorem about the integration of differential forms on manifolds, which generalizes several theorems from vector calculus. It's not a special function.
4. Cauchy's integral theorem: This is a central statement in complex analysis concerning the path integral of a holomorphic function over a closed curve in the complex plane. It's not a special function.
5. Laplace transform: This is an integral transform that converts a function of a real variable t (usually time) to a function of a complex variable s (frequency). It's a transformation, not a special function of the same type as the examples.
6. Beta function: This is a special function related to the Gamma function. It's an integral representation.
7. Laguerre polynomials: These are a family of orthogonal polynomials that are solutions to Laguerre's differential equation. They are similar to the anti-examples in being polynomial solutions.
8. Fourier series: This is a way to represent a periodic function as a sum of sine and cosine waves. It's a representation, not a special function of the same type as the examples.

Based on this analysis, the candidates that are special functions are the Beta function and Laguerre polynomials. Laguerre polynomials are more similar to the anti-examples. The Beta function is related to the Gamma function. The theorems and transforms are not the same type of object as the examples.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
