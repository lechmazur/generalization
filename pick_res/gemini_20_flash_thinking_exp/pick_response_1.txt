The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples all involve a spiral shape within a larger context (mythology, architecture, nature/tool). The anti-examples are all flat, two-dimensional objects. The task is to score eight candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding the broader theme suggested by the anti-examples (flatness).

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **a flat screen TV**: This is flat, like the anti-examples. It doesn't have a spiral.
2. **a square painting**: This is flat, like the anti-examples. It doesn't have a spiral.
3. **a flat board game**: This is flat, like the anti-examples. It doesn't have a spiral.
4. **a rectangular photograph**: This is flat, like the anti-examples. It doesn't have a spiral.
5. **the spiral-bound notebook used for writing stories**: This has a spiral binding. The stories connect to the "mythological tale" aspect of the first example, but the core element is the spiral.
6. **a flat map**: This is flat, like the anti-examples. It doesn't have a spiral.
7. **a flat smartphone screen**: This is flat, like the anti-examples. It doesn't have a spiral.
8. **a straight line of text**: This is linear, not spiral, and flat.

Based on this analysis, the key element of the specific theme is the presence of a spiral. The candidates that are flat will score low. The candidate with a spiral will score higher.

Here's a preliminary scoring:

1. Flat screen TV: 0
2. Square painting: 0
3. Flat board game: 0
4. Rectangular photograph: 0
5. Spiral-bound notebook: 8 (strong presence of a spiral)
6. Flat map: 0
7. Flat smartphone screen: 0
8. Straight line of text: 0

Let's refine the scoring to ensure granularity. While most candidates are clearly 0, the spiral notebook isn't a perfect match to the examples. The examples have a spiral *within* something else, whereas the notebook *is* bound by a spiral. This is a subtle difference.

Revised scoring:

1. Flat screen TV: 0
2. Square painting: 0
3. Flat board game: 0
4. Rectangular photograph: 0
5. Spiral-bound notebook: 7 (spiral is present, but the context is slightly different)
6. Flat map: 0
7. Flat smartphone screen: 0
8. Straight line of text: 0<number>1</number><score>0</score>
