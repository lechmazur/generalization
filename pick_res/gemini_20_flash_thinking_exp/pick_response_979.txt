The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score new candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not broader related themes.

The examples (scrying bowl, black mirror, crystal ball) all involve a reflective or translucent object used for divination or seeing things not normally visible. They are passive objects, requiring the user to look into them.

The anti-examples (ouija board, tarot cards, crystal skull) involve tools for divination but are more active or symbolic. A ouija board requires interaction, tarot cards are interpreted symbols, and a crystal skull, while made of crystal, is more of an object with potential power than a viewing tool.

I need to evaluate the candidates based on whether they fit the "reflective/translucent object for passive viewing/divination" criteria.

Here's a breakdown of the candidates:

*   **crystal pendant:** Could be translucent, but not primarily for viewing. More decorative or potentially for focusing energy.
*   **crystal pyramid:**  Could be translucent, but the shape isn't inherently for viewing. More about energy or structure.
*   **magic wand:** Not reflective or translucent. An active tool for casting spells.
*   **crystal cluster:**  Not a single, formed object for viewing. More of a natural formation.
*   **pendulum:**  Used for divination, but through movement, not viewing.
*   **amulet:**  An object for protection or luck, not viewing.
*   **runes:**  Symbolic objects for divination, not for viewing.
*   **obsidian disk:**  Dark and potentially reflective, similar to a black mirror.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
