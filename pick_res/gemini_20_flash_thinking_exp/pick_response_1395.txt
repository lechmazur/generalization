The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they match the specific theme, not a broader one.

Let's analyze the examples:
- Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research: Focus on medical research, named after an individual.
- W. K. Kellogg Foundation: Foundation, named after an individual.
- Carnegie Institution of Washington: Institution, named after an individual, focus on research.

The anti-examples:
- Howard Hughes Medical Institute: Focus on medical research, named after an individual.
- Wellcome Trust: Trust, named after a company/individual.
- Ford Foundation: Foundation, named after a family/company.

The specific theme seems to be: **Philanthropic organizations focused on scientific research, established in the early to mid-20th century, and named after an individual.**

Now let's evaluate the candidates:
1. Russell Sage Foundation: Established in 1907, named after an individual, focuses on social and economic research. Seems like a good match.
2. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution: Focuses on oceanographic research, not named after an individual.
3. Max Planck Society: German research organization, named after an individual but not a foundation in the same way.
4. CERN: European research organization focused on physics, not named after an individual.
5. Salk Institute for Biological Studies: Focuses on biological research, named after an individual.
6. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Focuses on various global issues, named after individuals, but more recent.
7. National Institutes of Health: Government agency, not named after an individual.
8. Chan Zuckerberg Initiative: Focuses on various areas including science, named after a couple, more recent.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
