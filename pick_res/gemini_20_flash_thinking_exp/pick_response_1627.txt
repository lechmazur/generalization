The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify this specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches it, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

The examples all involve:
- **Cellular organisms** (or in the case of myxobacteria, bacterial colonies acting as a multicellular unit)
- **Aggregation or collective behavior**
- **A change in form or behavior** as a result of this aggregation (slug, bioluminescence, fruiting body)
- **A response to an internal or density-dependent signal** (quorum sensing, developmental program)

The anti-examples involve:
- **Individual organisms** (bacteria, ants, spermatozoa)
- **Movement towards an external stimulus** (food, pheromones, egg)
- **No significant change in form or behavior** as a result of the movement.

Therefore, the specific theme is **cellular aggregation driven by internal or density-dependent signals, leading to a change in form or behavior**.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **A school of krill migrating**:  Involves aggregation and movement, but driven by external factors (food, breeding grounds) rather than internal signals leading to a change in form. Broader theme: collective movement.
2. **Fish schooling**: Similar to krill, driven by external factors (predator avoidance, foraging). Broader theme: collective behavior.
3. **Birds flocking**: Similar to fish, driven by external factors (migration, foraging). Broader theme: collective behavior.
4. **Slime mold growing on a decaying log**: This is very close to the *Dictyostelium* example. It involves cellular aggregation and a change in form (though not necessarily the slug stage). The aggregation is triggered by starvation, an internal signal.
5. **Neutrophils migrating towards a site of infection**: Individual cells moving towards an external signal (chemokines). Broader theme: chemotaxis.
6. **A flock of sheep moving across a field**:  Driven by external factors (herding, food). Broader theme: collective movement.
7. **Cancer cells metastasizing**: Individual cells moving and establishing new colonies, but not a coordinated aggregation leading to a specific form change driven by internal signals. Broader theme: cell migration.
8. **Paramecia moving towards a light source**: Individual cells moving towards an external stimulus. Broader theme: phototaxis.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
