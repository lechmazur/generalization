The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples seem to focus on individual inventors or small teams creating a groundbreaking invention that fundamentally changed a field.

The anti-examples seem to focus on large-scale, government-funded projects with many contributors and a significant national or global impact.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely: **Individual or small team invention of a groundbreaking technology that fundamentally changed a field.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Development of radar technology:**  While impactful, it was a more collaborative effort, especially during wartime. Likely a lower score.
2. **The development of penicillin:**  While a scientific discovery, it involved a more gradual process and multiple contributors. Might be a mid-range score.
3. **Development of the polio vaccine:**  Primarily associated with Jonas Salk, fitting the individual inventor aspect. Likely a higher score.
4. **Creation of the World Wide Web:**  Largely attributed to Tim Berners-Lee, fitting the individual inventor aspect. Likely a higher score.
5. **Development of GPS technology:**  A large-scale, government-funded project. Likely a lower score.
6. **The first nuclear reactor:**  A large-scale, collaborative scientific and engineering project. Likely a lower score.
7. **The first artificial satellite:**  A large-scale, government-funded project. Likely a lower score.
8. **Alexander Graham Bell's first telephone transmission:**  Fits the individual inventor creating a groundbreaking technology. Likely a higher score.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
