The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme.
The examples are all about naming extinct animals (dinosaur, fossilized mammal, ancient reptile) after famous entertainers (Elvis Presley, John Lennon, Audrey Hepburn).
The anti-examples involve naming recently extinct or living organisms after people from different professions (poet, sculptor, chef). This highlights that the specific theme is about extinct animals and entertainers.

Now, I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme: naming an extinct animal after a famous entertainer.

Candidate 1: a recently discovered spider named after a filmmaker - Spider is an animal, filmmaker is an entertainer. However, "recently discovered" implies it's not extinct.
Candidate 2: a modern mammal named after a famous athlete - Mammal is an animal, athlete is a celebrity but not necessarily an entertainer. Modern implies not extinct.
Candidate 3: a modern insect named after a fictional character - Insect is an animal. Fictional character is not a real person. Modern implies not extinct.
Candidate 4: a modern crustacean named after a composer - Crustacean is an animal, composer is an entertainer. Modern implies not extinct.
Candidate 5: a prehistoric bird named after Marilyn Monroe - Bird is an animal, Marilyn Monroe is a famous entertainer. Prehistoric implies extinct. This is a strong match.
Candidate 6: a newly identified fungus named after a musician - Fungus is not an animal. Musician is an entertainer.
Candidate 7: a living bird named after a scientist - Bird is an animal. Scientist is not an entertainer. Living implies not extinct.
Candidate 8: a recently discovered fish named after a politician - Fish is an animal. Politician is not an entertainer. Recently discovered implies not extinct.

Let's assign scores based on these considerations:
- Extinct animal named after an entertainer: 10
- Extinct animal named after a non-entertainer: 7-8
- Living animal named after an entertainer: 5-6
- Living animal named after a non-entertainer: 2-4
- Non-animal named after an entertainer: 1-2
- Animal named after a fictional character: 0-1<number>1</number><score>4</score>
