The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples all contain the name of a precious metal or gem followed by the word "Beach". The anti-examples contain the name of a common metal or material followed by the word "Beach". The task is to evaluate a list of candidate beach names based on how well they fit the specific theme (precious metal/gem + "Beach") and not the broader theme (material + "Beach").

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Coral Sand Beach, Maldives**: Contains "Coral", which is a gem, but also "Sand". The specific theme is precious metal/gem + "Beach". The presence of "Sand" makes it less of a direct match.
2. **Pebble Beach, California**: Contains "Pebble", which is a common geological material. This aligns more with the anti-examples.
3. **Sandstone Beach, California**: Contains "Sandstone", a common geological material. This aligns more with the anti-examples.
4. **Coral Beach, Cyprus**: Contains "Coral", which is a gem, followed by "Beach". This is a strong match to the specific theme.
5. **Seashell Beach, Florida**: Contains "Seashell", which is a natural material but not a precious metal or gem in the same way as gold, silver, or pearl. It's closer to the anti-examples.
6. **Stone Beach, England**: Contains "Stone", a common geological material. This aligns with the anti-examples.
7. **Shell Beach, California**: Contains "Shell", similar to "Seashell", a natural material but not a precious metal or gem. Closer to the anti-examples.
8. **Driftwood Beach, Georgia**: Contains "Driftwood", a natural material. This aligns with the anti-examples.

Now, let's assign scores based on the strength of the match to the specific theme:

- **Strong Matches (Precious Metal/Gem + Beach):** Coral Beach
- **Weaker Matches (Gem/Material + Beach, but with extra words):** Coral Sand Beach
- **Non-Matches (Common Material + Beach):** Pebble Beach, Sandstone Beach, Stone Beach, Driftwood Beach
- **Borderline (Natural Material + Beach):** Seashell Beach, Shell Beach

Let's refine the scoring:

- **1. Coral Sand Beach, Maldives:** "Coral" is a gem, but "Sand" dilutes the match. A score of 6 or 7 seems appropriate.
- **2. Pebble Beach, California:** "Pebble" is a common material. This is a low score, maybe 1 or 2.
- **3. Sandstone Beach, California:** "Sandstone" is a common material. A low score, maybe 1 or 2.
- **4. Coral Beach, Cyprus:** "Coral" is a gem. This is a strong match, 9 or 10.
- **5. Seashell Beach, Florida:** "Seashell" is a natural material, not a precious metal or gem. A lower score, maybe 3 or 4.
- **6. Stone Beach, England:** "Stone" is a common material. A low score, maybe 1 or 2.
- **7. Shell Beach, California:** "Shell" is a natural material, not a precious metal or gem. A lower score, maybe 3 or 4.
- **8. Driftwood Beach, Georgia:** "Driftwood" is a natural material. A low score, maybe 1 or 2.

Final refined scores:

- Coral Sand Beach: 6
- Pebble Beach: 1
- Sandstone Beach: 1
- Coral Beach: 9
- Seashell Beach: 3
- Stone Beach: 1
- Shell Beach: 3
