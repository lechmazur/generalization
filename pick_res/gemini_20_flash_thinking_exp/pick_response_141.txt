The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by the provided examples, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core elements of the theme seem to be:
- **Training/Education:** The examples focus on teaching specific skills.
- **Traditional/Indigenous Practices:**  The examples highlight Polynesian, Ama, and Badjao techniques.
- **Sustainable Harvesting/Ecosystem Maintenance:**  The examples mention oyster collection, sustainable harvesting, and ecosystem maintenance.
- **Specific Geographic/Cultural Context:** The examples are tied to French Polynesia, Japan (Ama), and the Sulu Sea (Badjao).
- **Aquatic Environment:** All examples involve underwater activities.

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:
- **Passive Observation/Documentation:**  Documentary films and museum exhibits are out.
- **Commercial Exploitation:** Commercial pearl farms don't fit.

Now, let's evaluate each candidate against these criteria:

1. **A submerged replica of a historic pearling village used to educate visitors on the cultural significance of pearl diving in the Persian Gulf.**  This has an educational component and a cultural context, but it's more about passive observation than active skill training in traditional methods. It also leans towards the "history" aspect of the anti-examples.

2. **Abalone harvesting cooperative.** This involves harvesting from the sea, which is a connection. However, it lacks the explicit training/educational component and the focus on traditional methods and ecosystem maintenance.

3. **Aquarium with a pearl oyster exhibit.** This is purely observational and falls squarely into the "museum exhibit" category of the anti-examples.

4. **Oyster farming workshop.** This has a training/educational component and involves oysters. However, it lacks the emphasis on traditional diving methods and the specific cultural/geographic context. It's closer to commercial exploitation than traditional practices.

5. **Maritime museum showcasing traditional boats.** This is observational and falls under the "museum exhibit" category of the anti-examples, even though one example mentions boat building. The focus is on the boats, not the diving techniques.

6. **Cultural center celebrating coastal traditions.** This is too broad and lacks the specific focus on underwater skills and harvesting techniques.

7. **Free-diving competition.** While it involves free-diving, it lacks the educational/training aspect and the focus on traditional harvesting and ecosystem maintenance. It's more about athletic performance.

8. **Underwater welding school.** This is underwater, but it has no connection to traditional practices, harvesting, or ecosystem maintenance. It's a modern, industrial skill.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
