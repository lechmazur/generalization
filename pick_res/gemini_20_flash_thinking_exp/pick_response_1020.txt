pick_response_1020.txt
The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples show technologies developed for disaster relief or emergency situations that have found new applications in everyday or non-emergency contexts.

The anti-examples are related to disaster response but don't necessarily have a secondary application or a shift in their primary use.

Based on this, the specific theme is: **Technology initially developed for disaster relief or emergency response that has found a secondary application in a non-emergency or everyday setting.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme.

1. **Radiation detectors:**  Could be used in disaster relief (nuclear accidents), but the prompt doesn't mention a secondary application. Likely a lower score.
2. **Earthquake resistant buildings:** Designed to mitigate disaster impact, not a technology that has found a secondary use. Low score.
3. **Emergency alert systems:**  Specifically for emergencies, no clear secondary application. Low score.
4. **Emergency radio beacons:** Designed for emergencies, no clear secondary application. Low score.
5. **Water filtration systems:** Could be used in disaster relief, and general use is common. This fits the theme. Higher score.
6. **Tsunami warning buoys:**  Specifically for disaster warning, no clear secondary application. Low score.
7. **Seismographs:** Used for monitoring earthquakes, not a technology with a clear secondary application. Low score.
8. **Portable ultrasound devices originally designed for disaster zone triage, now common in routine medical diagnostics:** This is a direct match to the theme. High score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
