The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples are:
- Multnomah Falls Lodge and viewing platform
- Observation Tower at Niagara Falls State Park
- Tunnel View in Yosemite National Park

These all seem to be specific, named locations within a natural setting that offer a designated viewpoint or structure for appreciating a particular scenic vista.

The anti-examples are:
- Yellowstone National Park
- Grand Canyon National Park
- A restaurant with a view

These are broader locations or concepts. Yellowstone and Grand Canyon are entire parks, not specific viewpoints. A restaurant with a view is a general category, not a specific named location.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **named, man-made structures or designated viewpoints within a natural setting, specifically designed for viewing a particular scenic feature.**

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme:

1. **A bridge over a river:** Could be scenic, but not necessarily a *designated viewpoint*. Score: 4
2. **A scenic overlook of a city:**  Focus is on a city, not a natural setting. Score: 2
3. **Golden Gate Bridge:** A named structure, but primarily for transportation, though it offers views. Score: 6
4. **Zion National Park:** An entire park, not a specific viewpoint. Score: 1
5. **A visitor center:**  A building, but not primarily a viewpoint. Score: 3
6. **Hoover Dam:** A named, man-made structure in a natural setting, offering views. Score: 8
7. **Grand View Point Overlook at Canyonlands National Park:** A named, designated viewpoint within a natural setting. Score: 9
8. **Acadia National Park:** An entire park, not a specific viewpoint. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>4</score>
