The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The theme seems to be an object featuring a small, non-functional replica of itself attached to it. The anti-examples highlight that the theme is not simply about nested objects or scale models in general.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme, using a scale of 0 to 10. I need to avoid being misled by the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll evaluate each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1 (Dollhouse):** While it contains miniature objects, it's not a single object with a replica of itself attached. Low score.
*   **Candidate 2 (Figurine):**  Doesn't fit the theme at all. Low score.
*   **Candidate 3 (Lamp with miniature lamp):** This perfectly matches the theme. High score.
*   **Candidate 4 (Model train set):**  Similar to the dollhouse, it's a collection of miniatures, not a single object with a replica. Low score.
*   **Candidate 5 (Miniature landmark):** This is a scale model, but not attached to the original object. Low score.
*   **Candidate 6 (Toy car):**  A miniature, but not attached to a full-sized car. Low score.
*   **Candidate 7 (Scale model airplane):**  A scale model, but not attached to a full-sized airplane. Low score.
*   **Candidate 8 (Ship in a bottle):**  A miniature inside something else, but not a replica attached to the original. Low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
