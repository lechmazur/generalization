The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples suggest a theme of **systems that are somewhat isolated or dependent on external factors for specific inputs or outputs, but maintain a degree of autonomy within their defined boundaries.**

*   **Landlocked country's economy:**  Isolated geographically, dependent on neighbors for trade routes.
*   **Virtual machine:** Isolated software environment, dependent on the host OS for resources.
*   **Off-grid cabin:** Isolated dwelling, dependent on deliveries for certain supplies.

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:

*   **The internet:** A highly interconnected network, not isolated.
*   **A computer network:**  Similar to the internet, focused on connection.
*   **A supply chain:**  The very opposite of isolation, it's about flow and connection.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates based on the specific theme:

*   **Smartphone app:**  Runs within the OS, dependent on the device's hardware and network, but has a degree of autonomy.
*   **Social media platform:** Highly interconnected, relies on the internet, not isolated.
*   **Satellite:** Isolated in space, dependent on ground stations for communication and control.
*   **Ecosystem:**  Interconnected, but with defined boundaries and internal dependencies.
*   **Beehive:**  A self-contained unit with internal organization, but dependent on the external environment.
*   **Colony of ants:** Similar to a beehive, a self-contained unit with internal organization, but dependent on the external environment.
*   **Online multiplayer game:**  Relies on the internet, highly interconnected.
*   **Power grid:**  A network, focused on distribution and connection.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
