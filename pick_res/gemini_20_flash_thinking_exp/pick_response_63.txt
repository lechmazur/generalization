The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Let's analyze the examples:
- vise grip locking pliers:  A tool that clamps and locks onto something.
- door lock deadbolt mechanism: A mechanism that secures a door by extending a bolt.
- toggle clamp fastener: A device that uses a lever action to clamp and hold workpieces.

Common elements:  Mechanical devices, involve clamping or securing, often with a lever or similar mechanism to apply force and lock.

Now let's analyze the anti-examples:
- combination lock: Secures something, but the mechanism is based on rotating tumblers, not a direct clamping or lever action.
- padlock: Secures something, but the mechanism involves a shackle and key, not a direct clamping or lever action.
- ratchet wrench: A tool for tightening or loosening fasteners, but the primary action is rotation, not clamping.

The specific theme seems to be about mechanical devices that use a lever or similar action to clamp or secure something, often with a locking mechanism. The anti-examples highlight that simply securing or fastening is too broad.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. door knob: Primarily for opening and closing, not a clamping or locking mechanism in the same way as the examples. Broader theme: door hardware.
2. garage door opener:  Automated system for opening/closing, not a manual clamping/locking device. Broader theme: automated access.
3. window crank handle:  Used to operate a window mechanism, not directly clamping or locking. Broader theme: window hardware.
4. bicycle brake lever:  Applies force to brake pads, which clamp the wheel rim. This seems like a good fit.
5. belt tensioner pulley: Maintains tension on a belt, but doesn't directly clamp or lock in the same way. Broader theme: mechanical components.
6. engine timing belt:  Connects and synchronizes engine components, not a clamping or locking device. Broader theme: engine components.
7. carabiner clip:  A loop with a spring-loaded gate, used for connecting. It has a locking mechanism in some cases, and the action is similar to clamping.
8. cam lock furniture connector: Uses a cam to lock two pieces of furniture together. This seems like a good fit.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
