The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples all combine:
- A specific type of horse-drawn vehicle (penny-farthing, hansom cab, omnibus) OR a vehicle that *could* be horse-drawn (penny-farthing)
- A method of divination or fortune-telling integrated into the vehicle itself.

The anti-examples are all horse-drawn vehicles or related to fortune-telling, but they lack the specific combination of a vehicle *with* integrated divination.

Therefore, the specific theme is a horse-drawn (or potentially horse-drawn) vehicle that has an integrated method of divination or fortune-telling.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **Stagecoach:** Horse-drawn vehicle, but no inherent divination.
2. **Steam locomotive:** Not horse-drawn, but could have something added.
3. **Hansom cab:** Horse-drawn vehicle, could have divination added.
4. **Crystal ball on display:** Divination, but not a vehicle.
5. **Penny-farthing bicycle:** Could be considered a vehicle, but no inherent divination.
6. **Sedan chair:**  A type of vehicle, but not horse-drawn and no inherent divination.
7. **Steam locomotive with built-in tea leaf reading compartment:** Not horse-drawn, but has integrated divination.
8. **Fortune telling booth:** Divination, but not a vehicle.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
