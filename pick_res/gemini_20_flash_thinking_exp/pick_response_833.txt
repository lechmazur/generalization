The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific architectural theme. I need to identify this specific theme and then evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (Casa da Musica, Heydar Aliyev Center, Kunsthaus Graz) share characteristics of:
- **Modern architecture:**  They are all relatively recent.
- **Non-traditional forms:** They deviate from typical boxy or symmetrical structures.
- **Sculptural quality:** They appear as large, unique objects.
- **Complex geometry:** They feature intricate curves and unconventional shapes.

The anti-examples (Traditional Japanese gardens, Symmetrical skyscrapers, Historical buildings with symmetrical facades) highlight what the specific theme is *not*:
- **Traditional or historical styles.**
- **Symmetry as a primary design principle.**
- **Focus on landscape or internal layout rather than external form.**

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **modern architecture characterized by non-rectilinear, sculptural forms and complex geometry.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Modernist architecture with geometric shapes:** This is close, but "geometric shapes" can be too broad. The examples are more about *complex* and *non-traditional* geometry, not just any geometric shape.
2. **Architectural designs inspired by natural forms:** While some of the examples might have natural inspirations, the defining characteristic is the abstract, sculptural form, not direct mimicry of nature.
3. **The CCTV Headquarters in Beijing, China:** This building is a strong match. It's modern, has a highly unusual, non-rectilinear form, and complex geometry.
4. **Modern architecture with curved, flowing lines:** This aligns very well with the examples.
5. **Urban parks designed with symmetrical pathways:** This is explicitly excluded by the anti-examples.
6. **Urban planning that emphasizes grid patterns:** This is also excluded by the anti-examples, focusing on a different scale and principle.
7. **Landscape architecture focusing on natural flow:** This is related but not the specific architectural theme.
8. **Buildings with symmetrical internal layouts:** This focuses on the interior, which is not the primary characteristic of the examples.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
