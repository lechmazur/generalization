The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples (dbx noise reduction, ADAT, DASH) all seem to be related to *digital or advanced analog audio recording formats or technologies that were prominent in professional or semi-professional settings*.

The anti-examples (digital audio workstation, CD player, MP3) are related to digital audio but are broader categories or end-user formats.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be *professional or advanced analog/digital audio recording formats or technologies*.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

1. **8-track tape:**  A consumer analog format, not really professional.
2. **auto-tune:** An audio effect, not a recording format.
3. **MIDI keyboard:** An input device, not a recording format.
4. **vinyl record:** A playback format, not a recording format.
5. **audio interface:** A device for connecting audio equipment, not a recording format itself.
6. **reel-to-reel tape:** A professional analog recording format.
7. **cassette tape:** A consumer analog format.
8. **Dolby SR:** A professional analog noise reduction technology.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
