The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the core characteristics of the examples and differentiate them from the broader characteristics present in the anti-examples.

Examples:
- Lego building sets: Small, interlocking components used to create larger structures. Focus on creative construction and play.
- 3D printer filament systems:  Material input for a specific additive manufacturing process. Focus on creating objects layer by layer.
- Modular synthesizer components: Electronic modules that generate and manipulate sound. Focus on creating complex audio signals.

Anti-examples:
- Modular shelving systems:  Units that can be combined to create storage solutions. Focus on organization and storage.
- Modular power tool systems:  Tools with interchangeable heads or components for different tasks. Focus on versatility and task completion.
- Modular furniture: Furniture pieces that can be arranged in different configurations. Focus on adaptability and space utilization.

The specific theme seems to revolve around *creating something new or functional* through the combination of *small, specialized, and often technical components*. The anti-examples focus on *organization, versatility, or adaptability* of existing larger units.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme, avoiding the broader themes.

Candidate Evaluation:
1. Modular office partitions:  Focus on dividing space. More aligned with the anti-examples (modular furniture).
2. Interchangeable camera lens systems:  Specialized components that enable different photographic effects. Fits the theme of creating something new (images) through specialized components.
3. Interchangeable watch bands:  Focus on customization and aesthetics. Less about creating something new or functional in a technical sense.
4. Modular kitchen units: Focus on organization and functionality of a space. More aligned with the anti-examples.
5. Modular data center components: Specialized hardware components that work together to create a functional data center. Strong match to the specific theme.
6. Prefabricated home construction kits: Larger units that are assembled. Closer to the anti-examples, although there's an element of creation.
7. Interchangeable bicycle parts: Components that allow for customization and repair. Has elements of the specific theme (specialized components) but also leans towards versatility.
8. Plug-and-play computer peripherals:  Focus on adding functionality to an existing system. Less about creating something entirely new from smaller components.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
