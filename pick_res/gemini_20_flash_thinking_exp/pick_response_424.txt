The user wants to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples: river training wall, jetty, wing dyke. These are all structures built in a body of water, often a river or near a coast, to control water flow, protect the shoreline, or aid navigation. They are typically fixed structures.

Anti-examples: weir, dam, bridge pier. These are also structures in or near water, but they serve different primary purposes. Weirs and dams primarily control water level or flow rate. Bridge piers support a structure above the water.

The specific theme seems to be **structures built in a body of water to direct or control the flow of water or protect the shoreline, often for navigation purposes, and are typically fixed structures**.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, while distinguishing it from the broader theme of "structures in or near water".

1. floating dock: While in water, its primary purpose is for access to boats, not directly controlling water flow or shoreline protection. It's also not a fixed structure. Lower score.
2. groyne:  Built perpendicular to the shoreline to trap sediment and prevent erosion. This fits the theme well. Higher score.
3. culvert: A conduit to carry water under a road or other obstruction. While it manages water flow, it's not primarily for river training or shoreline protection in the same way as the examples. Medium score.
4. water wheel: A device that uses the flow of water to generate power. It interacts with water flow but doesn't fit the structural control aspect of the theme. Lower score.
5. spillway: A structure to release excess water from a dam or reservoir. While it controls water flow, it's more related to the anti-example of a dam. Medium-low score.
6. canal: An artificial waterway. While it involves water, it's the entire waterway itself, not a structure within it for flow control in the same way as the examples. Medium-low score.
7. lock gate: Used to control water levels in a canal or river to allow boats to pass between different levels. It controls water flow for navigation, fitting the theme. Higher score.
8. fish ladder: A structure to help fish migrate past obstacles like dams. While in water, its primary purpose is for fish passage, not direct water flow control or shoreline protection in the same way. Medium-low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
