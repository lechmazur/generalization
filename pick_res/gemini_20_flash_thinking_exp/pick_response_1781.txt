The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are all natural plant fibers used for making rope or twine. The anti-examples are synthetic materials used for similar purposes. The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader theme.

The specific theme seems to be **natural plant fibers used for rope or twine**.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **metal chain**:  Not a fiber, not plant-based. Definitely an anti-example. Score: 0
2. **steel cable**: Made of metal, not a plant fiber. Similar to metal chain. Score: 0
3. **carbon fiber thread**: Synthetic material, not a plant fiber. Score: 1 (Slightly closer to "thread" than chain or cable, but still synthetic)
4. **raffia string**:  Natural plant fiber, used for tying. A good match. Score: 9
5. **paracord**:  Typically nylon, a synthetic material. An anti-example. Score: 1 (It's a type of cord, but not the right material)
6. **glass fiber cord**:  Made of glass, not a plant fiber. Score: 0
7. **kevlar rope**: Synthetic material, high strength. An anti-example. Score: 1
8. **cotton thread**: Natural plant fiber, used for sewing and sometimes thicker cords. A good match, but perhaps not as strong as the initial examples. Score: 8<number>1</number><score>0</score>
