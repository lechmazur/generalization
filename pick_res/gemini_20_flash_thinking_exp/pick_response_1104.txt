The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples are all instances of a helix. The anti-examples are related to spirals but are not strictly helical. The task is to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme of a helix, avoiding broader interpretations of spirals.

Let's analyze each candidate:
1. **The nautilus shell:** This is a spiral, but it's planar, not helical. It's similar to the anti-examples.
2. **A circular staircase:** This can be helical, like the Vatican Museum example.
3. **The pattern of a pinecone:** This exhibits a spiral pattern, related to the Fibonacci sequence, but not a helix. Similar to the sunflower seeds anti-example.
4. **A winding river:** This is a curve, but generally planar and not a consistent helix.
5. **The shape of a hurricane:** This has a spiral structure, similar to a whirlpool, but also has a vertical dimension that can make it somewhat helical.
6. **The shape of a galaxy:**  Galaxies are spiral-shaped, but generally flat, not helical.
7. **The Fibonacci sequence:** This is a mathematical sequence that generates spiral patterns in nature, but it's not a physical helical shape itself.
8. **A coiled rope:** This is a clear example of a helix.

Now, let's assign scores based on how well they fit the *specific* theme of a helix, avoiding the broader theme of spirals:

- **Nautilus shell:**  Strongly spiral, but planar. Low score.
- **Circular staircase:** Can be helical. Good score.
- **Pinecone pattern:** Spiral, but not helical. Low score.
- **Winding river:**  Curved, but not consistently helical. Low score.
- **Hurricane shape:** Has a vertical dimension, making it somewhat helical. Medium score.
- **Galaxy shape:** Spiral, but generally flat. Low score.
- **Fibonacci sequence:**  Mathematical concept related to spirals, not a physical helix. Very low score.
- **Coiled rope:**  Clear example of a helix. High score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
