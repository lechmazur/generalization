The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: Quilliq, Soapstone lamps, Seal oil lamps
Anti-examples: Electric heater, Kerosene lamp, Wood stove

The examples suggest a theme of traditional Inuit/Arctic lighting and heating sources using animal fat/oil. The anti-examples are more modern or general heating/lighting sources.

I need to evaluate each candidate against the specific theme of traditional Inuit/Arctic lighting and heating using animal fat/oil, and not just general heating or lighting.

Candidate evaluation:
1. Propane torch: Uses propane, not animal fat/oil. Modern technology. Low score.
2. Central heating: Modern heating system, not related to the specific theme. Very low score.
3. Campfire: General fire for warmth and cooking, not specifically Inuit or using animal fat/oil for lighting. Lower score.
4. Driftwood fires: General fire using driftwood, not specifically Inuit or using animal fat/oil for lighting. Lower score.
5. Torch: Could be general, but could also be a traditional oil-based torch. Needs consideration.
6. Fireplace: General heating source, not specific to the Inuit or using animal fat/oil for lighting. Lower score.
7. Candle: Uses wax, not animal fat/oil. More general lighting. Lower score.
8. Bonfire: Large open fire, general heating, not specific to the Inuit or using animal fat/oil for lighting. Lower score.

Refining the scores:
1. Propane torch: Clearly not the theme. Score: 0
2. Central heating:  Definitely not the theme. Score: 0
3. Campfire:  Provides warmth, but not the specific type of lighting. Score: 2
4. Driftwood fires: Similar to campfire. Score: 2
5. Torch: Could potentially be an oil-based torch, closer than the others. Score: 5
6. Fireplace:  General heating. Score: 1
7. Candle:  General lighting, but not oil-based. Score: 1
8. Bonfire: General heating. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>0</score>
