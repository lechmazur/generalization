The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score new candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all:
- Objects used in religious/spiritual practices
- Made from natural materials (seeds, bamboo, feather)
- Associated with specific cultural traditions

The anti-examples are:
- Modern interpretation of a spiritual object (dreamcatcher)
- Religious object but not necessarily used in a ritualistic way (Buddha sculpture)
- Religious symbol worn as jewelry (Celtic cross)

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "ritual objects made from natural materials and associated with specific cultural traditions".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes of "religious objects" or "spiritual items".

Candidate breakdown:
1. Brass meditation bowl: Could be used in rituals, but brass is not a natural material in the same way as the examples.
2. Metal incense burner: Similar to the bowl, metal is not a natural material.
3. Porcelain ritual vessel: Porcelain is not a natural material in the same way.
4. Aboriginal Australian message stick made from eucalyptus wood: Fits the criteria - ritual object, natural material (wood), specific cultural tradition.
5. Steel ceremonial sword: Could be ceremonial, but steel is not a natural material.
6. Silver ritual dagger: Could be ritualistic, but silver is not a natural material.
7. Bronze ritual bell: Could be ritualistic, but bronze is not a natural material.
8. Painted wooden idol: Fits the criteria - ritual object, natural material (wood), could be associated with a specific cultural tradition.

Scoring strategy:
- 8-10: Strong match - ritual object, natural material, clear cultural association.
- 5-7: Moderate match - ritual object, but material is less natural or cultural association is less clear.
- 2-4: Weak match - might be used in rituals, but material is clearly not natural.
- 0-1: No match.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
