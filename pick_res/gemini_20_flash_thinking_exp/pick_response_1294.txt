The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme from the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they match *that specific theme*, not a broader or related theme.

The examples are all physical, pre-modern methods of recording information:
- Wax tablets (ancient Rome)
- Knotted strings (Inca)
- Birch bark scrolls (Ojibwe)

The anti-examples are modern, digital methods of sharing or preserving information:
- Social media platform
- Digital music platform
- Modern library with digital archives

The specific theme seems to be **pre-modern, physical methods of recording information/knowledge/culture**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A blog about contemporary cultural practices**:  Digital, modern. Low score.
2. **A streaming service offering educational content**: Digital, modern. Low score.
3. **A video game that teaches about present-day culture**: Digital, modern. Low score.
4. **A smartphone used for storing family photos**: Digital, modern. Low score.
5. **A website dedicated to modern folklore**: Digital, modern. Low score.
6. **A modern digital encyclopedia**: Digital, modern. Low score.
7. **The clay tablets of the ancient Sumerians used for cuneiform writing**: Physical, pre-modern. High score.
8. **A contemporary history textbook**: Physical, modern. Medium score - it's physical but not pre-modern in its creation.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
