The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are "well nut", "blind rivet", and "rivet nut". The anti-examples are "bolt", "grommet", and "clamp".

The examples suggest the theme is "fasteners that create a threaded hole in thin or pre-drilled materials, often used when access is limited to one side". The anti-examples are broader fasteners or joining elements.

I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **zip tie:**  While a fastener, it doesn't create a threaded hole. It's more about bundling. Low score.
*   **toggle bolt:** Creates a secure fixing in hollow walls, using a threaded bolt and wings. It shares the aspect of limited access but uses a bolt, which is an anti-example. Moderate score.
*   **key ring:**  Connects keys, not really a structural fastener in the same sense. Low score.
*   **snap fastener:**  Joins fabric or thin materials, doesn't create a threaded hole. Moderate-low score.
*   **carabiner:**  A connecting link, often with a spring-loaded gate. Not primarily for creating threaded connections. Low score.
*   **latch:**  Secures a door or lid, but doesn't create a threaded hole. Moderate-low score.
*   **hook:**  A hanging device, not a fastener that creates a threaded hole. Low score.
*   **nut:**  While a component of a bolted connection (an anti-example), a rivet nut *is* an example. A nut on its own requires a bolt. This is tricky. It's related but not the specific theme. Moderate score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
