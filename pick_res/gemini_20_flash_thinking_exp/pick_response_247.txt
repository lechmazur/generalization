The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (James Turrell's Skyspace, Noguchi's California Scenario, Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial) share the following characteristics:
- They are site-specific artworks.
- They are designed to evoke contemplation and reflection.
- They often engage with the surrounding environment.
- They are often public or semi-public spaces.
- They have a strong artistic or memorial intent.

The anti-examples (traditional Japanese rock garden, meditation labyrinth, sacred grove) share some broader characteristics with the examples (e.g., promoting contemplation, connection with nature) but lack the specific artistic or memorial intent and the sense of being a deliberately designed artwork in the same way as the examples.

Based on this, the specific theme seems to be **site-specific, contemporary artworks designed for contemplation and reflection, often with a memorial or artistic purpose, and engaging with the surrounding environment.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Andy Goldsworthy's Stone River at Stanford:** Goldsworthy's work is site-specific and uses natural materials. It evokes contemplation and is an artwork. It fits the specific theme well.
2. **A monastery courtyard:** While potentially contemplative, it lacks the strong artistic intent of the examples and is more functional. It leans towards the broader theme.
3. **The Taj Mahal gardens:**  While beautiful and designed, it's more of a traditional garden with architectural integration than a contemporary artwork in the same vein as the examples. It leans towards the broader theme.
4. **A botanical garden:** Primarily for scientific and recreational purposes, lacking the strong artistic or memorial intent. It fits a broader theme of designed outdoor spaces.
5. **A forest clearing:** Natural and not intentionally designed as an artwork. It fits a broader theme of natural contemplative spaces.
6. **A mountain lookout point:**  A natural feature, not an artwork. It fits a broader theme of scenic and contemplative locations.
7. **A Buddhist temple:** Primarily a religious structure, not necessarily an artwork in the same sense as the examples. It leans towards the broader theme of sacred spaces.
8. **A zen garden rake:** An object used in a zen garden, not the entire environment or artwork itself. It's a tool related to one of the anti-examples.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
