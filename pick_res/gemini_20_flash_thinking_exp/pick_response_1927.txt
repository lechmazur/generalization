The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all wearable devices that integrate multiple health monitoring functions into a single, self-contained unit.

The anti-examples are devices that perform a single health monitoring function or require a separate receiver.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely: **Wearable devices that integrate multiple health monitoring functions into a single, self-contained unit.**

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

Candidate 1: Smart contact lens that monitors intraocular pressure. This is wearable but only monitors one metric. Likely a low score.
Candidate 2: A fitness tracker that only counts steps and calories burned. This is wearable but only monitors basic activity metrics, not health metrics in the same way as the examples. Likely a low score.
Candidate 3: A smartwatch that tracks heart rate, sleep patterns, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature. This is wearable and integrates multiple health monitoring functions. Likely a high score.
Candidate 4: A blood pressure cuff. This is not continuously worn and is a single-function device. Likely a low score.
Candidate 5: A heart rate monitor chest strap. This is wearable but primarily a single-function device, although it might be used in conjunction with another device. Likely a low score.
Candidate 6: A sleep tracker mat placed under the mattress. This is not worn on the body. Likely a very low score.
Candidate 7: A thermometer. This is a single-function device and not continuously worn. Likely a very low score.
Candidate 8: A smart clothing item that monitors posture. This is wearable but focuses on a single metric (posture). Likely a low score.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
