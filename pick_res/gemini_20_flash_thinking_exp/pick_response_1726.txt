The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

Examples:
- The Berlin Wall: A physical structure with historical and political significance, representing division and later reunification.
- The Declaration of Independence: A foundational document declaring independence.
- The Rosetta Stone: A historical artifact with significant linguistic importance, unlocking the understanding of hieroglyphs.

Anti-examples:
- a historic treaty: A written agreement between parties.
- a famous speech: A spoken address.
- a national flag: A symbolic representation of a nation.

The specific theme seems to be **significant historical artifacts or documents that mark a turning point or provide crucial insight into a historical period or event.**  They are tangible items with lasting impact.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. a historic map: Could be significant, but less of a turning point or foundational document than the examples.
2. The Gutenberg Bible: A highly significant historical artifact and document, marking a turning point in printing.
3. a historic ship:  Could be significant, but less about information or foundational principles.
4. a historic monument: Similar to the Berlin Wall, a physical structure with historical significance.
5. a famous photograph: Captures a moment, but less about foundational principles or unlocking understanding of a period.
6. a famous diary: Personal account, less about broad historical shifts or foundational documents.
7. a historic building: Could be significant, but less about information or foundational principles.
8. a classic novel: A work of fiction, not a historical artifact or document in the same way.<number>1</number><score>5</score>
