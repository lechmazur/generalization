The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples clearly point to safety measures implemented *after* a specific disaster or series of accidents to prevent similar events in the future. The anti-examples are general safety measures that are not necessarily tied to a specific past disaster.

The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader interpretation of safety measures.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Earthquake-resistant buildings:** While related to safety, these are often implemented based on general risk assessment and building codes, not necessarily a specific earthquake disaster. It's preventative but not directly tied to a specific past event in the same way as the examples.
2. **Emergency oxygen masks:** These are standard safety equipment, not necessarily implemented after a specific incident, although their importance might have been highlighted by past aviation accidents.
3. **Emergency exits:** Similar to oxygen masks, these are standard safety features, not necessarily a direct response to a specific disaster.
4. **Airbags:**  While their development was driven by the need to reduce injuries in car accidents, they weren't implemented *after* a single, defining disaster in the same way as the examples.
5. **Life jackets on airplanes:** Standard safety equipment, not necessarily implemented after a specific airplane disaster, although their importance is clear from past events.
6. **Watertight bulkheads added to ships after the Titanic sinking:** This is a direct parallel to the examples. It's a specific design change implemented as a direct result of a major disaster.
7. **Tsunami warning buoys:** These are implemented as a direct response to past tsunami disasters to provide early warning and prevent future casualties.
8. **Seat belts:**  While crucial for safety, seat belts were a gradual development and implementation, not a direct response to a single, defining disaster in the same way as the examples.
