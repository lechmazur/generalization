The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "spring-loaded clothespin", "handcuffs", and "carabiner". The anti-examples are "pliers", "nutcracker", and "binder clip". The task is to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core characteristic of the examples seems to be a mechanism that uses a spring or similar force to maintain a closed state, which can be opened by applying force and then automatically returns to the closed state.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **lobster claw clasp**:  Uses a spring mechanism to keep it closed. Seems like a good match.
2. **window latch**: Some window latches use a spring to hold them in position. Could be a match, but less definitive than the examples.
3. **paper clip**: Does not use a spring mechanism. It relies on the elasticity of the metal. Definitely not a match.
4. **folding ladder**:  Does not inherently use a spring mechanism for its primary function. Might have spring-loaded locking mechanisms, but that's not its defining feature.
5. **scissors**:  Does not use a spring to maintain a closed state. The blades are held together by a pivot.
6. **tweezers**: Some tweezers are spring-loaded to stay open, requiring force to close. This is the opposite of the examples. However, some have a spring to keep them closed.
7. **safety pin**: Uses a spring mechanism to keep the pin closed and the clasp secured. Good match.
8. **folding chair**: Does not inherently use a spring mechanism for its primary function. Might have spring-loaded locking mechanisms, but that's not its defining feature.

Now, let's assign scores, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.

* **Lobster claw clasp**: Strong spring mechanism, similar function to carabiner. Score: 9
* **Window latch**: Some use springs, but not all. Less direct application of the theme than the examples. Score: 6
* **Paper clip**: No spring mechanism. Score: 1
* **Folding ladder**:  Not primarily spring-loaded. Score: 2
* **Scissors**: No spring mechanism for closing. Score: 1
* **Tweezers**: Some are spring-loaded to close, some to open. The examples are all spring-loaded to close. Score: 5
* **Safety pin**: Clear spring mechanism for closure. Score: 8
* **Folding chair**: Not primarily spring-loaded. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>9</score>
