The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they match that specific theme.

The examples are all Turkish oil wrestling festivals.
The anti-examples are other Turkish events, some sporting, some cultural, but none are oil wrestling.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "Turkish oil wrestling festivals".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding being misled by broader themes like "Turkish festivals" or "Turkish sporting events".

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

1. **Hidrellez celebrations:** This is a spring festival celebrated in Turkey and other Balkan countries. It's a cultural event, but not specifically oil wrestling. Likely a low score.
2. **Alanya International Triathlon:** This is a sporting event, but it's a triathlon, not wrestling. Likely a very low score.
3. **Tarihi Elmalı Yağlı Güreşleri:** This translates to "Historical Elmalı Oil Wrestling". This is a direct match to the specific theme. Likely a high score.
4. **Mesir Macunu Festival:** This is a traditional Turkish festival celebrating a special sweet paste. It's a cultural event, not related to wrestling. Likely a low score.
5. **Edirne Kakava Festival:** This is another name for the Hidrellez festival, particularly in Edirne. Similar to candidate 1, it's a cultural event, not oil wrestling. Likely a low score.
6. **Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day:** This is a national holiday in Turkey, focusing on remembrance and sports. While it involves sports, it's not specifically oil wrestling. Likely a low score.
7. **Konya Mevlana Festival:** This is a religious and cultural festival commemorating the Sufi mystic Rumi. It has no connection to wrestling. Likely a very low score.
8. **Turkish Grand Prix (Formula 1):** This is a major international motorsport event held in Turkey. It's a sporting event, but not wrestling. Likely a very low score.

Now I will assign scores, ensuring they are granular and use the full range.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
