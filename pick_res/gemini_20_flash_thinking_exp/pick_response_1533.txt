The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples point towards sacred groves or sites with strong connections to indigenous cultures and nature. The anti-examples are major religious centers of Abrahamic faiths, which are clearly distinct from the nature-based, indigenous focus of the examples.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "Sacred Groves/Sites of Indigenous Cultures".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for each candidate:

*   **Mount Olympus, Greece:** While sacred in ancient Greek religion, it's more of a mythological dwelling of gods than a sacred grove in the same vein as the examples. It has some overlap but isn't a perfect fit. Score: 6
*   **Machu Picchu, Peru:**  A significant Inca site with strong spiritual and cultural connections to nature. Fits the theme well. Score: 8
*   **Notre-Dame Cathedral, France:** A major Christian cathedral. Clearly an anti-example based on the provided anti-examples. Score: 1
*   **Chichen Itza, Mexico:** A significant Mayan site with religious and astronomical importance, deeply connected to their culture and environment. Fits the theme well. Score: 9
*   **Angkor Wat, Cambodia:** Primarily a Hindu (later Buddhist) temple complex. While culturally significant, it leans more towards organized religion than the nature-based focus of the examples. Score: 5
*   **Hawaiian Sacred Groves, Hawaii:** Directly matches the theme, similar to the Mijikenda Kayas. Score: 10
*   **Mount Fuji, Japan:**  A sacred mountain in Shinto and Japanese culture, with strong natural and spiritual significance. Fits the theme well. Score: 8
*   **Uluru, Australia:**  A sacred site for Aboriginal Australians, deeply connected to their Dreamtime stories and the land. Fits the theme very well. Score: 9<number>1</number><score>6</score>
