pick_response_807.txt
The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are "semaphore flag", "hot air balloon", and "carrier pigeon". These all represent methods of communication that are:
1. **Visual or physical:**  They rely on sight or physical movement.
2. **One-way (primarily):**  While a response is possible, the primary function is sending a message.
3. **Pre-electronic/mechanical:** They don't rely on complex electrical or mechanical systems in the way modern devices do.
4. **Relatively short-range (compared to modern tech):**  Their effective range is limited by visibility or the pigeon's flight.

The anti-examples are "smartphone", "telephone", and "radio". These are all electronic devices for communication that are:
1. **Electronic:** They rely on electrical signals.
2. **Two-way:** They facilitate back-and-forth communication.
3. **Long-range:** They can transmit information over significant distances.

Therefore, the specific theme is **non-electronic, primarily one-way, visual/physical communication methods**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of "communication".

1. **a drone:**  Can be used for visual communication (carrying a message, taking pictures), but it's electronic and can be two-way. Lower score.
2. **a television:**  Electronic, one-way communication, but not physical in the same way as the examples. Low score.
3. **a fax machine:** Electronic, two-way communication. Low score.
4. **a quill and inkwell:**  Used for written communication, which is physical and one-way. Fits the theme well. High score.
5. **a computer:** Electronic, two-way communication. Low score.
6. **a satellite:** Electronic, can be used for one-way or two-way communication over long distances. Low score.
7. **a pager:** Electronic, primarily one-way communication. Closer than some, but still electronic. Mid-range score.
8. **a walkie-talkie:** Electronic, two-way communication. Low score.

Now I will assign scores from 0 to 10, ensuring granularity and using the full range.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
