The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples (fractal tree, snowflake, cellular automaton pattern) share the characteristic of being generated by simple, repetitive rules applied iteratively, resulting in complex and often self-similar structures.

The anti-examples (crystal lattice, honeycomb, neural network) also exhibit patterns and structure, but their formation mechanisms are different. Crystal lattices are formed by repeating unit cells, honeycombs by efficient packing, and neural networks by learning and connection weights. These are more about regular repetition or emergent behavior from interconnected units, rather than iterative application of a single rule.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be about structures generated by iterative application of simple rules, leading to self-similarity or complex patterns from simple origins.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

1. **a coastline:** Coastlines are formed by erosion and geological processes, which are complex but not necessarily iterative applications of a single rule. Might have some fractal properties, but not purely generated by a simple iterative rule.
2. **a spider web:**  Built by a spider following a set of behavioral rules, but not necessarily iterative in the same way as the examples. Has some radial symmetry.
3. **a flock of birds:** Emergent behavior from individual bird rules, but not a single iterative rule applied to a structure.
4. **a river delta:** Formed by sediment deposition, a complex process influenced by many factors, not a simple iterative rule. Might have some branching patterns.
5. **a bacterial colony:** Growth through cell division, which is a repetitive process. Can form complex patterns.
6. **a coral reef:** Growth through the accumulation of coral polyps, a biological process. Has complex branching structures.
7. **a weather system:**  Driven by complex atmospheric dynamics, not a simple iterative rule.
8. **a termite mound:** Built by termites following behavioral rules, but not a single iterative rule applied to a structure.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>5</score>
<number>3</number><score>2</score>
<number>4</number><score>7</score>
<number>5</number><score>8</score>
<number>6</number><score>6</score>
<number>7</number><score>3</score>
<number>8</number><score>4</score>
