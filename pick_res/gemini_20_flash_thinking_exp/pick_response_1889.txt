The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Lisbon earthquake and tsunami (natural disaster leading to devastation)
- Île de Ré (departure point for exiled religious group due to political/religious persecution)
- Fort William Henry (site of a massacre after surrender in a war)

Anti-examples:
- Auschwitz (site of genocide)
- The Killing Fields (site of genocide)
- Boston Massacre (site of a violent clash with political implications)

The specific theme seems to be a location significant due to a specific, impactful event that resulted in significant loss of life or displacement, but *not* systematic extermination or genocide. The events in the examples have a more specific historical context and are not solely defined by mass killing.

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme.

1. The Alamo: A battle resulting in significant loss of life. Seems to fit.
2. Hiroshima: Site of an atomic bombing, massive loss of life. Might be too broad, similar to the anti-examples in terms of scale of death.
3. The Bastille:  Storming of a prison, a pivotal event in the French Revolution. Fits the theme of a significant historical event.
4. Gettysburg: A major battle in the American Civil War with heavy casualties. Fits the theme.
5. The Wexford Bridge: Site of a massacre during a rebellion. Strong fit.
6. Ground Zero: Site of a terrorist attack with massive loss of life. Similar to Hiroshima, might be too broad.
7. Ford's Theatre: Site of Lincoln's assassination. A significant historical event with a specific victim. Might be a slightly weaker fit than the others.
8. Little Bighorn Battlefield: Site of a significant battle with heavy casualties. Fits the theme.

Now I will assign scores based on how well each candidate fits the *specific* theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
<number>2</number><score>4</score>
<number>3</number><score>7</score>
<number>4</number><score>8</score>
