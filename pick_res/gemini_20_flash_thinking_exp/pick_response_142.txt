The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit a specific theme, as exemplified by the provided examples and contrasted with the anti-examples. The core of the theme seems to be about temporary or purpose-built settlements that evolve into permanent communities. The anti-examples highlight things that are either inherently temporary, mobile, or lack the initial purpose-driven establishment.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

*   **Candidate 1: A ghost town abandoned after a gold rush:** This started as a temporary settlement driven by a specific purpose (gold rush) but *failed* to become permanent. This is the opposite of the theme.
*   **Candidate 2: A research station in Antarctica:**  Purpose-built, but generally intended to be temporary or with rotating staff, not evolving into a permanent community in the traditional sense.
*   **Candidate 3: Labor camps for large construction projects, like dams or railroads, that later became established settlements:** This directly matches the theme. Temporary, purpose-built, evolving into permanent.
*   **Candidate 4: A seasonal ski resort:**  Purpose-built, but inherently seasonal and not intended for permanent year-round living by a stable community.
*   **Candidate 5: A tent used for camping:**  Intrinsically temporary and not intended for permanent settlement.
*   **Candidate 6: A cruise ship:** Mobile and not a land-based settlement.
*   **Candidate 7: An oil rig:** Purpose-built, but generally temporary and not intended to become a permanent community on land.
*   **Candidate 8: A nomadic yurt:**  Inherently mobile and not a fixed settlement.

Now, let's assign scores using the full range (0-10):

*   Candidate 1:  Very low score, as it's the opposite of the theme.
*   Candidate 2:  Low to mid-range, as it's purpose-built but not intended for permanent community growth.
*   Candidate 3:  High score, as it perfectly matches the theme.
*   Candidate 4:  Low score, due to its seasonal nature.
*   Candidate 5:  Very low score, as it's inherently temporary.
*   Candidate 6:  Very low score, as it's mobile.
*   Candidate 7:  Low score, as it's generally temporary.
*   Candidate 8:  Very low score, as it's nomadic.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
