The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are Garry Kasparov, Boris Gelfand, and Viswanathan Anand. These are all world chess champions.

The anti-examples are a chess strategy book, a chess coach, and a chess commentator. These are related to chess but are not world chess champions.

Therefore, the specific theme is "former world chess champions".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether they are former world chess champions.

1. a chess puzzle: Not a person, not a world champion. Score: 0
2. a chess streamer: Not necessarily a world champion. Score: 1
3. a chess tournament: Not a person, not a world champion. Score: 0
4. Vladimir Kramnik: A former world chess champion. Score: 10
5. a chess endgame: Not a person, not a world champion. Score: 0
6. a chess middlegame: Not a person, not a world champion. Score: 0
7. a chess club: Not a person, not a world champion. Score: 0
8. a chess opening: Not a person, not a world champion. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>0</score>
