The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples all involve mechanical power transmission using a continuous loop or band. The anti-examples involve fluid power or bulk material transport.

Let's analyze each candidate:
1. **Electric motor:**  Provides power but doesn't inherently transmit it via a loop. Closer to the *source* of power than the *transmission* method.
2. **Pulley system with multiple ropes:** Uses ropes for power transmission, but not necessarily a single continuous loop like a chain or belt.
3. **Water wheel:**  A source of power, not a transmission mechanism in the same way as the examples.
4. **Wind turbine:**  A source of power, not a transmission mechanism in the same way as the examples.
5. **Gearbox:**  Transmits power, but through meshing gears, not a continuous loop.
6. **Steam engine:** A source of power, not a transmission mechanism in the same way as the examples.
7. **Internal combustion engine:** A source of power, not a transmission mechanism in the same way as the examples.
8. **Band saw:** Uses a continuous band for cutting, which is a form of mechanical power transmission to the blade.
