The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (Neutrinos, Exoplanets, Gravitational waves) all relate to recent discoveries in astrophysics and fundamental physics, particularly those that require advanced detection methods and are often at the forefront of current research. They are not directly observable with the naked eye and represent phenomena that reveal fundamental aspects of the universe.

The anti-examples (DNA structure, Bacteria, Solar wind) are related to science but fall into different categories. DNA structure is in biology/biochemistry, Bacteria is in biology/microbiology, and Solar wind, while related to space, is a more classical and directly observable phenomenon compared to the examples.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **recent discoveries in fundamental physics and astrophysics that require advanced detection methods**.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **Nuclear fission**: While related to physics, it's a well-established process, not a recent discovery in the same vein as the examples. It's also more applied than fundamental.
2. **Blood cells**: Clearly in biology, not physics or astrophysics.
3. **X-rays**: Discovered much earlier and a well-understood part of the electromagnetic spectrum. While used in astrophysics, they are not a recent fundamental discovery themselves.
4. **Radio waves**: Similar to X-rays, discovered earlier and well-understood. Used in astrophysics but not the same category as the examples.
5. **Atoms**: A fundamental concept in physics, but not a recent discovery.
6. **Continental drift**: A geological process, not related to fundamental physics or astrophysics in the same way.
7. **Cell division**: A biological process.
8. **Higgs boson**: A recent discovery in fundamental particle physics, requiring advanced detection methods.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>0</score>
<number>3</number><score>4</score>
<number>4</number><score>4</score>
<number>5</number><score>5</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>0</score>
<number>8</number><score>9</score>
