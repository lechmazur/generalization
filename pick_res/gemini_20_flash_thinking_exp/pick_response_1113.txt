The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the core elements of the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

The examples emphasize:
- Simplicity and minimalism in ritual elements.
- Use of natural or basic elements (recycled metal, silence, salt, natural light, water, single candle).
- A sense of quiet contemplation or introspection.

The anti-examples emphasize:
- Elaborate and complex rituals.
- Use of many participants and sensory inputs (choir, incense, elaborate decorations, large gatherings).
- A sense of public celebration and spectacle.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **minimalist rituals using basic, natural elements, often performed in silence or with minimal sensory input.**

Now I will evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A bar mitzvah celebration:**  While it can have spiritual elements, it often involves a public reading, speeches, and a celebratory meal. It's not inherently minimalist.
2. **A Chinese New Year parade:** This is a large, public, and elaborate celebration with many sensory inputs.
3. **An Olympic opening ceremony:** This is a massive spectacle with elaborate performances and many participants.
4. **A military funeral:** While somber, it often involves formal procedures, speeches, and a large gathering.
5. **A traditional African naming ceremony:**  These can vary, but often involve community participation, music, and feasting.
6. **A baptism ceremony:**  While it uses water, it often involves a religious leader, pronouncements, and potentially a congregation.
7. **A tea ceremony performed in an empty white room with just one ceramic cup:** This strongly aligns with the minimalist and basic elements of the specific theme.
8. **A Zen garden dedication:** This likely involves quiet contemplation and natural elements, fitting the theme.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
