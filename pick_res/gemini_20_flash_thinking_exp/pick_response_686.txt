The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the core characteristics of the examples and the reasons why the anti-examples don't fit.

Examples:
- Neural networks: Process information, within AI.
- Blockchain: Secure, distributed data transactions.
- HTML: Used in web pages, defines structure and content.

Common thread: Digital information processing, structuring, or transmission for a specific purpose. They all involve digital data and a defined structure or protocol.

Anti-examples:
- Linear TV broadcast: Analog or digital signal, but primarily for real-time content delivery, not necessarily structured data processing.
- Radio signal transmission: Similar to TV, focuses on broadcasting audio.
- Live sports event broadcast:  The content is the event, the transmission is the delivery mechanism.

Common thread in anti-examples: Focus on real-time broadcasting of content, not necessarily structured data processing or transactions.

The specific theme seems to be about technologies that deal with structured digital information, often with a focus on processing, structuring, or secure transactions.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of general communication or information delivery.

Candidate evaluation:
1. Podcast episode: Digital audio content, but less about structured data processing than the examples. More akin to the anti-examples in terms of content delivery.
2. Traditional printed book: Physical medium, not digital. Doesn't fit the digital aspect of the theme.
3. Morse code transmission:  A way to encode information digitally, but very basic and not focused on complex processing or transactions.
4. Video conference call: Real-time communication, similar to the anti-examples, although it involves digital data.
5. Streaming music service: Delivery of digital audio content, similar to podcasts and the anti-examples.
6. Graph databases:  Specifically designed for managing and querying connected data. This strongly aligns with the theme of structured digital information processing.
7. Fax machine transmission:  Transmission of documents, but uses analog signals and is not focused on complex data processing or transactions in the same way as the examples.
8. Satellite communication system:  A method of transmitting signals, can be used for various purposes, including those related to the theme, but is primarily a delivery mechanism.

Scoring strategy:
- 10: Direct match to the core aspects of the theme.
- 7-9: Strong match with some minor differences.
- 4-6: Moderate match, shares some characteristics but also has significant differences.
- 1-3: Weak match, only tangentially related.
- 0: No match at all.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
