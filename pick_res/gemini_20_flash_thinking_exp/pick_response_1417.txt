The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme defined by the examples, and explicitly *not* the broader theme suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples all involve a physical float that moves with the liquid level. The anti-examples use non-contact methods.

Therefore, the specific theme is "liquid level sensing using a physical float".

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10 based on how well it fits this specific theme.

- Candidates that explicitly mention a float should get high scores.
- Candidates that use other technologies similar to the anti-examples should get low scores.
- Candidates with ambiguous names need to be evaluated based on whether they *could* involve a float mechanism.

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for each candidate:

1. **Acoustic level sensor:** This sounds like it uses sound waves, similar to the anti-examples. Low score.
2. **Microwave level measurement system:**  This also sounds like a non-contact method, similar to the anti-examples. Low score.
3. **Electromagnetic level gauge:** This is ambiguous. It *could* involve a float with a magnet, but it's not explicit. Moderate score.
4. **Magnetostrictive level transmitter:**  While it can be used with floats, the name itself doesn't imply a float. It's more about the sensing technology. Moderate score, leaning slightly higher because it's often used with floats.
5. **Capacitive level sensor:** This measures capacitance changes, not a float. Low score.
6. **Mechanical float switch in a sump pump system:** This explicitly mentions a "mechanical float". High score.
7. **Fiber optic level sensor:** This uses light, not a float. Low score.
8. **Optical liquid level sensor:** This uses light, not a float. Low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
