The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader one.

The examples (car chassis, walnut, knight's suit of armor) all suggest a protective outer layer or structure that encloses and protects something valuable or vulnerable.

The anti-examples (phone case, bank vault, safe) also offer protection, but they are distinct. A phone case is for a specific device, a bank vault is for large-scale storage, and a safe is a secure container. The key difference seems to be the *nature* of the protection and what is being protected. The examples are more about a structural, often form-fitting, protective layer, while the anti-examples are more about containers or external devices for security.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **A holster:**  Holds and protects a handgun. Seems like a good fit for the specific theme.
2. **A bomb shelter:** Offers protection, but it's a large structure, not a form-fitting layer. More aligned with the anti-examples.
3. **A shield (as carried by a soldier):**  Provides direct protection, but it's actively wielded, not a passive enclosure. Closer to the theme than the anti-examples, but not a perfect fit.
4. **A scabbard:**  Protects a sword. Very similar to a holster, a good fit.
5. **Bubble wrap:** Provides cushioning and protection during transport. Less structural and more about impact absorption. A weaker fit.
6. **A padded envelope:** Similar to bubble wrap, offers protection during transit. Not a structural enclosure.
7. **A geode:**  A rock with a hollow cavity containing crystals. The outer shell protects the crystals inside. A strong fit.
8. **An umbrella:** Protects from rain. Not a structural enclosure and the protection is against the elements, not physical damage. A poor fit.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
