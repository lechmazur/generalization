The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples suggest a combination of traditional craftsmanship with modern digital techniques. The anti-examples highlight purely digital or purely industrial/mass-produced items.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Objects that combine traditional handcrafted elements with modern digital fabrication or integration.**

Now I need to score each candidate based on this theme.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
