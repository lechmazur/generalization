The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Calm fury", "Silent storm", and "Peaceful chaos". These all involve an oxymoron where a typically intense or disruptive concept is paired with a calming or quiet one. The anti-examples, "Turbulent peace", "Quiet riot", and "Relaxing tension", reverse this structure, pairing an intense adjective with a typically calm noun.

The task is to score the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme of a calm adjective paired with an intense noun.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Silent argument**: "Silent" is calm, "argument" is intense. This fits the theme well.
2. **Soft thunder**: "Soft" is calm, "thunder" is intense. This fits the theme well.
3. **Tranquil unrest**: "Tranquil" is calm, "unrest" is intense. This fits the theme well.
4. **Harsh whisper**: "Harsh" is intense, "whisper" is calm. This is the reverse of the theme.
5. **Loud silence**: "Loud" is intense, "silence" is calm. This is the reverse of the theme.
6. **Quiet explosion**: "Quiet" is calm, "explosion" is intense. This fits the theme well.
7. **Gentle roar**: "Gentle" is calm, "roar" is intense. This fits the theme well.
8. **Soothing scream**: "Soothing" is calm, "scream" is intense. This fits the theme well.

Now, let's assign scores, considering the nuances:

- Candidates that perfectly match the structure should get higher scores.
- Candidates that reverse the structure should get lower scores.
- There might be slight variations in how well the words fit the intensity/calmness aspect.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>7</score>
<number>4</number><score>2</score>

<number>6</number><score>10</score>
