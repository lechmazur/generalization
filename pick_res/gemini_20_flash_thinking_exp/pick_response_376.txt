The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are 'clay pot', 'bamboo sieve', and 'calabash gourd spoon'. These items seem to be natural, possibly traditional kitchen tools made from plant-based or earthen materials. The anti-examples are 'plastic serving spoon', 'rubber spatula', and 'plastic strainer'. These are modern kitchen tools made from synthetic materials.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader theme. I need to consider the material and likely traditional use of the candidates.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **Cast iron skillet:**  While not plant-based, it's a traditional material. It's heavier and more durable than the examples, but still fits the general idea of older cooking tools. Likely a mid-range score.
*   **Wooden mortar:**  Fits the theme very well. Natural material, traditional use. High score.
*   **Nylon cooking utensils:**  Clearly an anti-example based on the provided anti-examples. Low score.
*   **Ceramic bowl:**  Similar to the clay pot, made from earthen material. Good fit. High score.
*   **Stone grinding wheel:** Natural material, traditional tool. Good fit. High score.
*   **Porcelain plate:**  Similar to ceramic, but perhaps more refined and less rustic than the examples. Still a good fit, but maybe slightly lower than ceramic.
*   **Silicone baking mat:**  Modern, synthetic material. Clearly an anti-example. Low score.
*   **Bamboo steamer basket:**  Matches the 'bamboo sieve' example perfectly. High score.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
