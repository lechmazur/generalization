The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples are the fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity). The anti-examples are related to physics but are not fundamental forces. The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they match the specific theme (fundamental forces) and not the broader theme of physics concepts.

Here's a breakdown of how to score each candidate:

*   **Gravity:** This is a fundamental force, just like the examples. So it should get a high score.
*   **Air resistance, Surface tension, Friction, Viscosity:** These are all macroscopic forces arising from electromagnetic interactions at the atomic level. They are related but not fundamental forces themselves.
*   **Radiation:** This is a way energy can be transmitted, often through electromagnetic waves, but it's not a force itself.
*   **Elasticity:** This is a property of materials related to their ability to deform and return to their original shape. It arises from intermolecular forces, which are ultimately electromagnetic.
*   **Buoyancy:** This is an upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object. It arises from pressure differences in the fluid, which are ultimately due to gravity and intermolecular forces.
*   **Centripetal force:** This is a force that makes a body follow a curved path. It's not a fundamental force itself but rather a description of the net force acting on an object. The actual force could be gravity, tension, friction, etc.
*   **Momentum:** This is a property of a moving object, defined as mass times velocity. It's a concept in physics but not a fundamental force.
*   **Inertia:** This is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. It's a fundamental property of mass but not a force itself.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores to each candidate, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>2</score>
<number>3</number><score>9</score>
<number>4</number><score>1</score>
<number>5</number><score>3</score>
<number>6</number><score>2</score>
<number>7</number><score>0</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
