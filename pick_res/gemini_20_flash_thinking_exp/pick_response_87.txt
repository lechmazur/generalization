The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific architectural theme. I need to identify this theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit *only* the specific theme, not broader related themes.

The examples are:
- Kiva at Mesa Verde: Underground ceremonial structure.
- Hypogeum of Ä¦al Saflieni: Underground prehistoric burial site.
- Underground church of St. George:  Church carved into rock below ground level.

The anti-examples are:
- Sistine Chapel:  Ornate, above-ground chapel.
- Hagia Sophia: Large, above-ground basilica/mosque/museum.
- Notre-Dame Cathedral:  Large, above-ground Gothic cathedral.

The specific theme seems to be **subterranean or partially subterranean religious/ceremonial structures**. The anti-examples are all prominent, above-ground religious buildings.

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme:

1. The Great Pyramid of Giza: Primarily a tomb, partially underground, but not primarily a ceremonial space in the same way.
2. The Pantheon in Rome:  Above-ground temple, later church.
3. A Jain temple in Rajasthan: Could be above or below ground. Need to consider the likelihood of it being subterranean. Some Jain temples are cave temples.
4. The Parthenon in Athens: Above-ground temple.
5. A Hindu temple in India: Could be above or below ground. Need to consider the likelihood of it being subterranean. Some Hindu temples are cave temples.
6. The Temple of Heaven in Beijing: Above-ground complex.
7. The Mithraeum in London, England:  Underground Roman cult site.
8. A Zoroastrian fire temple in Iran:  Likely above ground, focused on open fire.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
