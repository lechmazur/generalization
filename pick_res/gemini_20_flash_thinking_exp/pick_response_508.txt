The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples depict personified abstract concepts or natural forces as human-like figures with symbolic attributes.

The anti-examples are related to symbolic representations but are not personifications of abstract concepts in the same way.

Therefore, the specific theme is the **personification of abstract concepts or natural forces as human-like figures with symbolic attributes.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A hieroglyphic figure:** Could be a personification, but lacks the clear human-like form and symbolic attributes in the same way as the examples. Likely a broader symbolic representation.
2. **A realistic painting of an angel:** Angels are often personifications of divine will, but the examples focus on more fundamental concepts. Close, but not quite the same.
3. **A mascot costume:**  Often a personification of a team or brand, not necessarily an abstract concept or natural force.
4. **A stylized illustration of Justice as a blindfolded woman with exaggerated scales and sword:** This directly matches the theme. Justice is an abstract concept, and the depiction is a human-like figure with symbolic attributes.
5. **The Statue of Liberty:**  A symbolic figure, but more of a national symbol than a personification of an abstract concept in the same vein as the examples.
6. **A corporate logo featuring an eagle:**  Symbolic, but not a personification of an abstract concept or natural force in the way the examples are.
7. **A stone gargoyle:**  A decorative figure, often grotesque, but not necessarily a personification of an abstract concept.
8. **A coat of arms:**  Symbolic, representing a family or entity, but not a personification of an abstract concept or natural force.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
