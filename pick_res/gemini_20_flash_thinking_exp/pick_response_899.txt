The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest a slow, natural process of change or growth over a long period.
Anti-examples suggest a sudden, impactful event causing change.

The specific theme seems to be **slow, natural, gradual change or growth of a natural entity over a long timescale**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of any kind of change.

1. **a tsunami reshaping a coastline**: This is a sudden, impactful event, similar to the anti-examples. Low score.
2. **a rock being crushed into sand by machinery**: This is an artificial process, not natural. Low score.
3. **a tornado altering a town**: This is a sudden, impactful event, similar to the anti-examples. Low score.
4. **a forest fire altering a landscape**: This is a relatively sudden event, although it can have long-term effects. It's more natural than machinery but still not gradual. Low to mid score.
5. **a tree falling in a storm**: This is a relatively sudden event. Low score.
6. **a river carving a canyon over millennia**: This is a slow, natural process over a long timescale, directly matching the theme. High score.
7. **a geyser erupting**: This is a relatively sudden event. Low score.
8. **a volcano erupting**: This is a sudden, impactful event. Low score.

Let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
