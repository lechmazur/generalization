The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples (Tor network, Bitcoin, Distributed Hash Tables) all share the characteristic of being **decentralized and distributed systems**.

The anti-examples (Traditional banking systems, Centralized database systems, Government-controlled media) are all **centralized systems**.

Therefore, the specific theme is **decentralized and distributed systems**.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this theme:

1. **Mesh networks:**  These are inherently decentralized and distributed. High match.
2. **Corporate hierarchical structure:** This is a centralized structure. Low match.
3. **Internet Service Providers (ISPs):** While the internet itself is distributed, ISPs operate with a degree of centralization in their infrastructure and control. Moderate to low match.
4. **Traditional energy grids:**  These are largely centralized systems with power generation and distribution controlled by central entities. Low match.
5. **National postal services:** These operate with a centralized infrastructure and management. Low match.
6. **Traditional voting systems:**  While there are distributed aspects (polling stations), the core infrastructure and tabulation are often centralized. Moderate to low match.
7. **Water distribution systems:** These are typically centralized systems managed by utilities. Low match.
8. **Client-server model:** This model inherently involves a central server, making it a centralized system. Low match.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
