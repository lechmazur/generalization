The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit *that specific theme*, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations that might include the anti-examples.

The examples seem to represent paradigm shifts in scientific understanding that fundamentally changed the way a field is understood.

The anti-examples, while significant scientific advancements, seem to represent advancements *within* an existing paradigm or the development of a new technology based on existing scientific understanding.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Fundamental paradigm shifts in scientific understanding that revolutionized a field.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **The establishment of the internet:**  More of a technological and social development than a fundamental scientific paradigm shift. Score: 2
2. **The creation of the first computer:**  A technological invention, not a fundamental shift in scientific understanding. Score: 1
3. **The invention of the printing press:** A technological invention with significant social impact, but not a scientific paradigm shift. Score: 0
4. **The discovery of penicillin:** A significant scientific discovery, but it didn't fundamentally alter the core understanding of biology in the same way as evolution. More of an advancement within existing biological frameworks. Score: 4
5. **The shift to object-oriented programming in computer science:** A significant development in computer science, but more about methodology and engineering than a fundamental scientific paradigm shift. Score: 3
6. **The discovery of the electron:** This was a fundamental discovery that changed our understanding of the atom and the nature of electricity, leading to a significant shift in physics. Score: 8
7. **The creation of the World Wide Web:**  A technological development built upon the internet. Not a fundamental scientific paradigm shift. Score: 1
8. **The creation of the steam engine:** A technological invention based on existing scientific principles. Not a fundamental scientific paradigm shift. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>2</score>
