The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are physical locations involved in the sorting and distribution of physical items or people. The anti-examples are abstract networks for the transmission of information or energy.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples. I need to assign a score from 0 to 10 for each candidate, reflecting the strength of its match to the specific theme.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **telephone switchboard:**  Deals with the connection and routing of calls. Closer to the physical routing aspect of the examples than the abstract nature of the anti-examples.
*   **social network:**  An abstract network for social connections. Fits the broader theme of networks but not the specific theme.
*   **highway network:**  A physical network for the movement of vehicles and people. Strong match to the specific theme.
*   **subway system:**  A physical network for the movement of people. Strong match to the specific theme.
*   **lymphatic system:**  A biological network for fluid transport. Has a physical component but is internal to the body, less like the public-facing examples.
*   **neural network:**  An abstract network for information processing. Fits the broader theme but not the specific theme.
*   **blood vessels:**  A biological network for fluid transport. Similar to the lymphatic system.
*   **pipeline network:**  A physical network for the transport of materials. Strong match to the specific theme.<number>1</number><score>7</score>
