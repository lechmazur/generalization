The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: The Bull and Bear Pub, The White Horse Inn, The Dolphin Shopping Centre
Anti-examples: Dove soap, Puma sportswear, Penguin Books

The examples seem to be names of establishments, specifically those that might be named after animals. The anti-examples are brands, not establishments. The key is that the examples are *places* with animal names.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. The Hornets basketball team - This is a team, not an establishment. It has an animal name. Closer than the anti-examples, but not quite the same.
2. The Lions rugby team - Similar to the Hornets, a team with an animal name.
3. Swansea City football club - This is a team name, but doesn't have an animal in the name.
4. Cobra beer - This is a brand, like the anti-examples, but it has an animal name.
5. The Rams football team - A team with an animal name.
6. The Eagles band - A band, not an establishment, but has an animal name.
7. The Bears baseball team - A team with an animal name.
8. Caterpillar construction equipment - A brand, like the anti-examples, and has an animal name.

Scoring:
- High scores for places with animal names.
- Medium scores for teams with animal names.
- Low scores for brands, even with animal names, and teams without animal names.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
