The user has provided three examples of a specific artistic theme: Vienna Secession, Fluxus, and Dadaism. They have also provided three anti-examples: Performance Art, Street Art, and Surrealism. The task is to score eight candidate artistic movements based on how well they fit the specific theme, but *not* the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Let's analyze the characteristics of the examples:
* **Vienna Secession:**  Emphasis on decorative arts, breaking from traditional academic art, often incorporating symbolism and ornamentation, a focus on Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art).
* **Fluxus:**  Anti-art, blurring boundaries between art and life, performance-based, often using everyday objects, emphasis on the idea over the object.
* **Dadaism:**  Anti-rational, nonsensical, reaction to WWI, use of collage and found objects, questioning traditional art forms.

Common threads:  Rejection of traditional art norms, experimentation with form and media, a degree of social or political commentary, a focus on the concept or idea behind the art.

Now let's analyze the anti-examples and why they are *not* the specific theme:
* **Performance Art:**  Focus on live action and the artist's body as a medium. While Fluxus has performance elements, not all performance art fits the specific characteristics of the examples.
* **Street Art:**  Art created in public spaces, often unsanctioned. While some Dadaist actions might have taken place in public, the core focus is different.
* **Surrealism:**  Exploration of the subconscious, dreamlike imagery, often highly representational in a bizarre way. While Dadaism shares some anti-rationality, Surrealism has a different aesthetic and focus.

The core theme seems to be early 20th-century avant-garde movements that challenged traditional art forms with a focus on concept, experimentation, and often a degree of social critique.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **Conceptual Art:**  Strong emphasis on the idea or concept behind the artwork. Shares the focus on the idea over the object with Fluxus and Dada. High score.
2. **Impressionism:**  Focus on capturing fleeting moments and light, a break from academic painting, but not as radical in its rejection of traditional forms as the examples. Lower score.
3. **Minimalism:**  Emphasis on simplicity and reduction of form. While it shares a rejection of traditional ornamentation with the Vienna Secession, its core principles are different. Mid-range score.
4. **Outsider Art:**  Art created by individuals outside the mainstream art world. While some figures associated with the examples might be considered "outsiders," this isn't a defining characteristic of the theme itself. Lower score.
5. **Pop Art:**  Incorporates imagery from popular culture and mass media. While it challenges traditional art hierarchies, its aesthetic and focus differ from the examples. Mid-range score.
6. **Installation Art:**  Artworks created for a specific space, often immersive. While some works by the example movements could be considered installations, it's not the defining characteristic. Mid-range score.
7. **Abstract Expressionism:**  Emphasis on spontaneous gesture and emotional expression. While it's a break from traditional representation, its focus on individual expression differs from the more conceptually driven examples. Lower score.
8. **Futurism:**  Celebration of technology, speed, and dynamism. Shares the avant-garde spirit and a break from tradition, but its specific focus is different. Mid-range score.
