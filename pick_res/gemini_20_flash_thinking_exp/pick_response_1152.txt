The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: binary code, DNA sequencing, Morse code
Anti-examples: chemical formulas, mathematical symbols, semaphore signals

The examples share the characteristic of representing information using a sequence of discrete units. Binary code uses 0s and 1s, DNA sequencing uses A, T, C, and G, and Morse code uses dots and dashes. The order and combination of these units convey meaning.

The anti-examples, while representing information, do so in different ways. Chemical formulas represent the composition of molecules, mathematical symbols represent abstract concepts and operations, and semaphore signals use visual gestures. They don't rely on a linear sequence of discrete units in the same way as the examples.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be a system of representing information using a linear sequence of a limited set of discrete symbols.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **sign language**: While it uses gestures, it's not a linear sequence of discrete symbols in the same way as the examples. It's more spatial and involves simultaneous elements. Score: 3
2. **sheet music**: Represents musical information using symbols on a staff. While linear, the symbols have more complex meanings than just a single unit of information. Score: 4
3. **traffic lights**: Use a limited set of colors to convey meaning, but it's not a sequence. Score: 1
4. **braille**: Uses raised dots in patterns to represent letters and numbers. This fits the theme of a sequence of discrete units. Score: 9
5. **hieroglyphics**: Uses pictorial symbols. While sequential, the symbols are more complex and not as discrete as the examples. Score: 5
6. **flags**: Use colors and patterns to represent entities, but not a linear sequence of discrete units. Score: 1
7. **road signs**: Use symbols and text to convey information, but not primarily a linear sequence of discrete units. Score: 2
8. **maps**: Represent spatial information visually, not a linear sequence of discrete units. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>3</score>
