The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme in musical composition. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate a list of candidate titles based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples all seem to combine a specific martial art or movement practice with a classical musical form:
- Tai Chi (martial art) + Symphony (classical form)
- Capoeira (martial art/dance) + Suite (classical form)
- Karate (martial art) + Kata (structured movement) + Five Movements (suggesting a multi-part classical form)

The anti-examples are all related to martial arts movies or popular music, but don't combine a specific martial art/movement with a classical musical form.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **musical compositions that explicitly combine the name of a specific martial art or movement practice with a classical musical form or structure.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. "Fight Night" by Hans Zimmer -  Doesn't mention a specific martial art or classical form. Broader theme.
2. "Training Montage" by Bill Conti - Doesn't mention a specific martial art or classical form. Broader theme.
3. "Samurai's Honor" by Joe Hisaishi - Mentions a warrior culture but not a specific martial art or classical form. Broader theme.
4. "Traditional Sumo Drums" - Mentions a specific movement practice (Sumo) and a musical instrument, but not a classical form. Close, but not quite.
5. "Fight Scene" by Ennio Morricone - Doesn't mention a specific martial art or classical form. Broader theme.
6. "Warrior's Path" by Philip Glass - Doesn't mention a specific martial art or classical form. Broader theme.
7. "Traditional Kendo Drums" - Mentions a specific martial art (Kendo) and a musical instrument, but not a classical form. Close, but not quite.
8. "Wing Chun Concerto" by Bright Sheng - Mentions a specific martial art (Wing Chun) and a classical form (Concerto). This is a strong match.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
