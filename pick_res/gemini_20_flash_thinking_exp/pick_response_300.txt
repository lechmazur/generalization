The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples show tools where different parts are joined using natural materials like rawhide, plant fibers, or leather thongs. The anti-examples show tools where parts are joined using modern methods like welding or screws.

The task is to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme, focusing on the joining method. I need to assign a score from 0 to 10 for each candidate, considering the joining method used.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **Plastic toy sword with a glued handle:** Glue is an adhesive, somewhat similar to natural adhesives but more modern. It's not a natural binding material like the examples.
2. **Garden hoe with a metal blade and wooden handle connected by a bolt:** Bolts are mechanical fasteners, similar to screws in the anti-examples.
3. **Bamboo fishing rod with sections connected by ferrules:** Ferrules are sleeves used to join sections, not a natural binding material.
4. **Kitchen knife with a handle attached using rivets:** Rivets are metal fasteners, similar to screws and bolts.
5. **Ancient Egyptian spear with a stone tip lashed to a wooden shaft using animal sinew:** Animal sinew is a natural binding material, directly matching the theme.
6. **Steel axe with a handle secured by a metal wedge:** A metal wedge is a mechanical fastener.
7. **Modern composite bow with limbs attached using epoxy resin:** Epoxy resin is a modern adhesive, similar to glue.
8. **Metal chisel with a handle secured by a ferrule:** A ferrule is a sleeve, not a natural binding material.

Now, let's assign scores based on the analysis:

- Candidate 5 is the closest match.
- Candidates 1 and 7 use adhesives, which are somewhat related but more modern.
- Candidates 2, 4, and 6 use mechanical fasteners, which are clearly anti-examples.
- Candidates 3 and 8 use ferrules, which are not natural binding materials.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
