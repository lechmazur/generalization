The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match the specific theme defined by the examples, while explicitly avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The specific theme is about machines that clean outdoor urban or street environments using rotating brushes.

The anti-examples highlight broader themes like indoor cleaning, industrial cleaning, and vehicle cleaning.

I need to evaluate each candidate against the specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1: Automated carpet cleaner with rotating brushes:** This aligns with the "rotating brushes" aspect but is for indoor use (carpets), making it closer to the anti-example of a robotic vacuum. Low score.
*   **Candidate 2: Industrial dust collector with rotating brushes:** This involves rotating brushes and is industrial, but it's for dust collection, not necessarily outdoor street cleaning. It leans towards the "industrial floor scrubber" anti-example. Moderate-low score.
*   **Candidate 3: Automated gutter cleaning system with a rotating brush:** This is for outdoor use and involves a rotating brush, but it's specifically for gutters, not the road or sidewalk surface. Moderate score.
*   **Candidate 4: Municipal street cleaner with a front-mounted rotating brush for debris removal:** This is a direct match to the specific theme. High score.
*   **Candidate 5: Snow plow with a rotating brush for snow removal:** This is for outdoor use and has a rotating brush, but its primary function is snow removal, not debris cleaning. It's related but not a direct match. Moderate score.
*   **Candidate 6: Pool cleaner robot with a rotating brush for pool maintenance:** This uses a rotating brush but is for pool cleaning, not urban streets. Low score.
*   **Candidate 7: Conveyor belt system with rotating brushes for cleaning:** This is industrial and for cleaning conveyor belts, not outdoor urban spaces. Low score.
*   **Candidate 8: Automated graffiti removal system using rotating brushes:** This is for outdoor urban environments and uses rotating brushes, but the target is graffiti, not general debris. It's closer than some but not a perfect match. Moderate-high score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
