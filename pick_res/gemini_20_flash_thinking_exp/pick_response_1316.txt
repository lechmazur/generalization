The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- Pipe fittings and sections: These connect to form a larger system, are often standardized, and allow for flexible configurations.
- Bayonet light bulb sockets: These are standardized connection points that allow for easy attachment and detachment with a twist-lock mechanism.
- Modular furniture systems: These are sets of standardized components that can be combined in various ways to create different furniture configurations.

The anti-examples are:
- Building scaffolding: While modular, it's a temporary structure and not a final product.
- Train cars: These connect, but are large, complex units, not small, standardized components.
- Chain links: These connect, but are typically identical and form a linear structure, not a more complex system.

The specific theme seems to be **standardized components designed to connect and form larger, functional systems or structures, often with a degree of flexibility and reconfigurability.**  The connections are often mechanical or electromechanical.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. Jenga blocks: Standardized blocks that are stacked to form a tower. The connection is through friction and gravity, not a designed connector. Matches the modular aspect but not the designed connection.
2. Zipper: Two rows of interlocking teeth that connect to close an opening. A clear connection mechanism.
3. Velcro: Two surfaces that adhere to each other with hooks and loops. A connection mechanism.
4. Tiles: Standardized units that are placed together to cover a surface. The connection is through adhesive or grout, not a designed connector.
5. Screws and nuts: Standardized fasteners that create a strong mechanical connection.
6. LEGO bricks: Standardized blocks with studs and anti-studs for connection. A clear example of modularity and designed connection.
7. Electrical outlet and plug: Standardized components designed for electrical connection.
8. USB cable and port: Standardized components designed for data and power transfer connection.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
