The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are ceremonial weapons used for display or ritual, not primarily for combat. The anti-examples are ranged or blunt force weapons primarily used for combat.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "ceremonial melee weapons".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this theme, considering its historical use and connotations. I should avoid scoring based on broader themes like "weapons" or "polearms".

Here's a breakdown of my thought process for each candidate:

*   **Glaive:** While it can be used in combat, some glaives were ornate and used in ceremonial contexts, especially by guards or as symbols of authority. Likely a mid-range score.
*   **Pike:** Primarily a battlefield weapon, long and unwieldy for ceremonial purposes. Lower score.
*   **Flail:**  Definitely a combat weapon, not ceremonial. Very low score.
*   **Morning Star:**  Similar to a flail, a brutal combat weapon. Very low score.
*   **Ceremonial Dagger:** Explicitly ceremonial. High score.
*   **Javelin:** Primarily a ranged weapon, though it could be used in melee. Not typically ceremonial. Lower score.
*   **Claymore:** A large sword primarily used in combat. Lower score.
*   **Battle Axe:**  Clearly a combat weapon. Lower score.

Now I will assign specific scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
