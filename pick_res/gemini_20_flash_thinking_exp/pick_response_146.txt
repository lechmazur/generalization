The user wants me to identify the specific theme from the examples (Straw bale house, Earthship home, Igloo) and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader related themes hinted at by the anti-examples (Refrigerator, Central heating system, Portable air conditioner).

The specific theme seems to be about structures designed for human habitation that utilize natural or readily available materials and often passive methods for temperature regulation. The anti-examples point towards modern, manufactured, and energy-intensive climate control systems.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Passive solar greenhouse:**  Utilizes natural sunlight for heating, similar to the examples. Good match.
2. **Air-conditioned office building:** Relies on active, manufactured cooling systems, directly contrasting the theme. Poor match.
3. **Sauna with electric heater:**  Focuses on active heating with manufactured components, not aligned with the natural/passive aspect. Poor match.
4. **Hot tub with electric heater:** Similar to the sauna, relies on active heating. Poor match.
5. **Space heater:**  A standalone active heating device. Poor match.
6. **Airplane cabin:**  Relies on complex, manufactured climate control systems. Poor match.
7. **Electric car with climate control:**  Uses active, manufactured climate control. Poor match.
8. **Heated swimming pool:** Relies on active heating. Poor match.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range:

1. Passive solar greenhouse: Strong connection to passive heating and structure. Score: 8
2. Air-conditioned office building:  Directly opposes the theme. Score: 1
3. Sauna with electric heater: Focus on active heating. Score: 2
4. Hot tub with electric heater: Focus on active heating. Score: 2
5. Space heater:  A single active heating device. Score: 1
6. Airplane cabin:  Complex active climate control. Score: 1
7. Electric car with climate control: Active climate control in a vehicle. Score: 2
8. Heated swimming pool: Active heating for leisure. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>8</score>
