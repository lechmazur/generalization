The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme.
The examples are: a toothbrush, a wrench, a glove. These are all handheld tools or items used by a person.
The anti-examples are: space debris, a space station, a space probe. These are all objects related to space, but they are not handheld tools or items used directly by a person in the same way as the examples. They are larger, more complex, and often automated or remotely operated.

The specific theme seems to be "handheld tools or personal items used by an individual for a specific task". The broader theme is "things related to space".

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding the broader space theme.

1. a camera: Can be handheld and used for a specific task (taking pictures). Fits the specific theme well.
2. a space capsule:  Part of a larger system, not typically handheld. Fits the broader theme.
3. a satellite:  An automated object in space, not handheld. Fits the broader theme.
4. a rocket:  A large vehicle, not handheld. Fits the broader theme.
5. a space suit: Worn by a person, used for a specific task (survival in space). Fits the specific theme, although the context is different.
6. a space shuttle: A large vehicle, not handheld. Fits the broader theme.
7. a solar panel: A component of a larger system, not typically handheld. Fits the broader theme.
8. a lunar rover: A vehicle, not handheld. Fits the broader theme.

Let's assign scores based on the "handheld tool or personal item used by an individual for a specific task" theme.

1. a camera:  Fits well. Score: 8
2. a space capsule: Does not fit. Score: 1
3. a satellite: Does not fit. Score: 0
4. a rocket: Does not fit. Score: 0
5. a space suit: Fits, but in a specific context. Score: 6
6. a space shuttle: Does not fit. Score: 0
7. a solar panel: Does not fit. Score: 1
8. a lunar rover: Does not fit. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>8</score>
