The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the core elements of the theme from the examples and differentiate it from broader themes highlighted by the anti-examples.

Examples suggest:
- Something man-made that has been abandoned or fallen into disuse.
- Nature reclaiming the structure.
- The structure becoming a habitat for plants and animals.

Anti-examples suggest the theme is NOT about:
- Preservation or maintenance.
- Deliberate creation for ecological purposes.

Based on this, the specific theme seems to be about **abandoned man-made structures being naturally re-integrated into the ecosystem**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, assigning a score from 0 to 10.

1. **A deliberately placed artificial reef:** This is intentionally created, not abandoned. Low score.
2. **An old stone wall that has become integrated into a living hedge with roots growing through its cracks:**  The wall is man-made and nature is reclaiming it. Good match.
3. **A constructed wetland:** This is deliberately created for ecological purposes. Low score.
4. **A vertical garden on a skyscraper:** This is a deliberate design feature. Low score.
5. **A maintained historic garden:** This is actively maintained, the opposite of the theme. Very low score.
6. **A planned wildlife corridor:** This is a deliberate ecological intervention. Low score.
7. **A modern green roof on a building:** This is a deliberate design feature. Low score.
8. **An eco-bridge over a highway:** This is deliberately built for ecological purposes. Low score.

Let's refine the scores to ensure granularity.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
