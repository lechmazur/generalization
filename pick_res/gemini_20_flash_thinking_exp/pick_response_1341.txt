The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not broader related themes.

The examples suggest a theme of **traditional, non-mechanical methods of preserving food, often involving storage in a controlled environment**. The anti-examples represent **modern, mechanical methods of food preservation**.

I need to evaluate each candidate against the specific theme identified from the examples.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Silo:** Primarily for storing bulk grain. While it's a storage structure, it doesn't inherently involve preservation in the same way as the examples.
*   **Granary (modern):** Similar to a silo, but the "modern" aspect leans away from the traditional methods.
*   **Woven baskets sealed with natural resins:** This aligns well with the traditional, non-mechanical aspect of the examples, particularly the dried gourds.
*   **Metal can:** A modern method of preservation, contrasting with the examples.
*   **Canning jars:** While involving jars, the canning process itself is a more modern preservation technique involving heat and sealing.
*   **Cooler:**  Focuses on short-term temperature control, not long-term preservation in the same vein as the examples.
*   **Tupperware:** Primarily for general food storage, not necessarily long-term preservation.
*   **Dehydrator:** A modern appliance for food preservation, contrasting with the traditional methods.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
