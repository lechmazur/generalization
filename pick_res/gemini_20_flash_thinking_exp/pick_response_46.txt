The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme in ukiyo-e prints.

Examples:
- Ukiyo-e print
- Specific artist (Hiroshige, Hokusai, Hasui) - this is likely not the core theme as the anti-examples don't focus on the artist.
- Depicts a specific location (Tokaido, Mount Fuji, Tagonoura)
- Features a specific native Japanese flower (wisteria, cherry blossoms, irises)

Anti-examples:
- Ukiyo-e print with a non-native flower
- Ukiyo-e print of Mount Fuji with a non-native tree
- Ukiyo-e print of a different mountain with a native Japanese plant

Based on the examples and anti-examples, the specific theme seems to be: **an ukiyo-e print of a well-known location (specifically Mount Fuji or a location from the Tokaido series) featuring a specific native Japanese flower traditionally associated with that location or season.**

Now, let's evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. An ukiyo-e print of Mount Fuji with a non-plant element like a building: Ukiyo-e, Mount Fuji, but no specific native flower.
2. An ukiyo-e print of Mount Fuji with a non-plant element like a bird: Ukiyo-e, Mount Fuji, but no specific native flower.
3. A digital art piece of Mount Fuji with a non-native plant: Mount Fuji and a plant, but not ukiyo-e and non-native.
4. An ukiyo-e print of a different mountain with a non-native plant: Ukiyo-e, but different mountain and non-native plant.
5. Kuniyoshi's "Mount Fuji and the Sea of Trees" with Japanese maple: Ukiyo-e, Mount Fuji, native Japanese plant (maple is native).
6. A print of Mount Fuji with a native Japanese plant but not in ukiyo-e style: Mount Fuji, native plant, but not ukiyo-e.
7. A sketch of Mount Fuji with a native Japanese plant but not in ukiyo-e style: Mount Fuji, native plant, but not ukiyo-e.
8. An ukiyo-e print of Mount Fuji with a native Japanese animal: Ukiyo-e, Mount Fuji, but no specific native flower.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
