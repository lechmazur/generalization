The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Cross-staff", "Astrolabe", and "Quadrant". The anti-examples are "Astrolabe quadrant", "Sextant", and "Octant".

The examples are all historical navigational instruments used for measuring angles, particularly the altitude of celestial bodies. The anti-examples are also navigational instruments, but they are either variations of the examples (Astrolabe quadrant) or later, more advanced instruments that replaced the earlier ones (Sextant, Octant).

The specific theme seems to be *early navigational instruments for measuring angles, particularly altitude, that predate the sextant and octant*.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of general navigational instruments.

1. **Celestial globe**:  Represents the celestial sphere, not primarily for angle measurement in navigation. Related but not the specific theme.
2. **Chronometer**: Measures time, crucial for navigation but not directly for angle measurement. Related but not the specific theme.
3. **Compass**: Indicates direction, not angle measurement. Related but not the specific theme.
4. **Marine chronometer**:  Measures time at sea, even further from the specific theme than a regular chronometer.
5. **Backstaff**:  An early navigational instrument for measuring altitude, similar to the examples.
6. **Alidade**: A sighting device used on various instruments, including some of the examples. Closer to the theme.
7. **Armillary sphere**: A model of celestial circles, more for demonstration than direct navigation. Related but not the specific theme.
8. **Star chart**: A map of stars, used for identification but not direct angle measurement with an instrument. Related but not the specific theme.
