The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they match the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- truncated cube
- truncated icosahedron
- truncated octahedron

These are all Archimedean solids formed by truncating the vertices of Platonic solids. The truncation is uniform, meaning the same amount is cut off each vertex, resulting in regular polygons for the new faces.

The anti-examples are:
- truncated dodecahedron with unequal edge lengths
- truncated tetrahedron with irregular hexagons
- truncated dodecahedron with irregular faces

These highlight that the specific theme requires:
- Uniform truncation (equal edge lengths)
- Regular polygons as the new faces

Therefore, the specific theme is "uniformly truncated Platonic solids".

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. cuboctahedron: This is formed by cantellation (edge truncation) of a cube or octahedron, not vertex truncation. It's related but not a direct example of the specific theme.
2. rhombicuboctahedron: This is formed by expansion of a cuboctahedron, or by cantitruncation of a cube or octahedron. It's more complex than a simple truncation.
3. augmented truncated cube: This is a truncated cube with an additional pyramid attached. It's not a uniform truncation of a Platonic solid.
4. great rhombicosidodecahedron: This is formed by cantitruncation of an icosidodecahedron. It's a more complex operation than simple truncation and involves a dual polyhedron.
5. truncated tetrahedron: This is a uniformly truncated Platonic solid (tetrahedron).
6. partially truncated icosahedron: This implies non-uniform truncation, which violates the specific theme.
7. snub cube: This is formed by a different operation (alternation of a cantellated cube).
8. great truncated cuboctahedron: This is a truncation of a cuboctahedron, which is not a Platonic solid.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
<number>2</number><score>2</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>
<number>4</number><score>1</score>
<number>5</number><score>8</score>
<number>6</number><score>4</score>
<number>7</number><score>2</score>
