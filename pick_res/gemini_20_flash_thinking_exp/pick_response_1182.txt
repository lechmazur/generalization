The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the core characteristics of the theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches this specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

The core characteristics of the theme seem to be:
- **Adaptive/Dynamic:** The system adjusts its operation based on real-time conditions.
- **Modular:** The system is composed of interchangeable or reconfigurable components.
- **Sensor-driven:** The system uses sensors to gather information about the environment or its own state.

The anti-examples represent systems that are:
- **Fixed:**  They lack the ability to adapt or change configuration.
- **Non-modular:** Their components are not designed for easy replacement or reconfiguration.
- **Predetermined:** Their operation is based on fixed rules or schedules, not real-time input.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against these core characteristics, assigning a score from 0 to 10.

Candidate 1: Standard HVAC system without smart controls - Lacks adaptivity and modularity.
Candidate 2: Non-modular solar panel installation - Lacks modularity and adaptivity.
Candidate 3: Non-adaptive lighting system - Lacks adaptivity.
Candidate 4: Traditional telephone network with fixed lines - Lacks adaptivity and modularity.
Candidate 5: Fixed-layout factory assembly line - Lacks adaptivity and modularity.
Candidate 6: Fixed-configuration data center - Lacks adaptivity and modularity.
Candidate 7: Non-adjustable irrigation system - Lacks adaptivity.
Candidate 8: Smart grid systems with modular energy storage - Exhibits adaptivity, modularity, and likely uses sensors.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
