The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by the provided examples, while explicitly avoiding broader, related themes hinted at by the anti-examples.

The core of the specific theme seems to be an object imbued with the *essence* or *spirit* of a person, granting the user of that object access to some aspect of that person's abilities, creativity, or perspective.

The anti-examples represent ways to preserve a person's memory or legacy, but without the direct, almost magical, transfer of essence.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on whether it fits the "essence transfer" aspect of the specific theme, and not just the "preserving memory" aspect of the broader theme.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

1. **Memoir:**  Focuses on recounting experiences, not directly transferring the leader's essence or skills. Likely a low score.
2. **Portrait:** Could be argued that it captures a likeness, but doesn't inherently grant access to the person's abilities or perspective in the same way as the examples. Mid-range score.
3. **Diary:**  This is close. "Captures the soul" aligns with the theme. High score.
4. **Film biography:**  Similar to a memoir, it depicts a life, but doesn't transfer essence. Low score.
5. **Diary (soldier):**  Like the previous diary, it captures personal experience and potentially insights. High score.
6. **Documentary:**  Records achievements, but doesn't transfer the scientist's essence. Low score.
7. **VR experience:**  This is interesting. "Simulates a person's life journey" could be interpreted as allowing someone to experience a semblance of that person's perspective. Mid-to-high score.
8. **Letters:**  Preserve thoughts and feelings, but don't necessarily grant access to the author's abilities or perspective in the same way as the examples. Mid-range score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
