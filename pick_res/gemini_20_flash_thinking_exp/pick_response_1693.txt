The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples (Underwater ridge, Seamount, Guyot) are all natural, geologically formed underwater features. They are distinct, elevated features on the ocean floor.

The anti-examples (Artificial reef, Underwater volcano, Coral reef) are related but distinct. Artificial reefs are man-made. Underwater volcanoes are processes, not necessarily the resulting landform (though seamounts are volcanic). Coral reefs are biological structures.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **naturally formed, distinct, elevated geological features on the ocean floor**.

I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **Continental shelf:**  A broad, relatively shallow area extending from the coastline. It's a geological feature but not as distinct or elevated as the examples. Lower score.
*   **Submarine canyon:** A steep-sided valley on the sea floor. It's a geological feature but is a depression, not an elevation. Lower score.
*   **Hydrothermal vent:** A fissure releasing heated water. It's a geological feature but more of a process/location than a distinct landform. Lower score.
*   **Atoll:** A ring-shaped coral reef, island, or series of islets. While it's a feature on the ocean floor, it's primarily biological, like a coral reef. Lower score.
*   **Ocean trench:** A long, narrow, deep depression of the ocean floor. It's a geological feature but a depression, not an elevation. Lower score.
*   **Floating fish aggregating device (FAD):** A man-made object. Does not fit the "natural" aspect. Very low score.
*   **Deep-sea vent:** Similar to a hydrothermal vent. A process/location, not a distinct landform. Lower score.
*   **Estuary:** A partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water. It's a coastal feature, but not specifically an underwater geological formation in the same way as the examples. Lower score.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
