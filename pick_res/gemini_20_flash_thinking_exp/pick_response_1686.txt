The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples point towards self-similarity and repeating patterns at different scales, characteristic of fractals. The anti-examples, while exhibiting branching or network-like structures, lack the clear self-similarity across scales seen in the examples.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific fractal theme:

1. **A human circulatory system:**  While branching, it's not perfectly self-similar across all scales. It's more like the anti-example of a river system.
2. **A fingerprint:** Shows intricate patterns but not necessarily self-similarity across vastly different scales.
3. **A lightning strike:** Exhibits branching patterns, but the branching isn't strictly self-similar in the same way as the examples.
4. **A sunflower head:**  Displays a spiral pattern, which is related to fractals but not the same branching structure.
5. **A human brain:**  Has complex folds and structures, but not the clear self-similarity of the examples.
6. **A nautilus shell:**  Demonstrates a logarithmic spiral, a mathematical concept related to fractals and self-similarity.
7. **A fractal image generated by a computer:** This is a direct example of the theme.
8. **A snowflake:**  Exhibits intricate, self-similar branching patterns.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range:

1. Circulatory system:  More like an anti-example, but has some branching. Score: 3
2. Fingerprint: Intricate pattern, but not clearly fractal. Score: 4
3. Lightning strike: Branching, but less structured than the examples. Score: 5
4. Sunflower head: Spiral pattern, related but not the same. Score: 6
5. Human brain: Complex but not clearly self-similar. Score: 2
6. Nautilus shell: Logarithmic spiral, a form of self-similarity. Score: 8
7. Fractal image: Direct example. Score: 10
8. Snowflake: Clear self-similar branching. Score: 9<number>1</number><score>3</score>
