The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are all intermolecular forces involving partial or full charges and some directionality. The anti-examples are broader categories of intermolecular forces or a type of covalent bond. The specific theme seems to be *directional intermolecular forces involving permanent dipoles or specific highly polarized interactions*.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

*   **pi bond:** This is an *intramolecular* force, a type of covalent bond. It's related to pi stacking but not the same type of interaction.
*   **ionic bond:** This is a strong *intermolecular* force involving full charges, but it's not typically categorized with the examples. It's stronger and less directional in the same way.
*   **cation-pi interaction:** This is an *intermolecular* force involving a full positive charge and a pi system. It's similar to the examples in terms of directionality and charge involvement.
*   **peptide bond:** This is an *intramolecular* force, a type of covalent bond, although it does have a dipole moment.
*   **covalent bond:** This is a general term for *intramolecular* forces involving shared electrons.
*   **sigma bond:** This is a type of *intramolecular* covalent bond.
*   **metallic bond:** This is a type of *intramolecular* bonding involving a sea of electrons.
*   **disulfide bond:** This is an *intramolecular* covalent bond.
