The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and then score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly excluding broader related themes.

The examples all involve:
- Ritualistic practice
- Animal sacrifice/offering
- To deities/spiritual entities
- In open-air/outdoor settings

The anti-examples involve:
- Ritualistic practice
- But *not* animal sacrifice
- And *not necessarily* in open-air settings

Therefore, the specific theme is **ritualistic animal sacrifice to deities in an outdoor setting**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A Wiccan solstice gathering:**  Might involve ritual and outdoors, but not necessarily animal sacrifice.
2. **A Mayan ball game ritual:** Ritualistic, but no animal sacrifice mentioned, and setting is not the primary focus.
3. **A Vodou ceremony involving drumming and dancing:** Ritualistic, but no animal sacrifice mentioned, setting can vary.
4. **A Hindu temple ceremony involving flowers:** Ritualistic, but no animal sacrifice, and explicitly in a temple (indoor).
5. **A modern indoor church service:** Ritualistic, but no animal sacrifice, and explicitly indoors.
6. **A Jewish Passover Seder:** Ritualistic, but no animal sacrifice (symbolic lamb bone), and typically indoors.
7. **The Norse tradition of animal sacrifices during outdoor bl√≥ts:**  Explicitly mentions animal sacrifice and outdoor setting.
8. **A Confucian ancestor worship ceremony:** Ritualistic, but no animal sacrifice to deities, focuses on ancestors.

Now I can assign scores based on how many of the specific theme elements are present in each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>0</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>9</score>
<number>8</number><score>1</score>
