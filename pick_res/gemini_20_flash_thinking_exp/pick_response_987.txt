The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are X-ray machines, radio broadcasting, and motion picture cameras. These all seem to relate to technologies that project or transmit information or images over a distance or through a medium. The anti-examples are Penicillin, Insulin, and Aspirin, which are all medicines. This contrast suggests the theme is not simply "inventions" or "things that help people," but something more specific related to communication or visual/auditory transmission.

Let's analyze each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Phonograph:**  Records and plays back sound. Related to audio transmission/recording. Seems like a good fit.
2. **Photography:** Captures and reproduces visual images. Strongly related to motion picture cameras.
3. **Telegraph:** Transmits coded messages over long distances. Fits the communication aspect.
4. **Television:** Transmits both audio and visual information. Combines aspects of radio broadcasting and motion pictures.
5. **Vacuum tubes:**  A key component in early versions of the example technologies (X-ray machines, radio, motion pictures). A foundational technology.
6. **Antiseptic:**  A substance that prevents infection. Clearly in the same category as the anti-examples (medicine).
7. **Telephone:**  Transmits voice over long distances. Fits the communication aspect.
8. **Gramophone records:**  Physical medium for storing and replaying audio, directly related to the phonograph.

Now, let's assign scores, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization, and focusing on the *specific* theme and not broader related themes.

* **Phonograph:**  Directly related to audio recording and playback, similar to radio broadcasting. High score.
* **Photography:** Directly related to visual capture and reproduction, similar to motion picture cameras. High score.
* **Telegraph:**  Focuses on communication, similar to radio broadcasting, but lacks the audio/visual aspect. Good score, but slightly lower.
* **Television:** Combines audio and visual transmission, directly related to radio and motion pictures. Very high score.
* **Vacuum tubes:**  A component, not a complete system. Important for the examples, but not the same *type* of thing. Mid-range score.
* **Antiseptic:** Clearly in the anti-example category. Very low score.
* **Telephone:** Focuses on voice communication, similar to radio broadcasting. Good score.
* **Gramophone records:**  A medium for the phonograph, directly related. High score.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
