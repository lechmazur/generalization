The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score new candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: pointillist painting, halftone printing image, 3D stereogram
Anti-examples: scatter plot, constellation map, pixelated image

The core idea seems to be representing an image or information using discrete points or elements to create a larger perceived image or pattern. The anti-examples use discrete elements but in a way that doesn't directly form a visual image in the same way.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **a barcode scanner**: This *reads* a barcode, it doesn't *represent* information visually using discrete points. It's related to barcodes, but not the same.
2. **a hologram**:  While it creates a 3D image, it's based on interference patterns of light, not discrete points in the same way as the examples.
3. **a radar screen**:  Displays information using points, but these points represent detected objects, not forming a static image in the same way.
4. **a bar code**:  Represents information using discrete bars, which is similar to the halftone and pointillist idea, but in a linear fashion.
5. **a mosaic**:  Forms an image using discrete tiles, which is very similar to the pointillist idea.
6. **a Braille display**: Uses raised dots to represent characters, not visual information in the same way.
7. **a QR code**: Represents information using discrete modules (squares), similar to halftone but for encoding data.
8. **a heat map**: Uses color gradients over regions, not discrete points to form an image.
