The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are:
- ascender device
- grigri belay device
- prusik knot

These are all devices or knots used in climbing to manage rope, specifically for ascending or controlled descent.

The anti-examples are:
- a climbing harness
- a climbing rope
- a carabiner

These are general climbing equipment but don't fit the specific theme of rope management for ascent/descent.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "devices or knots used for ascending or controlled descent in climbing".

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme:

1. a quickdraw: Connects rope to protection, not directly for ascent/descent.
2. a climbing cam:  Protection device, not directly for ascent/descent.
3. a piton:  Protection device, not directly for ascent/descent.
4. a climbing nut: Protection device, not directly for ascent/descent.
5. a climbing sling: Used for anchors or extending placements, not directly for ascent/descent.
6. a climbing anchor:  A fixed point for security, not a device for ascent/descent.
7. a rappel device: Specifically designed for controlled descent.
8. jumar: A specific type of ascender device.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>1</score>
<number>5</number><score>1</score>
<number>6</number><score>3</score>
<number>7</number><score>9</score>
<number>8</number><score>10</score>
