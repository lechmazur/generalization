The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "theatrical spirit gum", "rosin powder", and "liquid latex". These are all materials used directly on performers for application to the skin or clothing for performance purposes. The anti-examples are "theater mask", "ballet shoes", and "fog machine". These are items used in a theatrical performance but are not directly applied to the performer's body.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader theatrical theme.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **prop sword**: While used in theater, it's not applied to the performer. It's an object they interact with. Likely a low score.
2. **microphone**:  Used by performers, but it's a tool, not something applied to the body. Likely a low score.
3. **spotlight**:  A piece of equipment used in theater, not applied to the performer. Likely a very low score.
4. **lighting board**:  Controls the lights, not related to application on the performer. Very low score.
5. **stage makeup**:  Directly applied to the performer's skin. This is a strong match. High score.
6. **sound mixer**:  Equipment used for sound, not applied to the performer. Very low score.
7. **costume jewelry**: Worn by the performer, similar to makeup or spirit gum in that it's attached to the body for the performance. Good match.
8. **theater curtain**: Part of the stage setup, not applied to the performer. Very low score.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
