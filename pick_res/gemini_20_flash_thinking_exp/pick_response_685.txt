The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples all involve **automation or technology applied to a specific traditional practice to bring it into a modern context or format.**

The anti-examples involve technology applied to traditional practices, but the *output* or *format* remains traditional. For example, robotic pottery still produces traditional pottery, and dance apps teach traditional dance.

Therefore, the specific theme is **using modern technology to deliver or facilitate traditional practices in a modern format or context.**

Now, I will evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **AI-powered systems for creating traditional calligraphy art:** This fits the theme. AI (modern technology) is used to create traditional calligraphy (traditional practice) in a potentially modern output (digital art).
2. **Virtual reality experiences of historical cultural events:** This fits the theme. VR (modern technology) is used to deliver the experience of historical cultural events (traditional practice) in a modern format.
3. **Online courses on traditional cooking methods:** This fits the theme. Online platforms (modern technology) are used to deliver instruction on traditional cooking methods (traditional practice) in a modern format.
4. **Virtual platforms for traditional storytelling:** This fits the theme. Virtual platforms (modern technology) are used to facilitate traditional storytelling (traditional practice) in a modern format.
5. **Apps that simulate traditional board games:** This fits the theme. Apps (modern technology) are used to deliver traditional board games (traditional practice) in a modern format.
6. **Smartphones with apps for traditional language learning:** This fits the theme. Smartphones and apps (modern technology) are used to facilitate traditional language learning (traditional practice) in a modern format.
7. **Modern software for managing traditional farming techniques:** This is closer to the anti-examples. The *goal* is still traditional farming, even if the *management* uses modern software. It's less about delivering the tradition in a modern format and more about using tech to support the traditional practice itself.
8. **Automated systems for managing traditional agricultural cycles:** Similar to the previous one, this uses technology to support the traditional practice, not necessarily to deliver it in a modern format.

Now, I will assign scores, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
