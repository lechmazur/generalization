The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest:
- Originated from a US government/military initiative.
- Initially secret or restricted.
- Later had significant civilian applications and global impact.

Anti-examples suggest:
- Developed by private inventors.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely: **A technology or invention initially developed in secret by the US government (often military) for a specific purpose, which later had a significant impact on civilian life and global applications.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, assigning a score from 0 to 10.

Candidate 1: World Wide Web - Developed at CERN (publicly funded, European). Doesn't fit the US government/military origin.
Candidate 2: Printing Press - Developed by private inventors. Matches the anti-examples.
Candidate 3: Higgs boson - Discovered at a publicly funded research facility. Doesn't fit the US government/military origin or initial secrecy.
Candidate 4: Electric battery - Developed by private inventors. Matches the anti-examples.
Candidate 5: Refrigerator - Developed by private inventors. Matches the anti-examples.
Candidate 6: Synthetic rubber - Initially researched in secret by the US government during WWII. Fits the theme well.
Candidate 7: Transistor - Developed in a corporate research lab. Doesn't fit the US government/military origin.
Candidate 8: Laser - Researched in academic and private institutions. Doesn't fit the US government/military origin.

Now I will assign scores, considering the nuances.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>0</score>
