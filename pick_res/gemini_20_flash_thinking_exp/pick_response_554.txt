The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Triple point cell", "Josephson voltage standard", and "Krypton-86 lamp". These all relate to defining fundamental units of measurement. The anti-examples are "Voltmeter", "Ammeter", and "Ohmmeter", which are instruments that *use* these defined units to measure electrical quantities.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader theme. The broader theme could be "measurement devices".

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **Sound level meter**: Measures sound intensity. Uses defined units (decibels), but doesn't define a fundamental unit. Likely a low score.
2. **Cesium atomic clock**: Defines the second, a fundamental unit of time. This is a strong match to the theme.
3. **Light meter**: Measures light intensity. Uses defined units (lux, candela), but doesn't define a fundamental unit. Likely a low score.
4. **Barometer**: Measures atmospheric pressure. Uses defined units (pascals), but doesn't define a fundamental unit. Likely a low score.
5. **pH meter**: Measures acidity/alkalinity. Uses a pH scale, which is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions, but doesn't define a fundamental unit. Likely a low score.
6. **Micrometer**: A precision measuring instrument for length. Uses defined units (meters), but doesn't define a fundamental unit. Likely a low score.
7. **Stopwatch**: Measures time intervals. Uses defined units (seconds), but doesn't define a fundamental unit. Likely a low score.
8. **Thermometer**: Measures temperature. Uses defined units (Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit), but the triple point cell *defines* the Kelvin. This has a connection, but the thermometer itself doesn't define the unit. Likely a moderate score.

Based on this analysis, I can assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>
<number>4</number><score>1</score>
<number>5</number><score>1</score>
<number>6</number><score>2</score>
<number>7</number><score>3</score>
<number>8</number><score>6</score>
