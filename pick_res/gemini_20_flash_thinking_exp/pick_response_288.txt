The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples are Vibraphone, Xylophone, and Marimba. These are all percussion instruments with tuned bars that are struck to produce sound. The anti-examples are Drum, Snare Drum, and Bass Drum. These are also percussion instruments, but they produce sound through a stretched membrane being struck.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not a broader theme of percussion instruments.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. Tambourine:  It's a percussion instrument, but it uses jingles and a membrane. It's closer to the anti-examples than the examples.
2. Triangle: A percussion instrument made of metal, struck to produce sound. It doesn't have tuned bars.
3. Glockenspiel: A percussion instrument with tuned metal bars struck to produce sound. This is very similar to the examples.
4. Cymbals: Percussion instruments, typically thin, normally round plates of various alloys. They are struck to produce sound, but don't have tuned bars.
5. Bongos: Percussion instruments consisting of a pair of small open bottomed drums of different sizes. They use membranes.
6. Harp: A stringed instrument played by plucking the strings. Not a percussion instrument.
7. Guitar: A stringed instrument played by strumming or plucking the strings. Not a percussion instrument.
8. Piano: A keyboard instrument where hammers strike strings to produce sound. While it has a percussive action, it's not in the same category as the examples.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
