The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and ensure the anti-examples do not fit this specific theme.

Examples: Telescope, Binoculars, Camera lens
Anti-examples: Mirror, Periscope, Prism

The examples are all used to magnify distant objects and capture or view them. The anti-examples involve reflection and refraction of light but don't necessarily magnify distant objects for viewing or capturing.

Specific theme: Devices used for magnifying distant objects for viewing or capturing.

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes that the anti-examples might fit into.

Candidate evaluation:
1. Optical microscope: Magnifies small, close objects, not distant ones. Lower score.
2. Kaleidoscope: Uses mirrors to create patterns, doesn't magnify distant objects. Low score.
3. Spectrometer: Analyzes light, doesn't primarily magnify distant objects for viewing. Lower score.
4. Fiber optic cable: Transmits light, doesn't magnify. Very low score.
5. Magnifying glass: Magnifies close objects, not distant ones. Lower score than telescope/binoculars/lens but higher than microscope as it still magnifies.
6. Diamond: Refracts light, doesn't magnify for viewing. Very low score.
7. Projector: Projects an image, doesn't magnify distant objects for viewing. Low score.
8. Hologram: A 3D image, doesn't magnify distant objects. Low score.

Let's refine the scores based on the nuances.

1. Optical microscope: While optical, it's for close objects. Score: 2
2. Kaleidoscope: Uses optics, but for patterns, not magnification of distance. Score: 1
3. Spectrometer: Deals with light, but not for direct viewing/magnification. Score: 3
4. Fiber optic cable: Transmits light, no magnification. Score: 0
5. Magnifying glass: Magnifies, but not distant objects. Closer to the theme than a microscope. Score: 4
6. Diamond: Optical properties, but not for viewing/magnifying. Score: 0
7. Projector: Projects, doesn't magnify distant objects for viewing. Score: 2
8. Hologram: An image, not a device for viewing distant objects. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>2</score>
