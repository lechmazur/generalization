The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme related to food preparation. The examples involve traditional, manual methods of grinding or pounding food using specific tools. The anti-examples involve modern, often electric, methods of grinding.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not broader related themes. This means focusing on manual, traditional methods of food processing, likely involving some form of impact or grinding with specific tools.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Husking rice with a traditional wooden pestle in Southeast Asia:** This aligns very closely with the examples, involving a traditional manual method and a specific tool. High score.
2. **Crushing ice with an ice crusher:** While manual, it's not directly related to food preparation in the same way as the examples. It's more about changing the state of an ingredient. Lower score.
3. **Using a mortar and pestle to make pesto:** This directly matches the "mortar and pestle" aspect of one of the examples. High score.
4. **Crushing garlic with a garlic press:** This is a manual method, but the tool and the action are different from the examples. It's more of a squeezing action. Medium score.
5. **Using a blender to make a smoothie:** This is a modern, electric method, directly contrasting with the examples. Low score.
6. **Using a juicer to extract juice from fruits:** This is a modern method focused on extraction, not grinding or pounding. Low score.
7. **Using a potato masher to mash potatoes:** This is a manual method, but the action is mashing, not grinding or pounding. Medium score.
8. **Using a food processor to make hummus:** This is a modern, electric method, directly contrasting with the examples. Low score.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
