The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader or related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (Enigma, Odyssey, Apollo) all seem to relate to Greek mythology or classical literature.

The anti-examples (Eclipse, Oracle, Phantom) could be related to mystery, prophecy, or ethereal beings, which are broader themes.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely **names from Greek mythology or classical literature**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **Neptune**: Roman god of the sea, equivalent to the Greek god Poseidon. Strong match.
2. **Thunder**:  Associated with gods (Zeus/Jupiter), but not a name itself. Weaker match.
3. **Da Vinci**:  A historical figure, not related to mythology. No match.
4. **Firefly**:  A natural phenomenon, not related to mythology. No match.
5. **Serenity**: An abstract noun, not related to mythology. No match.
6. **Spectre**: Similar to "Phantom", an anti-example. Not related to the specific theme.
7. **Horizon**: A geographical feature, not related to mythology. No match.
8. **Harrier**: A type of bird or aircraft, not related to mythology. No match.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
