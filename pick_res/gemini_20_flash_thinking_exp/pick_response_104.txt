The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: Uluru/Ayers Rock, Mount Kailash, Bear Butte. These seem to be geographically significant natural formations with spiritual or cultural significance for indigenous populations.

Anti-examples: Mount Sinai (religious significance, but not necessarily tied to indigenous populations in the same way), The Grand Canyon (natural wonder, but less clear spiritual significance and not a single prominent peak), Giant's Causeway (natural formation, but less overt spiritual significance and not a mountain).

The specific theme seems to be: **Geographically significant natural formations, often a single prominent peak or rock formation, that hold deep spiritual and cultural significance for indigenous populations.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. Victoria Falls:  A natural wonder (waterfall), significant, but less about a single peak and less directly tied to indigenous spiritual significance in the same way as the examples.
2. The Great Pyramid of Giza: Man-made structure, not a natural formation.
3. Stonehenge: Man-made structure, not a natural formation.
4. Niagara Falls: A natural wonder (waterfall), significant, but less about a single peak and less directly tied to indigenous spiritual significance in the same way as the examples.
5. Angel Falls: A natural wonder (waterfall), significant, but less about a single peak and less directly tied to indigenous spiritual significance in the same way as the examples.
6. Mount Everest: A natural mountain, geographically significant, but while it has cultural significance for Sherpas, it's not the same deep, central spiritual significance as the examples.
7. Mount Fuji in Japan: A natural mountain, geographically significant, and holds spiritual significance in Japanese culture. This is a strong contender.
8. Easter Island Statues: Man-made structures, not natural formations.
