The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Examples: backgammon, fantasy sports leagues, stock market investing
Anti-examples: slot machines, lottery, roulette

Analyzing the examples:
- Backgammon: Involves strategy, skill, some luck, and long-term planning.
- Fantasy sports leagues: Requires knowledge of players and teams, strategic drafting and trading, and managing a team over a season.
- Stock market investing: Involves research, analysis, understanding market trends, and making decisions with potential long-term gains.

Analyzing the anti-examples:
- Slot machines: Pure luck, no skill or strategy involved.
- Lottery: Pure luck, no skill or strategy involved.
- Roulette: Primarily luck-based, with limited strategic betting options.

The specific theme seems to be activities that involve:
- **Skill and strategy:**  Decisions made by the participant significantly impact the outcome.
- **Long-term thinking/planning:**  Success is not solely determined by a single event.
- **Information gathering and analysis:**  Knowledge and understanding of the underlying system are beneficial.
- **Managing risk:**  Decisions involve weighing potential rewards against potential losses.

The broader theme that the anti-examples fit into is games of chance or gambling where luck is the primary factor.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates based on the specific theme:

1. Bridge: High level of skill and strategy, long-term partnerships and planning. Fits the specific theme well.
2. Snakes and ladders: Primarily luck-based, very little strategy involved. Fits the broader theme.
3. Craps:  Significant element of chance, although some betting strategies exist. Leans towards the broader theme.
4. War (card game):  Almost entirely based on chance. Fits the broader theme.
5. Blackjack:  Involves some skill and strategy (e.g., knowing when to hit or stand), but luck plays a significant role. A mix of both.
6. Mahjong:  Requires skill, strategy, and observation of opponents. Fits the specific theme well.
7. Roulette:  Already identified as an anti-example, purely luck-based.
8. Poker:  Significant skill and strategy involved, including reading opponents and managing risk. Fits the specific theme well.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
