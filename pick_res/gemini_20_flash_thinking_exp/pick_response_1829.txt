The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to differentiate the specific theme from broader, related themes.

Looking at the examples:
- Emerald Bay State Park
- Silver Falls State Park
- Golden Gate Park

These are all named locations that are either State Parks or a large urban park. They are not National Parks.

Looking at the anti-examples:
- Great Smoky Mountains National Park
- Grand Canyon National Park
- Everglades National Park

These are all National Parks.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "State Parks or large urban parks that are not National Parks".

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this theme.

1. Death Valley National Park - National Park, so a poor match.
2. Yosemite National Park - National Park, so a poor match.
3. Badlands National Park - National Park, so a poor match.
4. Sequoia National Park - National Park, so a poor match.
5. Blue Ridge Parkway - While it has "Parkway" in the name, it's managed by the National Park Service. So, a poor match.
6. Shenandoah National Park - National Park, so a poor match.
7. Glacier National Park - National Park, so a poor match.
8. Rocky Mountain National Park - National Park, so a poor match.

All the candidates are National Parks, which directly contradicts the specific theme identified. Therefore, they should all receive low scores. However, the instructions emphasize using the full range and avoiding polarization. While they are all poor matches, some might be slightly "less National Park-y" in their common perception or feel compared to others. This is subjective, but I need to introduce some nuance.

Let's consider factors like the "feel" or common association of these parks. Some are very iconic "National Parks" in the public imagination, while others might have some characteristics that could *slightly* overlap with the idea of a state park or urban park (though they are still definitively National Parks).

- Death Valley: Very distinct and iconic National Park.
- Yosemite: Extremely famous and iconic National Park.
- Badlands: Distinct and iconic National Park.
- Sequoia: Known for giant trees, a classic National Park feature.
- Blue Ridge Parkway:  While managed by NPS, the "Parkway" aspect might give a *slight* different feel compared to a traditional National Park.
- Shenandoah:  Similar to Blue Ridge Parkway in some ways.
- Glacier: Very iconic and grand National Park.
- Rocky Mountain: Very iconic and grand National Park.

Based on this subjective nuance, I can assign scores.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>1</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>
