The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

The examples share a common thread: a material or system that changes its fundamental properties (viscosity, molecular structure, optical properties) in direct response to an external stimulus (magnetic field, damage, light). The change is intrinsic to the material or system itself.

The anti-examples involve systems that react to external conditions by adjusting settings or parameters. The core nature of the system doesn't change, just its operational mode.

Therefore, the specific theme is: **Materials or systems that intrinsically change their fundamental properties in direct response to an external stimulus.**

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of systems adapting to external conditions.

1. **Smart lighting systems that adjust brightness based on ambient light:** This is an adjustment of a parameter (brightness), not a change in the fundamental properties of the light itself. It's more like the anti-examples.
2. **Smart grids that balance electricity distribution based on demand:** This is about managing flow, not changing the fundamental nature of the grid or electricity. Similar to the anti-examples.
3. **Climate control systems that adjust based on external weather:**  Adjusting settings (temperature, fan speed) based on input. Like the anti-examples.
4. **Robots that modify their actions based on sensor input:**  Changing behavior, not the robot's core properties. More aligned with the anti-examples.
5. **Smartphones that adapt their interface based on user behavior:**  Changing software settings, not the fundamental hardware or operating system. Similar to the anti-examples.
6. **Shape-memory alloys that change their configuration in response to temperature changes:** This involves a change in the material's physical structure (shape) in response to a stimulus (temperature). This aligns well with the specific theme.
7. **Autonomous vehicles that alter routes based on traffic conditions:**  Changing a plan of action, not the fundamental properties of the vehicle. Like the anti-examples.
8. **Home security systems that change alert levels based on detected activity:** Adjusting a setting (alert level), not a fundamental change in the system's components. Similar to the anti-examples.
