The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are:
- George Cayley's glider
- Ornithopter
- Da Vinci's Aerial Screw

These examples suggest the theme is **early attempts at heavier-than-air flight**. Key characteristics seem to be:
- **Early/historical**:  Pre-powered flight, or very early powered flight concepts.
- **Heavier-than-air**:  Not balloons or airships.
- **Experimental/conceptual**:  Often not practically successful or widely adopted.

The anti-examples are:
- Wright Flyer
- Modern hang glider
- Glider used in modern competitions

These anti-examples represent **later developments in heavier-than-air flight**. They are more practical, successful, and represent advancements beyond the initial conceptual stages.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely **early, experimental heavier-than-air flight concepts or prototypes**.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Zeppelin**: Lighter-than-air, not the theme.
2. **Hang glider used by Otto Lilienthal**:  Fits the theme of early, experimental heavier-than-air flight. Lilienthal's work was significant in early gliding.
3. **Ultralight aircraft**:  Modern, powered, and practical, doesn't fit the "early" or "experimental" aspect.
4. **Paraglider**: Modern, flexible wing, doesn't fit the early rigid wing concepts.
5. **Biplane**: While early, the example is the Wright Flyer which is an anti-example. Biplanes represent a more developed stage of flight than the examples.
6. **Kite**:  While related to early flight concepts, it's tethered and not truly free flight in the same way as the examples.
7. **Blimp**: Lighter-than-air, not the theme.
8. **Hot air balloon**: Lighter-than-air, not the theme.

Now, I will assign scores based on the degree of match to the specific theme.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>3</score>
<number>4</number><score>2</score>

<number>6</number><score>5</score>
<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
