The user wants me to score how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples.

The core elements of the theme seem to be:
- **Physical manipulation by the user:**  Gears being twisted, tiles being moved, levers and pulleys being manipulated.
- **Direct causal link:** The physical manipulation directly causes a change in a visual pattern.
- **Mechanical/physical transformation:** The manipulation involves physical objects and forces (gears, magnets, levers, light beams).
- **Creation of visual patterns:** The output is the generation of intricate or dynamic visual patterns.

The anti-examples involve:
- **Digital/virtual manipulation:** Painting in VR, drawing on a digital canvas, manipulating virtual objects.
- **Indirect or no physical manipulation:** The user's input is not a direct physical manipulation of a tangible object to create the visual pattern.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it aligns with the core elements of the specific theme and how distinct it is from the characteristics of the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

1. **Touch-sensitive surface drawing light patterns:**  Involves physical touch (fingers), direct causal link (drawing -> light), and creation of visual patterns. Seems like a good match.
2. **Sound-responsive digital art:**  No physical manipulation of tangible objects. The input is sound, not physical interaction with a mechanism. Closer to the anti-examples.
3. **Touch-sensitive color-changing sculpture:** Involves physical touch, but the output is color change, not the creation of visual patterns. Doesn't fully fit the theme.
4. **Interactive floor projection reacting to movement:** Involves physical interaction (walking), but the description doesn't explicitly mention the creation of visual patterns *controlled* by the movement. Could be a reaction without pattern generation.
5. **Temperature-based light patterns:** No direct user manipulation. The change is based on an environmental factor. Doesn't fit the theme.
6. **AR mural:**  Relies on a digital intermediary (smartphone app). The user isn't directly manipulating the mural itself to create the interactive elements. Closer to the anti-examples.
7. **Water flow creating shapes:**  Uses a physical medium (water), but the description doesn't mention user control through physical manipulation. The shapes are dynamic, but the control mechanism is unclear.
8. **Facial recognition changing image:** No direct physical manipulation by the user to control the visual output. The change is based on an external factor (viewer's expression). Closer to the anti-examples.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
