The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples suggest a theme related to:
- **Consistent, predictable patterns or states:** White noise at a consistent volume, the mathematical predictability of the Fibonacci sequence, and the static equilibrium of a balanced mobile.
- **Order and structure:** The spiral visualization of the Fibonacci sequence and the precise balancing of the mobile.
- **Sensory experiences that are calming or focused:** White noise, the visual pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, and the visual balance of the mobile.

The anti-examples suggest what the theme is *not*:
- **Natural, dynamic, or chaotic systems:** A still pond (though seemingly still, it's part of a larger dynamic system), the sound of rain (variable and unpredictable), a rock garden (natural arrangement, not necessarily precisely ordered).
- **Things that evoke a sense of calm or peace in a general way but lack the specific structured or predictable element.**

Based on this, the specific theme seems to be about **structured, predictable, and often visually or aurally consistent patterns or states.**

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **A perfectly symmetrical fractal image:**  Fractals are generated by mathematical rules and exhibit self-similarity, which aligns with the predictability and structure of the examples.
2. **A starry night sky:** While visually appealing, it's a natural phenomenon with a degree of randomness in star placement, unlike the controlled patterns in the examples.
3. **An ocean wave:**  Dynamic and constantly changing, the opposite of the static or consistently patterned nature of the examples.
4. **A bonsai tree:**  While carefully shaped, it's a natural, growing organism, lacking the mathematical or mechanical precision of the examples.
5. **A cup of chamomile tea:**  A sensory experience, but lacks the structured or predictable element.
6. **A meditation cushion:**  An aid for achieving a state of calm, but not inherently structured or patterned.
7. **A dimly lit room:**  A sensory environment, but lacks the specific structured or predictable element.
8. **A yoga pose:**  A held posture, which has a degree of structure, but not the same level of consistent pattern as the examples.

Now, let's assign scores, ensuring granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
