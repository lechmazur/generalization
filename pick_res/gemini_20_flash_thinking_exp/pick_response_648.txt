The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are all about using technology to facilitate communication through visual gestures or symbols.
- Augmented reality gesture recognition systems:  Technology interprets physical gestures.
- Sign language video relay service: Technology bridges communication using sign language.
- Emoji-based communication apps: Technology uses visual symbols for communication.

The anti-examples are all about non-technological, traditional methods of visual signaling.
- Helicopter hand signals: Direct human-to-human signaling.
- Signaling flags used in maritime communication:  Direct human-to-human signaling using flags.
- Semaphore flag signaling: Direct human-to-human signaling using flags.

The specific theme seems to be **technology-mediated communication using visual gestures or symbols**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. Morse code communication: Uses auditory signals primarily, sometimes visual (lights), but not gestures or complex symbols in the same way. Low score.
2. Smoke signals:  Visual, but not technology-mediated. Low score.
3. Email services: Text-based, not primarily visual gestures or symbols. Low score.
4. Traffic light systems:  Uses visual signals, but for control, not direct communication between individuals. Low score.
5. Braille communication devices: Tactile, not visual gestures or symbols. Low score.
6. Instant messaging services: Primarily text-based, but can include emojis. Moderate score.
7. Drum communication used in some cultures: Auditory, not visual gestures or symbols. Low score.
8. Text messaging apps: Primarily text-based, but can include emojis. Moderate score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
