The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples clearly point to optical instruments used for observation at a distance or of small objects. The anti-examples are also optical instruments but used for different purposes (hunting, seeing over obstacles, maritime exploration). The core of the specific theme seems to be optical instruments used for scientific observation or appreciation of distant objects or small details.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of general optical devices.

Candidate 1: A camera used to capture images from a distance. While it captures distant objects, the primary purpose is recording, not direct observation. It's related but not a perfect fit.
Candidate 2: A heads-up display in aircraft for pilot assistance. This is not an optical instrument for observation in the same way. It displays information, not magnifies or brings distant objects closer for viewing.
Candidate 3: A night vision device that enhances visibility in low light. This is an optical device for observation, but the core function is light enhancement, not magnification or bringing distant objects closer in the same way as the examples.
Candidate 4: A thermal imaging camera used for detecting heat signatures. This is about detecting heat, not visual observation in the same vein as the examples.
Candidate 5: A digital screen that displays enlarged images. This displays images, but it's not the instrument used for the initial observation or magnification.
Candidate 6: A pair of binoculars used for marine navigation. Binoculars fit the general theme of optical instruments for distance viewing, but the anti-example of a spyglass for maritime exploration suggests this is leaning towards the broader theme.
Candidate 7: A drone equipped with a camera for aerial photography. Similar to candidate 1, the primary purpose is recording, not direct observation.
Candidate 8: An apparatus used in theaters to enhance the audience's view of the stage. This is about enhancing the view, but it's not about observing distant objects in a scientific or natural context.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>5</score>
