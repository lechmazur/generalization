The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples show:
- A specific historical figure.
- Holding a specific book they authored or that is strongly associated with them.
- The book title is mentioned.
- The medium is a statuette/carving/figurine.

The anti-examples show:
- A historical figure holding a book, but the title is missing.
- A generic figure with a generic scroll.
- A historical figure with a tool of their trade, not a book.

Therefore, the specific theme is a statuette/figurine/carving of a specific historical figure holding a specific book authored by them or strongly associated with them, with the title mentioned.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **Frederick Douglass holding his autobiography:** Matches all criteria.
2. **Rosa Parks sitting on a bus:** Does not involve a book.
3. **Photograph of a historical manuscript:** Does not involve a figure.
4. **Nelson Mandela with his fist raised:** Does not involve a book.
5. **Painting of Queen Elizabeth I:** Does not involve a book.
6. **Bust of Socrates:** Does not involve a book.
7. **Painting of a library:** Does not involve a figure holding a book.
8. **Mozart playing the piano:** Involves a tool of his trade, not a book.<number>1</number><score>10</score>
