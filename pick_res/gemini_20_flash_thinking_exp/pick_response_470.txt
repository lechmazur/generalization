The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme related to polyhedra. The examples are "truncated" versions of Platonic solids. The anti-examples are "omni-truncated" or "expanded" versions, often with rhombic faces. The task is to score candidate polyhedra based on how well they fit the "truncated Platonic solid" theme, avoiding the broader theme of "omni-truncated" or "expanded" Archimedean solids.

Here's a breakdown of how to score each candidate:

*   **Truncated icosahedron:** This is a truncated Platonic solid (icosahedron). It fits the theme perfectly. Score: 10
*   **Snub cube:** This is a snub Archimedean solid, not a truncation. It doesn't fit the specific theme. Score: 1 or 2 (slight connection to cubes).
*   **Rhombicosidodecahedron:** This is an omni-truncated icosidodecahedron, similar to the anti-examples. Score: 1 or 2.
*   **Small rhombicosidodecahedron:** This is another name for Rhombicosidodecahedron. Score: 1 or 2.
*   **Great rhombicosidodecahedron:** This is a more complex omni-truncated form. Score: 0 or 1.
*   **Great rhombicuboctahedron:** This is a more complex omni-truncated form. Score: 0 or 1.
*   **Snub dodecahedron:** This is a snub Archimedean solid, not a truncation. Score: 1 or 2 (slight connection to dodecahedrons).
*   **Small rhombicuboctahedron:** This is another name for Rhombicuboctahedron, which is an anti-example. Score: 1 or 2.

Let's refine the scores to ensure granularity and avoid polarization.

*   **Truncated icosahedron:**  Clearly a 10.
*   **Snub cube:**  It's derived from a cube, but not by truncation. A low score, but not zero as there's a connection. Score: 2.
*   **Rhombicosidodecahedron:**  Similar to the anti-examples. Score: 1.
*   **Small rhombicosidodecahedron:** Same as above. Score: 1.
*   **Great rhombicosidodecahedron:**  Further removed from simple truncation. Score: 0.
*   **Great rhombicuboctahedron:** Further removed from simple truncation. Score: 0.
*   **Snub dodecahedron:** Derived from a dodecahedron, but not by truncation. Similar logic to snub cube. Score: 2.
*   **Small rhombicuboctahedron:** Same as Rhombicosidodecahedron. Score: 1.<number>1</number><score>0</score>
