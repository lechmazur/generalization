The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples point towards devices used to detect or visualize subtle energies or fields, often with a pseudoscientific or esoteric connotation. The anti-examples are scientific instruments used for objective measurement of physical phenomena.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "devices used to detect or visualize subtle energies or fields, often with a pseudoscientific or esoteric connotation".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of "scientific measurement devices".

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **Metal detectors:** Detect metallic objects, not subtle energies. Closer to the anti-examples.
*   **Crystal pendulums for energy field measurement:** Directly aligns with the specific theme.
*   **Rain gauges:** Measure precipitation, a physical phenomenon. Aligns with the anti-examples.
*   **Radar systems:** Detect objects using radio waves, a scientific measurement. Aligns with the anti-examples.
*   **Sonar devices:** Detect objects using sound waves, a scientific measurement. Aligns with the anti-examples.
*   **Thermometers:** Measure temperature, a physical property. Aligns with the anti-examples.
*   **Wind vanes:** Measure wind direction, a physical phenomenon. Aligns with the anti-examples.
*   **Geiger counters:** Detect ionizing radiation, a scientific measurement, but sometimes associated with less conventional interpretations.

Now, I'll assign scores using the full range, considering the nuances.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>
<number>4</number><score>1</score>
