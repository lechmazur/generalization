The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples showcase a contrast between simplicity in one element and extravagance/ornamentation in another. The anti-examples are uniformly simple and lack this contrast.

Therefore, the specific theme is the juxtaposition of simplicity and extravagance within a single item or setting.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader theme of general simplicity.

Candidate 1: A minimalist painting with only a single color -  Simple, lacks extravagance.
Candidate 2: A simple, unadorned clay pot - Simple, lacks extravagance.
Candidate 3: A plain, unadorned wooden bench - Simple, lacks extravagance.
Candidate 4: A simple, unadorned stone statue - Simple, lacks extravagance.
Candidate 5: A plain white t-shirt - Simple, lacks extravagance.
Candidate 6: A simple black and white photograph - Simple, lacks extravagance.
Candidate 7: A simple, single-note melody - Simple, lacks extravagance.
Candidate 8: A plain ceramic bowl with a lavish gold rim -  Simple base, extravagant detail.

Based on this analysis, candidate 8 is the strongest match. The others lean towards the broader theme of simplicity.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
