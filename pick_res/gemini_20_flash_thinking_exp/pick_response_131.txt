The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then score the provided candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- the World Wide Web (1989)
- the theory of relativity (1905)
- the printing press (1440)

The anti-examples are:
- a steam engine
- a light bulb
- a television

The examples seem to represent major paradigm shifts in communication and information dissemination. The anti-examples are significant inventions but relate more to power, illumination, and entertainment.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **transformative inventions that revolutionized the way information is accessed, shared, or understood on a large scale.**

Now, I need to score each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **a jet engine:** While transformative, it's primarily about transportation, not information. Low score.
2. **the iPhone (2007):**  Revolutionized communication and access to information. High score.
3. **a microscope:**  Revolutionized scientific understanding, but not directly information dissemination to the public. Medium score.
4. **a telescope:** Similar to a microscope, it revolutionized understanding of the universe, but not broad information sharing. Medium score.
5. **a radio:**  A significant step in mass communication. High score.
6. **a typewriter:**  Improved personal document creation but didn't have the same societal impact as the examples. Medium-low score.
7. **a phonograph:**  Revolutionized audio recording and playback, a form of information sharing. Medium-high score.
8. **a telegraph:**  A significant early step in electronic communication. High score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
