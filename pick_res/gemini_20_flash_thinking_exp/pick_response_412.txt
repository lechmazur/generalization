The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit *that specific theme*, not a broader interpretation.

The examples all involve:
- A mobile dwelling or structure.
- Designed for travel or nomadic life.
- Historically pulled by animals (oxen, horses).

The anti-examples involve:
- Mobile dwellings but are either modern (RV, mobile home) or pulled by machines (tractor).

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Historically used, animal-drawn mobile dwellings.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **A houseboat:** Mobile dwelling, but on water, not land, and not typically animal-drawn.
2. **A cruise ship:** Mobile dwelling, but on water, very large, and not animal-drawn.
3. **A horse-drawn carriage:** Pulled by horses, but primarily for transport, not a dwelling.
4. **A ship:** Mobile, but on water and not animal-drawn.
5. **A house on wheels (not pulled by animals):** Mobile dwelling, but explicitly not animal-drawn.
6. **An airplane:** Not a dwelling, not animal-drawn, not historically ground-based.
7. **A train car:** Mobile, but on rails and not animal-drawn.
8. **A Vardo traditionally used by Romani people in Europe:** Mobile dwelling, historically used, and traditionally horse-drawn.
