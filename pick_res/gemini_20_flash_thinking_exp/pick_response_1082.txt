The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- The Sydney Opera House
- The Golden Gate Bridge
- The Taj Mahal

The anti-examples are:
- A cathedral
- A castle
- A lighthouse

The examples seem to be iconic, globally recognized structures that are significant landmarks. They are also distinct in their purpose and design. The anti-examples are also structures, but they represent different categories: religious buildings, defensive structures, and navigational aids.

The specific theme seems to be "iconic, globally recognized landmarks that are significant architectural achievements".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **A bridge:** The Golden Gate Bridge is an example, but not all bridges are iconic landmarks.
2. **A skyscraper:** Some skyscrapers are iconic, but many are not.
3. **A monument:** The Taj Mahal is a monument, and many monuments are iconic landmarks.
4. **A stadium:** Some stadiums can be iconic, but many are not.
5. **A train station:** Some train stations are iconic landmarks.
6. **The Eiffel Tower:** This is a very strong example of an iconic, globally recognized landmark.
7. **A theater:** The Sydney Opera House is a theater, but not all theaters are iconic landmarks.
8. **A museum:** Some museums are iconic landmarks.

Let's assign scores based on how well each candidate fits the specific theme.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>5</score>
