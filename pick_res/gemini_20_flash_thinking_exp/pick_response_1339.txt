The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

The examples all show **evidence of a specific, impactful event that caused damage or alteration to an object, and this damage is now a defining characteristic of the object.**

The anti-examples show **natural processes of wear and tear over time.**

Therefore, the specific theme is **evidence of a singular, impactful event that has left a lasting mark on an object.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **A charred wooden beam from a historic building struck by lightning:** This clearly fits the theme. The lightning strike is the singular, impactful event.
2. **A sun-bleached billboard:** This is more of a gradual process, like the anti-examples.
3. **A moth-eaten sweater:**  While it's damage, it's likely a gradual process, not a single event.
4. **A patinated copper roof:** This is a gradual chemical process, similar to the anti-examples.
5. **A broken window:** This could be from a single event (impact).
6. **A water-damaged book:** This could be from a single event (flood, spill) or a more prolonged exposure.
7. **A torn canvas painting:** This could be from a single event (rip) or gradual wear.
8. **A bent street sign:** This is likely from a single impactful event (accident, vandalism).<number>1</number><score>9</score>
