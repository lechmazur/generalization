The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme, as exemplified by the provided examples, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes indicated by the anti-examples.

The core of the specific theme seems to be: **interpreting meaning from the natural, somewhat random, spatial arrangement of physical objects or substances after a natural or simple physical process.**

Let's analyze the examples:
- Spilled oil on water: Natural process (spilling), physical substance, spatial arrangement.
- Scattered bones/shells: Natural process (scattering), physical objects, spatial arrangement.
- Tossed grains/seeds: Simple physical process (tossing), physical objects, spatial arrangement.

Now let's analyze the anti-examples:
- Animal entrails:  Involves a biological entity, not just a simple physical substance.
- Tarot cards:  Involves a pre-defined system with symbolic meaning, not a purely natural arrangement.
- Incense smoke:  While a physical substance, the interpretation is more about the form and movement of the smoke itself, not necessarily a static spatial arrangement.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates against this specific theme:

1. Palm lines:  Biological, not a result of a simple physical process. Closer to the anti-example of entrails.
2. Arrow flight:  Focus is on the trajectory, not the final resting position or pattern. Closer to the anti-example of smoke patterns, but with a directed action.
3. Crystal ball:  Relies on a medium for visualization, not the arrangement of something. Similar to tarot cards.
4. Oracle bones:  Involves a physical process (heating), and interpreting the resulting cracks (spatial arrangement). Strong match.
5. Bibliomancy:  Relies on the content of the book, not a spatial arrangement of physical objects. Similar to tarot cards.
6. Bird flight: Focus is on the movement, not a static arrangement. Similar to arrow flight and smoke patterns.
7. I Ching coins:  Involves a deliberate process and a symbolic system, not a purely natural arrangement. Similar to tarot cards.
8. Tea leaves:  Physical substance, natural process (pouring tea), spatial arrangement. Strong match.
