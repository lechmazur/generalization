The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are:
- Edinburgh Festival Fringe: A performing arts festival.
- Carnival of Venice: A masked celebration with historical and cultural significance.
- Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta: A large-scale hot air balloon festival.

The anti-examples are:
- Coachella Valley Music Festival: A contemporary music and arts festival.
- Tomorrowland Belgium: A large electronic dance music festival.
- Mardi Gras New Orleans: A pre-Lenten celebration with parades and revelry.

From the examples, the specific theme seems to be large-scale, culturally significant, and often traditional public celebrations or festivals that are not primarily focused on contemporary music. The anti-examples, while also festivals, lean towards contemporary music or a more general celebratory atmosphere.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. Running of the Bulls Pamplona:  A traditional event with cultural significance, but more of a spectacle than a festival in the same vein as the examples. It has a specific focus.
2. Oktoberfest in Munich: A large, traditional beer festival with cultural significance.
3. Rio Carnival: A large, traditional carnival with parades and cultural significance, similar to the Carnival of Venice but perhaps broader in scope.
4. Comic-Con International: A convention focused on comics and popular culture. Less of a traditional public celebration.
5. Carnival of Brazil: Very similar to Rio Carnival, a large, traditional carnival with parades and cultural significance.
6. Electric Daisy Carnival: A large electronic dance music festival, similar to the anti-examples.
7. Ultra Music Festival Miami: A large electronic dance music festival, similar to the anti-examples.
8. South by Southwest: A festival encompassing film, interactive media, music, and conferences. Broader than the specific theme.

Now, let's assign scores based on the identified theme, avoiding the broader interpretations.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
