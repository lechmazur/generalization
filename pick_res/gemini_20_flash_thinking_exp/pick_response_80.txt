The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes as indicated by the anti-examples.

The examples all involve significant and lasting divisions within Christianity, resulting in the formation of distinct denominations or branches.

The anti-examples involve:
- A split within Buddhism (not Christianity).
- The establishment of a national church (Anglican) with political motivations, though it has theological implications.
- The founding of a new religion (Mormonism), not a split within an existing one.

Therefore, the specific theme is **major, lasting schisms within Christianity leading to the formation of distinct denominations or branches due to theological disagreements.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **The split between Sunni and Shia Islam:** This is a major schism, but it's within Islam, not Christianity. Low score.
2. **The rise of the Jehovah's Witnesses:** This is a distinct Christian denomination, but it's generally considered a new religious movement rather than a direct split from an existing major branch in the same way as the examples. Moderate score.
3. **The formation of the Unitarian Universalist Association:** This involves the merging of two existing groups with distinct theological viewpoints, and while it has Christian roots, it's a more complex development than a direct schism. Moderate score.
4. **The Council of Nicaea:** This addressed theological disputes but aimed for unity and did not result in a permanent division. Low score.
5. **The rise of the Bahá'í Faith:** This is the founding of a new religion, not a split within Christianity. Low score.
6. **The formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church:** This is a distinct Christian denomination that emerged from within Protestantism. Good match.
7. **The rise of the Amish community:** This is a splinter group from the Anabaptist movement, which itself was a product of the Reformation. It represents a division within Christianity. Good match.
8. **The establishment of the Quaker movement:** This is a distinct Christian movement that emerged in England. It represents a division within Christianity. Good match.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
