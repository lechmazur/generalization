The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Didgeridoo: Indigenous origin, global recognition, musical use.
- Outrigger canoe: Indigenous origin (Polynesian), global influence on boat design.
- Maori Haka: Indigenous origin (New Zealand), global adoption in sports/culture.

Anti-examples:
- Printing press: Innovation, spread of knowledge.
- Compass: Navigation tool, global exploration.
- Steam engine: Industrial Revolution, powering machinery.

The specific theme seems to be **items of indigenous origin that have gained global recognition and influence in modern practices**. The anti-examples are significant innovations but lack the specific indigenous origin and cultural/artistic/sporting adoption aspect.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme.

1. Telescope: Not of indigenous origin. Focuses on scientific advancement.
2. Inuit kayak: Indigenous origin, global influence on modern kayaking.
3. Electric light bulb: Not of indigenous origin. Focuses on technological advancement.
4. Wheel: Ancient invention, but not specifically tied to a particular indigenous group in the same way as the examples.
5. Bicycle: Not of indigenous origin. Focuses on transportation.
6. Radio: Not of indigenous origin. Focuses on communication.
7. Microscope: Not of indigenous origin. Focuses on scientific advancement.
8. Airplane: Not of indigenous origin. Focuses on transportation.

Let's assign scores based on how well they fit the "indigenous origin and global adoption/influence" theme.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
