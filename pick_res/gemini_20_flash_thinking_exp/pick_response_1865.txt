The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: metal trash can lids, wooden crates, metal graters
Anti-examples: washboard, steel drums, coconut shells

The examples share the characteristic of being containers or tools made of a rigid material. The anti-examples introduce the idea of sound production (washboard, steel drums) and natural materials (coconut shells). The specific theme seems to be rigid, often utilitarian objects, but not necessarily related to sound or natural origins. The material composition varies (metal and wood).

Let's evaluate the candidates:

1. cardboard boxes:  Boxes, but made of cardboard, not as rigid as the examples.
2. metal pipes: Metal and rigid, but not a container or grating tool.
3. plastic buckets: Container, but made of plastic.
4. metal chains: Metal and rigid, but not a container or grating tool.
5. PVC pipes: Pipes, made of PVC.
6. aluminum cans: Metal and container-like, similar to trash can lids.
7. wooden spoons: Wooden, but a tool, not a container.
8. empty glass bottles: Container, but made of glass.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
