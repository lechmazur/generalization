The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are mountains named after big cats or canids. The anti-examples are broader: mountain ranges, springs, and peaks named after large mammals. The specific theme seems to be a single geographical feature (peak, hill, mountain) named after a specific large predator. The anti-examples broaden this to include ranges, springs, and just large mammals in general.

I need to score the candidates based on how well they fit the *specific* theme, not the broader one.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Wolf Creek Pass**:  Contains "Wolf", but "Pass" indicates a passage, not a peak/hill/mountain. Closer than the anti-examples, but not a perfect fit.
2. **Coyote Valley**: Contains "Coyote", but "Valley" is a broader geographical feature.
3. **Hawk Ridge**: Contains a predator name, and "Ridge" is closer to the specific theme than "Valley" or "Pass".
4. **Bear Butte, South Dakota**: Contains "Bear" and "Butte", which is a type of hill. Good fit.
5. **Bear Lake**: Contains "Bear", but "Lake" is not a peak/hill/mountain.
6. **Fox River**: Contains "Fox", but "River" is not a peak/hill/mountain.
7. **Shark Bay**: Contains a predator name, but "Bay" is a body of water.
8. **Snake River**: Contains a predator name, but "River" is not a peak/hill/mountain.

Now, let's assign scores based on the specific theme:

- Candidates with a predator name and a mountain-like feature will score higher.
- Candidates with a predator name but a different geographical feature will score lower.
- Candidates with a canid/feline name will score slightly higher than other predators based on the examples.<number>1</number><score>5</score>
<number>2</number><score>4</score>
<number>3</number><score>7</score>
<number>4</number><score>9</score>
<number>5</number><score>3</score>
<number>6</number><score>2</score>
<number>7</number><score>6</score>
<number>8</number><score>3</score>
