The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are:
- a digital radio transmitter
- a digital telephone system
- a voice-over-IP (VoIP) device

The anti-examples are:
- a fax machine
- a satellite dish
- a Wi-Fi router

The specific theme seems to be about devices that transmit or facilitate digital voice communication. The anti-examples highlight that the theme is not just about any kind of communication (fax machine), any kind of wireless signal transmission (satellite dish, Wi-Fi router), or even just voice communication (fax machine).

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **a Bluetooth headset**: Primarily used for audio, often voice, and connects digitally. It's a component of a digital communication system.
2. **a webcam**: Primarily for video, but can include audio. Not directly involved in the core transmission of digital voice in the same way as the examples.
3. **a modem**: Converts digital data to analog and vice versa for transmission over phone lines or cable. While it deals with digital data, it's not specifically focused on voice in the same way as the examples.
4. **a walkie-talkie**: Uses radio waves for voice communication, but typically analog, although digital versions exist.
5. **a video conferencing app**: Software that facilitates digital voice and video communication. It's the software aspect of the theme.
6. **a radio antenna**: A component for transmitting or receiving radio waves. While the first example is a digital radio transmitter, the antenna itself is a more general component.
7. **a smartphone**: Can function as a digital telephone system and VoIP device, but has many other functions.
8. **a landline telephone**: Traditionally analog, but modern systems can be digital.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
