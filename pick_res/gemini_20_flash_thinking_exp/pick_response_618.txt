The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme based on provided examples and anti-examples. The specific theme seems to be artwork that:
1. Combines opaque and translucent materials.
2. Depicts a ritual or ceremonial scene, specifically involving ancestral spirits, shamanic trance, or divination.

The anti-examples highlight what the specific theme is *not*:
1. Artwork made of translucent material but without ritual scenes.
2. Artwork depicting ritual scenes but without opaque materials.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10 based on how well it fits *both* criteria of the specific theme.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

* **Candidate 1: a tapestry depicting a historical battle:**  Depicts a scene, but no mention of translucent materials. Low score.
* **Candidate 2: a carved wooden mask with opaque paint and translucent resin layers showing a spirit possession ritual:** Combines opaque and translucent materials and depicts a ritual. High score.
* **Candidate 3: a clay pot with no depiction of rituals:**  Lacks the ritual depiction. Low score.
* **Candidate 4: a ceramic bowl with no translucent materials:** Lacks the translucent material. Low score.
* **Candidate 5: a metal sculpture of an abstract shape:** Lacks both ritual depiction and translucent material. Very low score.
* **Candidate 6: a glass sculpture of a tree:** Has translucent material but lacks ritual depiction and opaque material. Low score.
* **Candidate 7: a painting of a landscape with no translucent elements:** Lacks translucent material and ritual depiction. Very low score.
* **Candidate 8: a stone sculpture of a deity with no translucent materials:** Depicts a figure that *could* be related to ritual, but lacks translucent material. Moderate-low score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
