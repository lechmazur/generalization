The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme, based on provided examples and anti-examples. The core of the theme seems to be about objects that temporarily deform under pressure or force and then return to their original shape when the force is removed. The anti-examples highlight materials that undergo permanent changes.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10, considering how closely they align with the temporary deformation and return to original shape aspect. I need to avoid scoring based on broader themes like any kind of shape change.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **Candidate 1:**  Compresses and returns *unless* overstretched. This is close but has a condition.
*   **Candidate 2:** Contours and returns. This fits the theme well.
*   **Candidate 3:** Melts and doesn't return. This is an anti-example.
*   **Candidate 4:** Crumples and doesn't return. This is an anti-example.
*   **Candidate 5:** Bends and doesn't return. This is an anti-example.
*   **Candidate 6:** Shatters and cannot return. This is an extreme anti-example.
*   **Candidate 7:** Bends and doesn't return. This is an anti-example.
*   **Candidate 8:** Melts and cannot return. This is an anti-example.

Now I'll assign scores, aiming for granularity and using the full range.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
<number>2</number><score>9</score>
<number>3</number><score>1</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>2</score>
<number>6</number><score>0</score>
<number>7</number><score>1</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
