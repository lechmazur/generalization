The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples point to pre-Columbian Mesoamerican artifacts depicting rabbits. The anti-examples are medieval European depictions of rabbits. The task is to evaluate how well each candidate matches the specific theme, which is pre-Columbian Mesoamerican rabbit depictions, and not just any depiction of a rabbit.

Let's analyze each candidate:
1. **A painted mural in a Zapotec tomb, showing a scene with a figure that resembles a rabbit, part of a larger narrative.** Zapotec is a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture. This aligns well with the examples.
2. **A Persian miniature painting of a rabbit in a garden.** Persian is not Mesoamerican. This aligns with the anti-examples in terms of being a depiction of a rabbit but not the specific theme.
3. **A Roman mosaic featuring a rabbit in a garden scene.** Roman is not Mesoamerican. Similar to the Persian example.
4. **A bronze statue of a hare from ancient China.** Chinese is not Mesoamerican.
5. **A Greek vase painting showing a hare in a mythological scene.** Greek is not Mesoamerican.
6. **A Japanese netsuke carving of a rabbit.** Japanese is not Mesoamerican.
7. **A Korean celadon vase with a rabbit design.** Korean is not Mesoamerican.
8. **A Viking artifact depicting a rabbit in a battle scene.** Viking is not Mesoamerican.

Based on this analysis, candidate 1 is the strongest match. The other candidates depict rabbits but are from different cultures and time periods, aligning more with the broader theme hinted at by the anti-examples.
