The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples (halter, riding crop, saddle) strongly suggest the theme is "items used in horseback riding, specifically those directly handled by the rider or directly interacting with the horse's back". The anti-examples (harness, girth, bit) are related to horseback riding but are either used for pulling (harness), securing the saddle (girth), or controlling the horse's mouth (bit), thus fitting the "broader theme" of horse tack but not the specific one.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme and avoid being misled by the broader theme.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

1. **Horseshoes:**  While essential for horses, they aren't directly handled by the rider or on the horse's back in the same way as the examples. More related to horse care.
2. **Saddle pad:** Used under the saddle, directly interacting with the horse's back and related to rider comfort.
3. **Martingale:**  A piece of tack used to control the horse's head carriage. While it connects to the saddle or girth, it's not as directly handled as the examples.
4. **Stirrups:**  Essential for the rider to mount and maintain balance, directly attached to the saddle.
5. **Reins:**  Directly handled by the rider to control the horse.
6. **Bridle:**  A headgear used to control the horse, the reins are attached to it. While essential, it's a broader category than the specific examples.
7. **Breastplate:**  Prevents the saddle from slipping back, connected to the saddle.
8. **Vaulting surcingle:** Used in equestrian vaulting, a gymnastic discipline on horseback. While it goes on the horse's back, it's for a specific purpose different from general riding.

Now I will assign scores based on this analysis, ensuring a nuanced distribution.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
