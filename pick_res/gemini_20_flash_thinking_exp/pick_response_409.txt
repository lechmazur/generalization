The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "hand drill", "corkscrew", and "manual pencil sharpener". The anti-examples are "spiral galaxy", "DNA double helix", and "fibonacci spiral".

The core theme seems to be **manually operated tools that utilize a helical or spiral motion to achieve a mechanical function**. The anti-examples highlight the "spiral" aspect but lack the "manually operated tool" characteristic.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the specific theme, avoiding the broader "spiral" theme.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:

1. **spiral staircase**:  Has a spiral shape, but is not a manually operated tool. Closer to the anti-examples.
2. **spiral fractal**:  Purely a geometric concept, not a tool. Fits the "spiral" aspect of the anti-examples.
3. **manual meat grinder**: Manually operated and uses a helical screw to grind meat. Strong match to the specific theme.
4. **spring coil**:  Has a helical shape, but is not typically a manually operated tool in the same way as the examples. Could be part of a manual tool.
5. **ram's horns**:  Naturally occurring spiral shape, not a tool. Similar to the anti-examples.
6. **chambered nautilus**:  Naturally occurring spiral shape, not a tool. Similar to the anti-examples.
7. **nautilus shell**:  Naturally occurring spiral shape, not a tool. Similar to the anti-examples.
8. **spiral seashell**:  Naturally occurring spiral shape, not a tool. Similar to the anti-examples.
