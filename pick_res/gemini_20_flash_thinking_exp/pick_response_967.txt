The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- Police car lights: alternating flashing blue and red (or other colors depending on location)
- Day and night illustration: a clear visual representation of contrasting light and dark, often separated by a line or gradient.
- Yin and Yang symbol: a circle divided into two swirling halves, one dark and one light, each containing a small dot of the opposite color.

The anti-examples are:
- A kaleidoscope: features complex, symmetrical patterns with many colors.
- A tartan plaid: a pattern of intersecting horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colors.
- A zebra: has black and white stripes.

The specific theme seems to be about **contrasting and complementary elements, often in a structured or patterned way, with a strong emphasis on duality or opposition.** The anti-examples highlight that the theme is *not* just about patterns, symmetry, or black and white.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **a camouflage pattern**: While it involves contrasting colors, the purpose is blending, not distinct duality. Score: 2
2. **a butterfly wing**: Often features symmetrical patterns and contrasting colors, but not necessarily a clear duality or opposition in the same way as the examples. Score: 5
3. **a mosaic**: Composed of many small pieces of different colors, lacking the clear duality of the examples. Score: 3
4. **a Rubik's cube**: Features distinct colored squares on each face, and solving it involves creating ordered arrangements. It has a sense of structure and distinct parts. Score: 6
5. **a patchwork quilt**: Made of different fabric pieces sewn together, often with contrasting colors and patterns, but lacks the specific duality. Score: 4
6. **Chessboard**:  Alternating black and white squares, a clear representation of duality and opposition. Score: 9
7. **a stained glass window**: Features different colored pieces of glass separated by lead lines, creating distinct areas of color. It has structure and contrasting elements. Score: 7
8. **a traffic light**:  Uses distinct colors (red, yellow, green) to convey opposing states (stop, caution, go). This strongly aligns with the duality aspect. Score: 8<number>1</number><score>2</score>
