The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme from the examples and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- The Salisbury steak
- The Graham cracker
- The Diesel engine

These all appear to be named after their inventors.

The anti-examples are:
- The Nobel Prize
- The Pulitzer Prize
- The Freudian slip

These are all named after people, but they are not inventions or specific items. They are awards or a psychological concept. This confirms the specific theme is "named after the inventor".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. The Kafkaesque situation - Named after Franz Kafka, but it's a description of a situation, not an invention.
2. The Braille system - Named after Louis Braille, an invention.
3. The Pavlovian response - Named after Ivan Pavlov, a scientific observation/response, not an invention.
4. The Machiavellian tactics - Named after Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, a set of strategies, not an invention.
5. The Darwin Awards - Named after Charles Darwin, an award, not an invention.
6. The Bunsen burner - Named after Robert Bunsen, an invention.
7. The Orwellian surveillance - Named after George Orwell, a description of a type of surveillance, not an invention.
8. The Morse code - Named after Samuel Morse, an invention.

Now I will assign scores from 0 to 10 based on how well each candidate fits the "named after the inventor" theme, considering the nuance and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
