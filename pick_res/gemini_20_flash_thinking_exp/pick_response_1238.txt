The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

Examples:
- Sand dunes in the Sahara Desert: Landform created by wind erosion and deposition, arid environment.
- The Grand Canyon: Deep, steep-sided valley carved by a river, showing layers of rock.
- The limestone formations in the Waitomo Caves: Underground formations created by water dissolving limestone.

Anti-examples:
- A canyon: Broader term than the Grand Canyon, could be formed by various processes.
- A river delta: Landform at the mouth of a river, depositional environment.
- A beach: Landform along a coastline, depositional environment.

The specific theme seems to be **natural landforms that are iconic and visually striking, often formed by erosion or dissolution over long periods, and are significant geological features.**  The anti-examples are more general categories of landforms.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. The arches of Arches National Park: Natural rock arches formed by erosion. Strong visual element and geological significance.
2. A glacier: A large mass of ice moving over land. While a landform, it doesn't fit the erosion/dissolution aspect as directly as the examples.
3. A cave: A natural underground void. The Waitomo Caves are an example, but a general cave might not have the same iconic or visually striking formations.
4. A mountain range: A series of mountains. While a major landform, it's very broad and doesn't have the same specific formation process as the examples.
5. A fjord: A long, narrow inlet with steep sides, formed by glacial erosion. While visually striking, the formation process is different from the examples.
6. A coral reef: An underwater structure made of coral. Different formation process and environment.
7. A waterfall: A place where water flows over a vertical drop. Visually striking, but the focus is on the water rather than the landform itself.
8. A cliff: A vertical or near-vertical rock exposure. Can be visually striking, but more general than the specific examples.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
<number>2</number><score>3</score>
<number>3</number><score>6</score>
<number>4</number><score>2</score>
<number>5</number><score>5</score>
<number>6</number><score>1</score>
<number>7</number><score>4</score>
<number>8</number><score>6</score>
