The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples are "An economic bubble", "The stock market", and "A political regime". The anti-examples are "A stable government", "A robust economy", and "A reliable power grid".

The examples seem to relate to systems or structures that can be volatile, subject to fluctuations, or involve human organization and power dynamics. The anti-examples represent stability, strength, and reliability.

The task is to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they match the specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **A solid rock formation**: This evokes stability and permanence, aligning with the anti-examples. It's the opposite of the specific theme.
2. **A strong foundation**: Similar to a solid rock formation, it represents stability and support, fitting the anti-examples.
3. **A well-built skyscraper**: While it's a structure, it's also subject to economic factors, market fluctuations, and potentially political influence in its development and regulation. It has some connection to the specific theme.
4. **A secure vault**:  This implies security and protection, which leans towards the anti-examples. However, it can also be associated with wealth and financial systems, which connects to the stock market and economic bubbles.
5. **A sturdy bridge**:  Represents connection and infrastructure, but primarily evokes stability and reliability, aligning with the anti-examples.
6. **A dam**:  Controls the flow of water, which can be seen as a system. It can also be subject to political decisions and economic factors.
7. **A consistent climate**:  Implies stability and predictability, directly contrasting with the volatility suggested by the examples.
8. **A fortified castle**:  Represents a political and power structure, potentially subject to sieges, changes in power, and economic considerations for its upkeep.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate, ensuring a range of values and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
