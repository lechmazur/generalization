The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on their match to that specific theme. The examples are Jazz, Abstract Expressionism, and Hip Hop. The anti-examples are Cubism, Futurism, and Pop Art.

Looking at the examples, they share characteristics like:
- Emergence in the 20th century (mostly)
- Emphasis on individual expression and improvisation
- Often associated with marginalized communities
- A break from traditional artistic forms

The anti-examples, while also modern art movements, differ in key aspects:
- Cubism: Focus on geometric forms and multiple perspectives.
- Futurism: Celebrates technology, speed, and violence.
- Pop Art: Uses popular culture imagery and often has a detached, ironic tone.

The specific theme seems to be related to art forms that emphasize individual expression, improvisation, and often have roots in marginalized communities, particularly those emerging in the 20th century.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **Symbolism:**  While expressive, it predates the core examples and has a different focus on symbolic representation rather than improvisation.
2. **Expressionism:** Shares the emphasis on emotional expression but lacks the improvisational and community-based aspects of the core examples.
3. **Surrealism:** Focuses on the subconscious and dreamlike imagery, distinct from the core examples' emphasis on improvisation and social context.
4. **Postmodernism:** A broad movement that encompasses many styles and critiques modernism. It's too general and doesn't fit the specific characteristics.
5. **Impressionism:**  Focuses on capturing fleeting moments and light, predating the core examples and lacking their improvisational and social aspects.
6. **Minimalism:** Emphasizes simplicity and reduction, the opposite of the expressive and often complex nature of the core examples.
7. **Op Art:** Focuses on visual illusions and perception, unrelated to the core examples' emphasis on expression and improvisation.
8. **Constructivism:**  Focuses on geometric abstraction and industrial materials, distinct from the core examples.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate, ensuring a nuanced distribution across the 0-10 range.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
