The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are optical phenomena caused by the refraction or reflection of light in the atmosphere or due to natural elements. The anti-examples involve man-made objects that manipulate light.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **natural optical phenomena caused by the interaction of light with natural elements (air, water, ice).**

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

*   **1. a glass of water:** While water is involved, it's not a natural atmospheric phenomenon. It's a contained object. Low score.
*   **2. a sun pillar caused by ice crystals:** This directly matches the theme. It's a natural atmospheric optical phenomenon caused by light interacting with ice crystals. High score.
*   **3. a stained glass window:** This involves light and glass, but it's man-made and not a natural phenomenon. Low score.
*   **4. a crystal chandelier:** Similar to stained glass, it's a man-made object designed to refract light. Low score.
*   **5. a camera lens:**  A man-made optical device. Low score.
*   **6. a hologram:**  An artificial construct that creates an optical illusion. Low score.
*   **7. a disco ball:** A man-made object designed to reflect light in a specific way. Low score.
*   **8. a magnifying glass:** A man-made optical tool. Low score.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
