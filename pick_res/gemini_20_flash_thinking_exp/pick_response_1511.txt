The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify this specific theme.

Examples share the following characteristics:
- A scientific discovery or event.
- Initial dismissal by *newspapers* as a hoax.

Anti-examples share the following characteristics:
- A scientific discovery or theory.
- Controversy or dismissal, but not specifically by *newspapers* as a hoax.

Therefore, the specific theme is: **A scientific discovery or event that was initially dismissed as a hoax by newspapers.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, using a scale of 0 to 10.

Candidate 1: The controversy over the discovery of the exoplanet 51 Pegasi b in 1995. While there might have been controversy, it's not clear if newspapers specifically dismissed it as a hoax.
Candidate 2: The controversy over the discovery of the neutrino particle in 1956. Similar to candidate 1, controversy doesn't necessarily mean newspaper dismissal as a hoax.
Candidate 3: The controversy surrounding the discovery of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953. Again, controversy is present, but the "newspaper hoax" element is missing.
Candidate 4: When Barry Marshall and Robin Warren proposed that bacteria caused stomach ulcers in the 1980s, many newspapers dismissed their findings as a hoax. This fits the theme perfectly.
Candidate 5: The skepticism surrounding the first successful heart transplant by Christiaan Barnard in 1967. Skepticism is present, but it's not explicitly stated that newspapers dismissed it as a hoax.
Candidate 6: The initial skepticism about the existence of black holes in the early 20th century. Skepticism is present, but the "newspaper hoax" element is missing.
Candidate 7: The initial skepticism about the possibility of cloning mammals before Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1996. Skepticism is present, but the "newspaper hoax" element is missing.
Candidate 8: The controversy surrounding the discovery of the quark particle in 1964. Controversy is present, but the "newspaper hoax" element is missing.

Now I will assign scores based on the identified theme.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
