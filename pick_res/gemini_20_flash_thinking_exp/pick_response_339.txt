The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples highlight sculptures of Roman figures made from specific dark-colored igneous rocks (gabbro, diorite, basalt) and formed from a single piece. The anti-examples use different, lighter-colored sedimentary rocks (marble, limestone, sandstone) while maintaining the Roman figure and sculpture type.

Therefore, the specific theme is: **Sculptures of Roman figures (Emperors or Generals) made from a single piece of dark-colored igneous rock.**

The candidates need to be evaluated based on how well they fit this specific theme. The key elements are:
- Roman figure (Emperor or General)
- Single piece construction
- Dark-colored igneous rock (gabbro, diorite, basalt, and similar)

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **Figure of Emperor Claudius made from a single block of marble:**  Roman figure (Emperor), single piece, but marble is not a dark igneous rock. Score will be low.
2. **Portrait of General Germanicus crafted from a single piece of marble:** Roman figure (General), single piece, but marble is not a dark igneous rock. Score will be low.
3. **Portrait of General Lucius Verus crafted from a single piece of andesite:** Roman figure (General), single piece, andesite is a dark-colored igneous rock. Score will be high.
4. **Figure of Emperor Vespasian hewn from a single block of limestone:** Roman figure (Emperor), single piece, but limestone is not a dark igneous rock. Score will be low.
5. **Figure of Emperor Trajan carved from a single block of marble:** Roman figure (Emperor), single piece, but marble is not a dark igneous rock. Score will be low.
6. **Figure of Emperor Antoninus Pius hewn from a single block of marble:** Roman figure (Emperor), single piece, but marble is not a dark igneous rock. Score will be low.
7. **Portrait of General Marius crafted from a single piece of limestone:** Roman figure (General), single piece, but limestone is not a dark igneous rock. Score will be low.
8. **Statue of Emperor Domitian made from a single block of marble:** Roman figure (Emperor), single piece, but marble is not a dark igneous rock. Score will be low.

Now, let's assign nuanced scores, considering the "single piece" aspect is present in all candidates, and the main differentiator is the rock type. Andesite is the closest match to the example rock types.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
