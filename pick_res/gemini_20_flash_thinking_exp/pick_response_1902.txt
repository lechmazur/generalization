The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme based on the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly excluding broader related themes indicated by the anti-examples.

Examples: Bora Bora, Cook Islands, Fiji
Anti-examples: Tahiti, Samoa, Tonga

The examples are all island nations/territories in Polynesia with strong ties to New Zealand and Australia. The anti-examples are also Polynesian islands but have stronger cultural and political ties elsewhere (e.g., France for Tahiti, independent for Samoa and Tonga). The specific theme seems to be "Polynesian islands with strong ties to Australia and New Zealand".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. New Caledonia: Melanesian, strong French influence. Lower score.
2. Vanuatu: Melanesian, historically Anglo-French condominium. Lower score.
3. Palau: Micronesian, historically under US administration. Lower score.
4. Maldives: Indian Ocean, geographically and culturally distinct. Very low score.
5. Whitsunday Islands: Part of Australia, fits the geographical proximity and political tie. Higher score.
6. Easter Island: Polynesian, but geographically isolated and Chilean territory. Moderate score, leaning lower due to isolation.
7. Solomon Islands: Melanesian, independent nation. Lower score.
8. Hawaii: Polynesian, but a US state. Moderate score, leaning lower due to US affiliation.

Let's refine the scores to ensure granularity and avoid polarization.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
