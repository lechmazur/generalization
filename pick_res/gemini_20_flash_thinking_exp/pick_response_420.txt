The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples:
- mechanical thermostat with bimetallic strip
- pressure cooker release valve
- ball float steam trap

Anti-examples:
- door closer
- digital thermostat
- water wheel

The core theme seems to be mechanical devices that regulate or control a flow or state based on a physical property, often involving a direct mechanical feedback loop. The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:
- Door closer: Mechanical, but controls motion, not a flow or state based on a physical property.
- Digital thermostat: Controls temperature, but uses electronics, not purely mechanical.
- Water wheel: Interacts with water flow, but doesn't regulate or control it based on a physical property in the same way.

Let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. Toilet tank float valve: Uses a float to mechanically control water flow based on water level. This seems like a strong match.
2. Mechanical clock: Mechanical, but primarily measures and displays time, not regulating a flow or state based on a physical property.
3. Water meter: Measures water flow, but doesn't actively regulate or control it.
4. Mechanical scale: Measures weight, but doesn't regulate a flow or state.
5. Smoke detector: Detects smoke, often electronically, and triggers an alarm. Not mechanical regulation of a flow or state.
6. Electronic pressure sensor: Senses pressure, but is electronic, not mechanical.
7. Bicycle gear shifter: Mechanically changes gears, but doesn't regulate a flow or state based on a physical property.
8. Manual water pump: Moves water, but doesn't automatically regulate flow based on a physical property.
