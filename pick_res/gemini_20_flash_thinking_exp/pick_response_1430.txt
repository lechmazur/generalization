The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are Jadeite, Hematite, and Iron pyrite. These are all minerals, and more specifically, they are all opaque or mostly opaque. They also have a significant metallic element in their composition (Iron in Hematite and Pyrite, though Jadeite is more complex). The anti-examples are Turquoise, Silver, and Gold. These are also minerals, but Turquoise is a hydrated phosphate mineral of copper and aluminum, Silver is a native element, and Gold is a native element. The key difference seems to be the presence of iron and the opaque nature. The anti-examples are either not iron-based or are metallic elements.

Let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Obsidian: A volcanic glass, typically dark and opaque. Fits the opaque criteria and is a mineral. Good match.
2. Azurite: A bright blue copper mineral. The color is a strong deviation from the examples.
3. Copper: A metallic element. Similar to Silver and Gold, an anti-example.
4. Cocoa beans: Organic material, not a mineral.
5. Malachite: A green copper carbonate hydroxide mineral. The color is a strong deviation.
6. Cinnabar: A bright red mercury sulfide mineral. Opaque and contains a metallic element.
7. Galena: A lead sulfide mineral, typically dark grey and metallic. Opaque and contains a metallic element.
8. Salt:  A mineral (halite), but typically translucent or transparent.
