The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Examples: Indian Scout motorcycle, Harley-Davidson Model 7D, Model T Ford
Anti-examples: penny-farthing bicycle, horse-drawn carriage, Roman chariot

The examples are early 20th-century personal motorized vehicles. The anti-examples are non-motorized or pre-internal combustion engine vehicles.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "early 20th-century personal motorized vehicles".

I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

1. steam locomotive: Motorized, but not personal and not early 20th century in the same way as the examples.
2. paddlewheel steamboat: Motorized, but not personal and not a land vehicle.
3. Pierce-Arrow Model 48: Early 20th-century personal motorized vehicle.
4. Boeing 247: Early to mid 20th-century motorized vehicle, but not typically considered personal.
5. modern mountain bike: Personal, but not motorized and not early 20th century.
6. Wright Flyer: Early 20th-century motorized vehicle, but not typically considered personal ground transportation.
