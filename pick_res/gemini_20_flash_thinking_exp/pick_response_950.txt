The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are Grace Jones, Annie Lennox, and Prince. The anti-examples are Boy George, Janelle Monáe, and Marc Bolan.

Looking at the examples, a common thread is androgyny and a blurring of traditional gender roles in their public image and performance. They challenged conventional notions of masculinity and femininity.

The anti-examples, while also potentially androgynous or flamboyant, represent slightly different aspects. Boy George is more about flamboyant theatricality, Janelle Monáe about futuristic and sometimes androgynous but not in the same way as the examples, and Marc Bolan about glam rock and a more traditionally masculine presentation with added glitter and makeup.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be about a deliberate and impactful presentation of androgyny that challenges traditional gender norms, often with a strong visual component and a sense of artistic statement.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Marilyn Manson:  Definitely plays with gender roles and has a strong visual presentation. Fits the theme well.
2. Björk:  Known for her unique and avant-garde style, often pushing boundaries, but not necessarily in the same direct way as the examples regarding gender.
3. Siouxsie Sioux:  Strong visual presence and challenged norms, but perhaps less explicitly about androgyny in the same way as the examples.
4. Lady Gaga:  Known for her theatricality and boundary-pushing fashion, often incorporating androgynous elements.
5. Freddie Mercury:  While flamboyant and theatrical, his presentation wasn't primarily focused on androgyny in the same way as the examples.
6. Elton John: Similar to Freddie Mercury, flamboyant and theatrical, but not primarily androgynous in the specific way defined by the examples.
7. Robert Smith:  Known for his distinctive makeup and somewhat androgynous look, but perhaps less overtly challenging gender norms than the examples.
8. David Bowie:  A strong fit. He famously explored androgyny and gender fluidity in his various personas.

Now, let's assign scores, keeping in mind the need for granularity and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>8</score>
