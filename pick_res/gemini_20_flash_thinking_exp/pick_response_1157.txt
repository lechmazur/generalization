The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches *only* that specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples (bittersweet chocolate, yin-yang symbol, double-edged sword) all represent something with two contrasting or opposing elements that are inherently linked or inseparable.

The anti-examples (paradox, mixed-genre film, dual-purpose tool) represent things with two elements, but these elements are not necessarily inherently linked or inseparable in the same way. A paradox is a statement with contradictory elements, a mixed-genre film combines different genres, and a dual-purpose tool has two separate functions.

Therefore, the specific theme is the inherent and inseparable duality of contrasting elements.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **a crossbreed animal:**  Combines traits from two different breeds. The traits are linked but not necessarily inherently opposing in the same way as the examples.
2. **a chimera:**  Composed of genetically distinct cells. This fits the theme of inherent duality.
3. **a Swiss Army knife:** Has multiple tools, but they are distinct and separate functions, not inherently linked opposing elements.
4. **a two-faced coin:** Has two distinct sides, representing opposing outcomes. This fits the theme well.
5. **a fusion cuisine dish:** Combines elements from different culinary traditions. The elements are linked but not necessarily inherently opposing.
6. **a tragicomedy:** Combines tragedy and comedy. These are contrasting elements that are inherently linked in the genre.
7. **a Venn diagram:** Represents sets and their relationships, including overlaps and differences. While it shows duality, it's more about representation than inherent duality within a single entity.
8. **a bilingual dictionary:** Contains words in two languages. The languages are distinct but not inherently opposing within the dictionary itself.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
