The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme and then evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit that *specific* theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: RuPaul, Andy Warhol, David Bowie
Anti-examples: Leigh Bowery, Marcel Duchamp, Vivienne Westwood

The examples suggest a theme related to performance, visual artistry, and a strong, often self-created, public persona. The anti-examples are also artists with strong visual identities, but they lean towards different aspects: Bowery towards avant-garde performance art and body modification, Duchamp towards conceptual art and readymades, and Westwood towards fashion design with a punk/political edge.

The specific theme seems to be about artists who create a distinct, iconic, and often theatrical public persona that is central to their artistic output, often blurring the lines between art and celebrity. They are known for their visual presentation and performative aspects.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Jeff Koons:  Known for his large-scale, commercially successful sculptures. While he has a distinct style, his persona isn't as central to his work as the examples. He fits a broader theme of pop art but not the specific one.
2. Grace Jones:  Strong visual persona, performance artist, musician, and model. Fits the specific theme well.
3. Prince:  Iconic performer with a distinct visual style and stage presence. Fits the specific theme very well.
4. John Waters:  Filmmaker with a distinct aesthetic and persona, often appearing in his own films. Fits the specific theme well.
5. Salvador Dali:  Surrealist painter with a flamboyant personality and iconic mustache. While he cultivated a persona, it's less about performance and more about eccentricity. Fits a broader theme of artistic personality but not perfectly the specific one.
6. Jean-Michel Basquiat:  Neo-expressionist painter. His work is iconic, but his public persona wasn't as central or performative as the examples. Fits a broader theme of influential artists but not the specific one.
7. Boy George:  Singer with a very distinctive androgynous style and persona. Fits the specific theme very well.
8. Lady Gaga:  Known for her elaborate costumes, performances, and constantly evolving public image. Fits the specific theme extremely well.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
