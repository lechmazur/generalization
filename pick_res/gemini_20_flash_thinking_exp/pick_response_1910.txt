The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Fishing spear point made from seal bone
- Arrowhead fashioned from walrus bone
- Harpoon tip crafted from caribou bone

The specific theme seems to be "projectile weapon tips made from animal bone".

Anti-examples:
- Traditional Inuit kayak made from animal skins (whole object, not a tip, different material)
- Wooden bow used in traditional archery (whole object, not a tip, different material)
- Stone-tipped spear used by ancient hunters (tip, but different material)

The anti-examples highlight that the theme is specifically about the *material* being animal bone and the *function* being a tip for a projectile weapon.

Now I need to evaluate the candidates based on this specific theme.

Candidate 2: Iron spear used in medieval combat - Metal, not bone. Score should be low.
