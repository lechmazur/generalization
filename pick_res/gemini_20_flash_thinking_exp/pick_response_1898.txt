The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are "a throwing knife", "a discus", and "a dart". The anti-examples are "a frisbee", "a horseshoe", and "a shuttlecock".

The specific theme seems to be **objects designed to be thrown by hand at a target with the intention of piercing or hitting it directly**.

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:
- A frisbee is thrown, but its primary purpose isn't piercing or direct impact for damage.
- A horseshoe is thrown at a stake, but it's meant to encircle it, not pierce it.
- A shuttlecock is struck with a racket, not thrown by hand to hit a target directly.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **a baseball**: Thrown, but the goal isn't to pierce or directly hit a target for damage in the same way. More about speed and accuracy for catching. Score: 3
2. **a clay pigeon**:  Is a target, not something thrown. Score: 0
3. **a golf ball**: Struck with a club, not thrown by hand. Score: 1
4. **a slingshot**:  Propels a projectile, but the slingshot itself isn't thrown. Score: 2
5. **a bow and arrow**: Propels an arrow, but the bow itself isn't thrown. Score: 2
6. **a javelin**: Designed to be thrown by hand at a target, with the intention of piercing or hitting it directly. Score: 9
7. **a boomerang**: Designed to be thrown by hand at a target, with the intention of hitting it, although it returns. Closer than some, but the return aspect makes it slightly different. Score: 7
8. **a cricket ball**: Thrown, but the primary goal isn't to pierce or directly hit a target for damage in the same way. More about speed and bounce for catching or hitting a wicket. Score: 4<number>1</number><score>3</score>
