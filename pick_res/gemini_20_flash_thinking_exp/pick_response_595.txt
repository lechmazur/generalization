The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

The examples all involve objects made from materials recovered from specific, historically significant shipwrecks.

The anti-examples involve objects made from salvaged materials related to the sea or ships, but not specifically from *famous* shipwrecks.

Therefore, the specific theme is: **An object made from materials recovered from a specific, historically significant shipwreck.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

1. **A painting depicting a famous shipwreck:** This is about a shipwreck, but not made *from* it. Low score.
2. **A sword made from steel sourced from a decommissioned battleship:**  This is from a ship, but not a *wreck*. Low score.
3. **A ring set with a gemstone found in the wreck of the Titanic:** This fits the theme perfectly. High score.
4. **A necklace made from seashells:** This is from the ocean, but not a shipwreck. Very low score.
5. **A bracelet made from pearls sourced from the ocean:** Similar to the seashells, not from a shipwreck. Very low score.
6. **A pendant featuring a map of a famous shipwreck:** This is about a shipwreck, but not made *from* it. Low score.
7. **A brooch featuring a design of a historic ship:** This is about a ship, but not made from a shipwreck. Low score.
8. **A sculpture made from coral:** This is from the ocean, but not a shipwreck. Very low score.

Now I will assign granular scores, keeping in mind the need for nuance and avoiding polarization.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
<number>2</number><score>2</score>
<number>3</number><score>9</score>
<number>4</number><score>0</score>
<number>5</number><score>1</score>
<number>6</number><score>3</score>
<number>7</number><score>2</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
