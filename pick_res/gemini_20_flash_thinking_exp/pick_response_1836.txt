The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match the specific theme identified by the examples: "autonomous vehicles for logistics/transportation". The anti-examples highlight that the key aspect is "autonomous", not just any vehicle used for transport.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on the presence of autonomy and its application in logistics/transportation.

Here's a breakdown of each candidate:
1. **a human-driven taxi**:  Lacks autonomy.
2. **a traditional ferry with a captain**: Lacks autonomy.
3. **autonomous cargo ships for maritime logistics**:  Has autonomy and is used for logistics.
4. **a human-driven garbage truck**: Lacks autonomy.
5. **a manually operated snowplow**: Lacks autonomy.
6. **a manually guided warehouse robot**:  While it's a robot, it's manually guided, so lacks full autonomy. This is a tricky one, closer than the fully manual options.
7. **a human-operated delivery truck**: Lacks autonomy.
8. **a passenger bus with a human driver**: Lacks autonomy and focuses on passenger transport, not logistics.

Based on this, I can assign scores.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
