The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all devices that use the Earth's magnetic field to determine direction.
The anti-examples are devices that determine position or time using other methods (satellites, celestial bodies, the sun).

Therefore, the specific theme is "devices that use the Earth's magnetic field to determine direction".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme and assign a score from 0 to 10.

1. **a satellite dish**:  Receives signals from satellites, not related to Earth's magnetic field for direction. Score: 0-1
2. **a sonar device**: Uses sound waves to detect objects underwater, not related to Earth's magnetic field for direction. Score: 0-1
3. **a geomagnetic sensor**: Directly measures the Earth's magnetic field. This is a strong match. Score: 8-10
4. **a radar system**: Uses radio waves to detect objects, not related to Earth's magnetic field for direction. Score: 0-1
5. **a weather vane**: Indicates wind direction, not related to Earth's magnetic field. Score: 0-2 (slight conceptual link to direction, but not magnetic)
6. **a gyroscope**:  Used for maintaining orientation, often independent of external references like the magnetic field. Score: 2-4 (can be used in navigation, but doesn't directly use the magnetic field)
7. **a altimeter**: Measures altitude, not related to Earth's magnetic field for direction. Score: 0-1
8. **a chronometer**: Measures time, not related to Earth's magnetic field for direction. Score: 0-1<number>1</number><score>1</score>
