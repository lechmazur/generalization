The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples all relate to phenomena occurring exclusively during the period of darkness in the Arctic. The anti-examples relate to phenomena occurring during periods of light or warmth in the Arctic.

Therefore, the specific theme is: **Phenomena occurring exclusively during the period of continuous darkness in the Arctic.**

The task is to evaluate how well each candidate matches this specific theme, using a scale of 0 to 10.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **The thawing of snow in summer:** This occurs during a period of light and warmth, the opposite of the specific theme. Score: 0

2. **The changing of seasons:** This is a broader concept, and while it includes the period of darkness, it's not exclusive to it. Score: 2

3. **The life cycle of a mosquito in the Arctic:** Mosquitoes are generally active during warmer periods. Score: 1

4. **Migration of caribou herds:** While migration patterns might be influenced by the seasons, they are not exclusively tied to the period of darkness. Score: 3

5. **The molting of Arctic foxes:** Molting can occur at different times of the year, not exclusively during the dark period. Score: 3

6. **Changes in sea ice extent:** Sea ice extent is influenced by temperature and light, but the *decrease* in extent is more associated with warmer periods. The *increase* in extent is associated with the dark period, but it's not exclusively a phenomenon *during* the dark period. Score: 4

7. **The nesting of Arctic terns:** Nesting occurs during the breeding season, which is typically during the warmer months with more daylight. Score: 1

8. **A particular type of phytoplankton bloom occurring only during the midnight sun:** This is the opposite of the specific theme, as the midnight sun is a period of continuous daylight. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>0</score>
