The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes.

The examples are:
- Lighthouse lantern
- Overhead projector
- Fresnel spotlight

The anti-examples are:
- Stage lighting (parabolic reflector)
- Streetlight (refractor)
- Projector (DLP)

The core element in the examples seems to be the use of a Fresnel lens for light manipulation. The anti-examples use different methods (parabolic reflector, refractor, DLP).

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "devices utilizing a Fresnel lens for light manipulation/projection/collection".

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **Solar panel (non-concentrating):** Does not use a Fresnel lens. Score: 0
2. **Telescope:** Uses lenses, but typically not Fresnel lenses for the primary objective. Score: 2
3. **Microscope:** Uses lenses, but typically not Fresnel lenses. Score: 1
4. **Car headlight:** Uses reflectors and lenses, but typically not Fresnel lenses for the main beam. Score: 2
5. **Camera lens:** Uses multiple lenses, but typically not Fresnel lenses for the primary image formation. Score: 1
6. **Magnifying glass:** A simple convex lens, not a Fresnel lens. Score: 0
7. **Concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system:** Some CPV systems use Fresnel lenses to concentrate sunlight. Score: 9
8. **Rear-projection television:** Older models used Fresnel lenses to improve brightness and viewing angle. Score: 7<number>1</number><score>0</score>
