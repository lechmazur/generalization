The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples suggest a theme of **renewal or transformation following a period of decline or loss**. The anti-examples highlight things that represent decline or loss *without* the explicit element of renewal or transformation.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on the presence of both the decline/loss aspect and the subsequent renewal/transformation aspect.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

1. **A wilting flower:**  Focuses on decline, lacks the renewal aspect.
2. **An hourglass:** Represents the passage of time and the inevitable depletion of something. Could be interpreted as a cycle, but the renewal isn't explicit.
3. **A phoenix rising from ashes:**  Clearly embodies both destruction and subsequent rebirth.
4. **A graveyard:** Represents the end of life, focusing on loss.
5. **A burning candle:** Represents consumption and eventual end.
6. **A caterpillar transforming into a butterfly:**  A classic example of transformation and renewal.
7. **A funeral procession:**  Focuses on mourning and loss.
8. **A skeleton:** Represents the end of life, the remains after life has ceased.

Now I will assign scores based on this analysis, ensuring a nuanced distribution across the 0-10 range.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>4</score>
<number>3</number><score>10</score>
<number>4</number><score>1</score>
<number>5</number><score>3</score>
<number>6</number><score>9</score>
<number>7</number><score>2</score>
<number>8</number><score>0</score>
