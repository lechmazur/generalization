The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Flowing water", "Dewdrops", and "Autumn leaves". The anti-examples are "An hourglass", "A ticking clock", and "A burning candle".

The core theme seems to be about transient natural phenomena, specifically things that change or disappear over time, often related to natural processes. The anti-examples, while also transient, involve more mechanical or chemical processes rather than purely natural ones. They also involve a more directed or controlled change.

Let's analyze each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Blossoms:**  While natural, blossoms are more about a stage of growth rather than a transient disappearance. They eventually fade, but the core idea isn't the fading itself. It's less about the "flowing" or "dropping" aspect.
2. **A dying ember:** This is very similar to the "burning candle" anti-example. It involves a chemical process of burning and fading.
3. **A shooting star:** This is a very transient natural phenomenon. It appears and disappears quickly.
4. **Bubbles:**  Bubbles are transient and often associated with water or air, fitting the "flowing" aspect in a way. They pop and disappear.
5. **Footprints in the sand:** These are transient and formed by an external force, but they are a record of something rather than a natural process of change itself. They disappear due to wind or water.
6. **A melting ice sculpture:** This involves a change of state due to temperature, a natural process. It's transient and disappears.
7. **A setting sun:** This is a regular, predictable natural phenomenon of disappearance.
8. **Smoke:** This is transient and often associated with fire, which is closer to the anti-examples. However, it can also be from natural sources like wildfires.

Now, let's assign scores based on how well they fit the *specific* theme and avoid the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

* **Flowing water, Dewdrops, Autumn leaves:**  These share a sense of natural, often gentle, transient change.

Let's refine the scoring:

* **1. Blossoms:**  More about a stage of life, less about transient disappearance. Score: 3
* **2. A dying ember:**  Too close to the "burning candle". Score: 1
* **3. A shooting star:**  Very transient and natural. Score: 9
* **4. Bubbles:** Transient, often water-related. Score: 7
* **5. Footprints in the sand:**  Transient but a record, not a natural process of change itself. Score: 4
* **6. A melting ice sculpture:** Transient, natural process. Score: 8
* **7. A setting sun:**  Regular, natural disappearance. Score: 6
* **8. Smoke:**  Often fire-related, but can be natural. Score: 5<number>1</number><score>3</score>
