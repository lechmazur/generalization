The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the theme based on the examples and then score the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

Examples: Reykjavik, Reykholt, Rif
Anti-examples: Akureyri, Keflavík, Borgarnes

The examples all start with "Reyk-" or "Rif". The anti-examples do not. This suggests the theme is place names in Iceland that start with "Reyk-" or "Rif".

Now I need to score the candidates based on this specific theme.

1. Höfn - Does not start with "Reyk-" or "Rif". Score: 0
2. Ísafjörður - Does not start with "Reyk-" or "Rif". Score: 0
3. Húsavík - Does not start with "Reyk-" or "Rif". Score: 0
4. Selfoss - Does not start with "Reyk-" or "Rif". Score: 0
5. Reykjanes - Starts with "Reyk-". Score: 10
6. Egilsstaðir - Does not start with "Reyk-" or "Rif". Score: 0
7. Vík - Does not start with "Reyk-" or "Rif". Score: 0
8. Grindavík - Does not start with "Reyk-" or "Rif". Score: 0

Re-evaluating to ensure granularity. The theme is very specific. Either a candidate starts with "Reyk-" or "Rif" or it doesn't. There isn't much room for nuance here based on the strict interpretation of the provided examples.

Let's double-check the anti-examples. They are all place names in Iceland, which is a broader theme. The specific theme is the starting letters.

Final check of the scoring based on the strict theme:

1. Höfn - 0
2. Ísafjörður - 0
3. Húsavík - 0
4. Selfoss - 0
5. Reykjanes - 10
6. Egilsstaðir - 0
7. Vík - 0
8. Grindavík - 0<number>1</number><score>0</score>
