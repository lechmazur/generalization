The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "Navigation lights", "Signal flags", and "Aldis lamp". These are all methods of visual communication at sea. The anti-examples are "Sextant", "Chronometer", and "Magnetic compass". These are all navigational instruments.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme (visual communication at sea) and *not* the broader theme of navigation in general.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **Nautical chart:** While used in navigation, it's not a method of *communication*. It's a representation of the navigable waters. It's more related to the anti-examples.
2. **Lead line:** Used for measuring water depth. Not a method of communication. More related to the anti-examples in that it's a navigational tool.
3. **Parallel rule:** Used for transferring lines on a chart. A navigational tool, not communication.
4. **Pelorus:** A bearing-taking device. A navigational instrument, not communication.
5. **Lighthouse:** A visual aid for navigation, but also a form of visual communication (warning of hazards, marking locations). This is a strong contender.
6. **Traverse board:** A tool for recording a ship's course and speed. A navigational tool, not communication.
7. **Chip log:** An older device for measuring a ship's speed. A navigational tool, not communication.
8. **Dividers:** Used for measuring distances on a chart. A navigational tool, not communication.

Based on this analysis, lighthouses are the closest match to the specific theme. The other candidates are more aligned with the broader theme of navigation.

Let's assign scores:

* **Lighthouse:**  A clear form of visual communication at sea. Score: 9
* **Nautical chart:**  Definitely related to navigation but not communication. Score: 2
* **Lead line:**  A navigational tool, not communication. Score: 1
* **Parallel rule:** Navigational tool, not communication. Score: 1
* **Pelorus:** Navigational instrument, not communication. Score: 2
* **Traverse board:** Navigational tool, not communication. Score: 1
* **Chip log:** Navigational tool, not communication. Score: 1
* **Dividers:** Navigational tool, not communication. Score: 1<number>1</number><score>2</score>
