The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples:
- Kente cloth featuring concentric circles
- Ankara fabric with circular motifs
- Maasai jewelry with coiled wire patterns

Anti-examples:
- a mud cloth with square motifs
- a mud cloth with cross patterns
- a woven mat with checkerboard patterns

The specific theme seems to be **circular or coiled patterns in traditional African textiles and jewelry**. The anti-examples highlight that the theme is not just about geometric patterns in general, or even geometric patterns in African textiles, but specifically circular or coiled ones.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme.

Candidate 1: a striped kente cloth - Stripes are linear, not circular or coiled.
Candidate 2: a mud cloth with geometric shapes - This is too general and aligns more with the anti-examples.
Candidate 3: a woven basket with zigzag patterns - Zigzag is not circular or coiled.
Candidate 4: a beaded necklace with linear patterns - Linear is not circular or coiled.
Candidate 5: a kente cloth with vertical stripes - Stripes are linear, not circular or coiled.
Candidate 6: Zulu beadwork with spiral designs - Spiral is a form of a coil, fitting the theme.
Candidate 7: a woven basket with diamond shapes - Diamond is not circular or coiled.
Candidate 8: a kente cloth with diagonal lines - Lines are linear, not circular or coiled.
