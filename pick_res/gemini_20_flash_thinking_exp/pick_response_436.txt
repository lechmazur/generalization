The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the core elements of the theme from the examples and ensure the anti-examples are clearly distinct.

Examples suggest:
- Artificial scarcity
- Rebranding/relabeling of mass-produced goods
- Presenting something ordinary as exclusive or high-end

Anti-examples suggest:
- Genuine exclusivity based on access or skill
- Not necessarily involving mass-produced goods

Based on this, the specific theme seems to be **creating an illusion of exclusivity or rarity around readily available, mass-produced items through artificial scarcity or rebranding.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme, using the full 0-10 scale.

1. **A rare coin dealer:**  Deals with genuinely rare items. Doesn't fit the theme.
2. **A members-only cigar lounge:**  Exclusivity based on membership, not necessarily about rebranded mass-produced items.
3. **A "master coffee taster" course that teaches basic flavor identification using standard commercial beans:** Fits the theme well - presenting basic knowledge with a fancy title using standard products.
4. **A limited-run art print series:**  Could involve artificial scarcity, but the product itself is unique. Less of a fit than the examples.
5. **A boutique perfume atelier:**  Focuses on unique creations, not rebranding.
6. **A rare whiskey tasting event:**  Could involve genuinely rare whiskeys.
7. **A first-edition book collector's society:** Deals with genuinely rare items.
8. **A premium sushi omakase restaurant:** Focuses on high-quality ingredients and chef's skill, not rebranding.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
