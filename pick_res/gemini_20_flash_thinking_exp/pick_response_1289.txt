The user wants me to identify a specific theme from the provided examples and anti-examples.

Examples suggest:
- Temporary
- Decorative
- Created for a religious/spiritual purpose
- Made from natural materials (flowers, rice flour, sand)
- Ground-level or floor-based

Anti-examples suggest what the theme is NOT:
- Permanent
- Carved/sculpted
- Not necessarily for religious purposes (Halloween, Easter)
- Not necessarily made from natural materials (wood, paint)
- Not necessarily ground-level

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be: **Temporary decorative art made from natural materials for a religious or spiritual ceremony, typically placed on the ground or floor.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.
