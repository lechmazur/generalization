The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples are all types of wheelbarrows.
The anti-examples are all wheeled devices for moving things, but they are not wheelbarrows.

Therefore, the specific theme is likely "wheelbarrow". The broader theme is "wheeled carts for moving items".

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how closely it resembles a wheelbarrow, specifically considering the single wheel and the way it's used (lifting and pushing).

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **push cart:**  Generally has multiple wheels and a handle for pushing. Not a wheelbarrow.
*   **construction wheelbarrow:**  Clearly a type of wheelbarrow.
*   **pallet jack:**  Designed for lifting and moving pallets. Not a wheelbarrow.
*   **beach wagon:**  Has multiple wheels and is pulled. Not a wheelbarrow.
*   **dump cart:**  Can be similar to a wheelbarrow but often has more wheels and a dumping mechanism. Closer than some, but not a standard wheelbarrow.
*   **platform cart:**  Flat platform with wheels. Not a wheelbarrow.
*   **garden cart:**  Similar to a dump cart, often with multiple wheels and pulled. Not a wheelbarrow.
*   **mail cart:**  Designed for carrying mail, often with multiple wheels. Not a wheelbarrow.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
