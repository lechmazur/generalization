The user wants me to score candidates based on how well they match a specific theme derived from the provided examples, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core elements of the theme are:
- **Prehistoric cave art:** The examples all reference specific prehistoric cave art sites (Serra da Capivara, Lascaux, Chauvet).
- **Direct replication:** The patterns from the cave art are "replicated," "mirrored," or "matched" in a modern form.
- **Modern medium:** The modern forms involve "fluorescent geometric tattoos," "neon body paint," and "UV-reactive spiral mandalas," suggesting a focus on visual impact and often body art.

The anti-examples highlight what the theme is *not*:
- **General geometric patterns:** Islamic tiles, Sanskrit mandalas, and Aboriginal dot paintings are all geometric but lack the specific link to prehistoric cave art and modern replication.

Therefore, the specific theme is the replication of patterns found in prehistoric cave art using modern, visually striking mediums, often involving body art.

Now, I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **Dot matrix patterns from Altamira Cave echoed in phosphorescent stippled body art:** This directly matches the theme. Prehistoric cave art (Altamira) is replicated ("echoed") in a modern medium ("phosphorescent stippled body art"). High score.

2. **African tribal face paint:** While it involves body art, it lacks the direct link to replicating *prehistoric cave art*. It aligns with the broader theme of cultural patterns on the body but not the specific one. Lower score.

3. **Native American petroglyphs:** This involves ancient art, but it's not specifically *cave art* in the same vein as the examples. It also doesn't explicitly mention a modern replication. Moderate score.

4. **Ancient Greek meanders:** This is an ancient pattern, but not from prehistoric caves. It also doesn't involve modern replication in the same way. Lower score.

5. **Polynesian tribal tattoos:** Similar to African tribal face paint, it's body art with cultural patterns but lacks the prehistoric cave art link and modern replication aspect. Lower score.

6. **Celtic knot designs:** These are intricate designs but not directly related to prehistoric cave art or modern replication of such. Lower score.

7. **Roman mosaic floors:** This involves ancient patterns, but not cave art, and the medium is different. Lower score.

8. **Persian carpet patterns:** These are traditional patterns but lack the prehistoric cave art origin and the modern replication aspect. Lower score.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
