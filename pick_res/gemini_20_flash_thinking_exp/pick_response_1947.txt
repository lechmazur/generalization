The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- a clay incense holder
- a woven meditation mat
- a crystal healing wand

These suggest a theme of items used in spiritual or mindful practices, often made from natural or simple materials.

The anti-examples are:
- a bronze statue
- a gold amulet
- a steel ritual knife

These suggest a broader theme of ritualistic or symbolic objects, often made from precious or strong metals. The key is that the *specific* theme excludes these metallic, potentially ornate, and forceful items.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **tools or aids for personal spiritual practice, often made from natural or simple materials, focusing on inner peace and well-being rather than outward display or forceful action.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **a metal singing bowl**: While metal, it's used for sound healing and meditation, aligning with the spiritual practice aspect. However, it's metal, which is closer to the anti-examples.
2. **an iron bell**: Similar to the singing bowl, but bells can have more varied uses, some less focused on personal spiritual practice. The iron material also leans towards the anti-examples.
3. **a pewter candle holder**: Candle holders can be used in spiritual practices, but pewter is a metal, and it's less directly tied to inner work than the examples.
4. **a wooden prayer bead**: Directly aligns with personal spiritual practice and uses a natural material.
5. **a copper bowl**: Bowls can have various uses. Copper is a metal, though less 'precious' than gold or silver. Its connection to spiritual practice is less direct than the examples.
6. **a silver chalice**: Strongly associated with ritual and often ornate, aligning more with the anti-examples.
7. **a brass incense burner**: Incense is in the examples, and brass is a metal. The function aligns, but the material is closer to the anti-examples.
8. **a titanium pendant**: Pendants can have spiritual significance, but titanium is a modern, strong metal, aligning more with the anti-examples.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
