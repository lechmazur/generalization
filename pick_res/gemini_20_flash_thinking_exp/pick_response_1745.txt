The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme related to textile patterns. The examples feature geometric, tessellated patterns (stars, octagons, diamonds). The anti-examples feature representational or organic motifs (animals, flowers, tribal symbols).

Therefore, the specific theme is **geometric, tessellated patterns in textiles**.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll score each candidate:

*   **Batik sarong from Indonesia:** Batik can have geometric patterns, but often features floral or other natural motifs. Likely a low to mid score depending on the typical batik style.
*   **Cotton embroidered shawl with repeating zigzag borders:** Zigzags are geometric, but not necessarily tessellated in the same way as the examples. Likely a mid score.
*   **Korean hanbok with floral embroidery:** Floral embroidery aligns with the anti-examples. Likely a low score.
*   **West African kente cloth:** Kente cloth often features geometric patterns, sometimes with tessellation. Likely a mid to high score.
*   **Greek embroidered tablecloth:** Embroidery can be geometric, but also floral or representational. Need to consider the typical style. Likely a mid score.
*   **Indian sari with paisley prints:** Paisley is an abstract but organic shape, not strictly geometric tessellation. Likely a low to mid score.
*   **Japanese kimono with cherry blossom patterns:** Cherry blossoms are floral, aligning with the anti-examples. Likely a low score.
*   **Balinese batik wall art:** Similar to the Indonesian batik, it can have geometric patterns but often features natural motifs. Likely a low to mid score.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
