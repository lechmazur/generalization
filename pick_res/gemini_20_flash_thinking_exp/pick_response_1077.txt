The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate how well each candidate matches that specific theme, while explicitly avoiding matching broader, related themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples (Whispering Gallery, Moaning Cavern, Booming Dunes) all relate to natural or man-made locations where sound is amplified, resonates, or is produced in a distinctive way due to the environment.

The anti-examples (Thunder, Niagara Falls, Victoria Falls) all involve loud natural sounds, but these sounds are not primarily defined by the *place* or *environment* in the same way as the examples. They are more about the sound event itself.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be **places or natural phenomena characterized by distinctive sounds produced or modified by their environment or structure.**

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **Echolocation:**  While it involves sound, it's more about the *use* of sound for navigation, not a place with a distinctive sound. It's related but not a direct match to the theme.
2. **Tornado:**  Produces sound, but like the anti-examples, it's more about the event than a place with a characteristic sound.
3. **Sonar:**  Similar to echolocation, it's a technology using sound, not a place with a distinctive sound.
4. **Tsunami:**  Produces sound, but again, it's an event, not a place defined by its sound characteristics.
5. **Hurricane:**  Like a tornado, it's a weather event with sound, not a place with a characteristic sound.
6. **Dog whistle:**  It's a sound, but not associated with a specific place or environment that modifies the sound.
7. **Earthquake:**  Produces sound, but it's an event, not a place defined by its sound characteristics.
8. **Singing Sand:** This directly fits the theme, as it's a natural phenomenon where sand produces a distinctive sound due to environmental factors.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
