The user wants me to evaluate how well each candidate matches a specific theme identified from the examples, while explicitly avoiding matching broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

The core elements of the specific theme are:
- Four-string bass
- Two humbucker pickups
- Single volume knob
- Single tone knob

The anti-examples introduce additional controls like equalizers, blend controls, and separate volume/tone controls, which should be penalized.

I need to score each candidate from 0 to 10 based on how closely it adheres to the specific theme.

Here's a breakdown of how I'll approach each candidate:

1. **Push-pull pot for coil splitting:** This adds functionality beyond the basic theme, but the core controls are still present. It's not a direct match but closer than the anti-examples.
2. **Blend control instead of separate volume knobs:** This deviates from the single volume knob.
3. **Master tone, individual volume:** This deviates from the single volume and single tone.
4. **Two-band equalizer:** This is a clear deviation, similar to the anti-examples.
5. **Simplified controls with single volume and tone:** This is a strong match to the specific theme.
6. **Coil-split, separate volume and tone:** The separate volume control is a deviation.
7. **Master volume, individual tone:** This deviates from the single tone.
8. **Blend control, no tone control:** This deviates from both the single volume and single tone.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
