The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The key is to identify the specific theme and avoid being misled by broader themes suggested by the anti-examples.

Looking at the examples:
- Hopi yucca fiber sandals:  Suggests Native American origin and use of natural fibers.
- Navajo wool blanket:  Reinforces Native American origin and use of natural fibers, specifically wool.
- Cherokee river cane blowgun:  Again, Native American origin and use of natural materials.

The specific theme seems to be "items crafted by Native American cultures of North America using natural materials."

The anti-examples are designed to be misleading:
- Inuit soapstone carving:  While Native American, it's from a different region (Arctic) and uses a different material.
- Bamboo fan from China:  Different culture and material.
- African wooden mask:  Different culture and material.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates against the specific theme:

1. Peruvian alpaca scarf: South American, not North American. Uses natural fiber (alpaca).
2. Haida cedar bark basket:  North American Native (Haida), uses natural material (cedar bark).
3. Indonesian batik cloth:  Southeast Asian, different culture and technique.
4. Australian aboriginal dot painting:  Australian Aboriginal, different culture and art form.
5. Mexican clay pottery:  North American, but not US/Canada Native American.
6. Celtic woven tapestry:  European, different culture.
7. Vietnamese silk embroidery:  Southeast Asian, different culture and material.
8. Maori jade pendant:  Polynesian, different culture and material.
