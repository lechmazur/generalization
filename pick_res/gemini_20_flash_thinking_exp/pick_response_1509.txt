The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to infer the specific theme from the examples and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit *that specific theme*, while explicitly avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The examples are:
- The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
- The University of Denver's High Altitude Laboratory
- The Sphinx Observatory in Switzerland

These all seem to be permanent research or observation facilities located at high altitudes or remote, extreme environments.

The anti-examples are:
- A high-altitude mine accessed by workers daily (high altitude, but not primarily research/observation)
- A high-altitude astronomical observatory only used for short observation periods (high altitude, astronomical observation, but not permanent/long-term)
- A weather station atop Pikes Peak (high altitude, observation, but potentially less focused on research and potentially less remote/extreme than the examples)

The specific theme seems to be **permanent research or observation facilities in remote, high-altitude, or extreme environments**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. A remote mountain monastery: Could be remote and high-altitude, but not primarily research or observation in a scientific sense.
2. Mount Everest Base Camp: High altitude and somewhat remote, but more of a temporary staging area than a permanent research facility.
3. A military radar installation on a mountaintop: High altitude, but the purpose is military, not scientific research or general observation.
4. A communications relay station on a high mountain: High altitude, but the purpose is communication, not research or observation.
5. A radio tower on a mountain: High altitude, but the purpose is broadcasting, not research or observation.
6. The gondola lift station on Aiguille du Midi: High altitude, but primarily for tourist access, not research.
7. The Chacaltaya Astrophysical Observatory in Bolivia: High altitude and an astrophysical observatory, fitting the theme well.
8. A ski resort located above 12,000 feet: High altitude, but for recreation, not research or observation.<number>1</number><score>4</score>
