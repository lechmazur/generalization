The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are protractor, astrolabe, and sundial. The anti-examples are clock face, color wheel, and dartboard. The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations suggested by the anti-examples.

The core theme seems to be instruments used for measuring angles, especially in the context of navigation or astronomy, often involving a circular or semi-circular scale.

The anti-examples are circular but serve different purposes: telling time, organizing colors, and target practice. They highlight that the theme is not just about circular objects.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **circular saw blade**: Circular, but its purpose is cutting, not measuring angles. Likely a low score.
2. **compass rose**: Used for indicating directions, which involves angles. Strong connection to navigation. Likely a high score.
3. **roulette wheel**: Circular, but its purpose is gambling. No direct link to angle measurement. Likely a low score.
4. **CD-ROM**: Circular, used for data storage. No connection to angle measurement. Likely a low score.
5. **steering wheel**: Circular, used for controlling direction. Indirectly related to angles, but not for measurement in the same way as the examples. Likely a moderate score.
6. **ship's helm**: Similar to a steering wheel, used for controlling direction. Indirectly related to angles. Likely a moderate score.
7. **pie chart**: Circular, used for representing proportions. Involves angles, but for data visualization, not direct measurement of the physical world. Likely a moderate score.
8. **vinyl record**: Circular, used for audio storage. No connection to angle measurement. Likely a low score.

Now, let's assign specific scores, ensuring granularity and using the full range.

1. Circular saw blade:  Focus is on cutting, not measuring angles. Score: 1
2. Compass rose: Directly related to navigation and angle indication. Score: 9
3. Roulette wheel: Circular, but for gambling. No angle measurement. Score: 1
4. CD-ROM: Circular, for data storage. No angle measurement. Score: 0
5. Steering wheel: Controls direction, indirectly related to angles. Score: 4
6. Ship's helm: Similar to steering wheel, controls direction. Score: 5
7. Pie chart: Represents proportions using angles, but not direct measurement. Score: 6
8. Vinyl record: Circular, for audio storage. No angle measurement. Score: 0<number>1</number><score>1</score>
