The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are Darjeeling tea, Scotch whisky, and Havana cigar. These are all geographically specific luxury/specialty food or drink items. The anti-examples are Swiss cheese, English breakfast tea, and Belgian waffles. These are also geographically specific food items, but they are more general and less strictly defined or controlled in their production.

The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the *specific* theme, not a broader interpretation. The scoring should be granular and use the full range of 0-10.

Let's analyze each candidate:

1. **Boston cream pie:**  Geographically specific (Boston), but a dessert, not a drink or smokeable item. Less of a luxury item. Likely a low score.
2. **Spanish omelette:** Geographically specific (Spain), but a common dish, not a luxury item. Likely a low score.
3. **Australian rules football:** Geographically specific (Australia), but not a food or drink item. Definitely a low score.
4. **Champagne:** Geographically specific (Champagne region of France), a luxury drink with strict production rules. This seems like a strong match.
5. **Buffalo wings:** Geographically specific (Buffalo, NY), but a common, casual food item. Likely a low score.
6. **Turkish delight:** Geographically specific (Turkey), a sweet treat, often considered a specialty. Could be a moderate score.
7. **Greek yogurt:** Geographically specific (Greece), a common food item. Likely a low score.
8. **French fries:** Geographically specific (France), but a very common, global food item. Likely a low score.

Based on this analysis, I can now assign scores using the full range and ensuring granularity.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
<number>2</number><score>3</score>
<number>3</number><score>0</score>
<number>4</number><score>9</score>
