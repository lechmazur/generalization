The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they match the specific theme, avoiding broader interpretations.

The examples are all radiometric dating methods based on the decay of radioactive isotopes with long half-lives, used for dating geological or archaeological materials.

The anti-examples are also dating methods, but they rely on different principles:
- Obsidian hydration dating: measures the water absorption layer on obsidian.
- Amino acid racemization: measures the change in the chirality of amino acids.
- Electron spin resonance dating: measures trapped electrons in mineral lattices.

The specific theme seems to be **radiometric dating of inorganic materials using long-lived radioactive isotopes**.

Now, let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **archaeomagnetic dating**: Dates materials based on the Earth's magnetic field at the time of their last heating. Not radiometric.
2. **dendrochronology**: Dates events using tree ring patterns. Not radiometric.
3. **radiocarbon dating of organic materials**: Radiometric dating, but specifically for organic materials and using carbon-14 (shorter half-life compared to the examples).
4. **cosmogenic nuclide dating**: Measures isotopes produced by cosmic ray interactions. Radiometric, but the production mechanism is different.
5. **varve chronology**: Dates events based on annual layers of sediment. Not radiometric.
6. **stratigraphic layering in archaeology**: Relative dating based on the order of layers. Not radiometric.
7. **tree ring analysis**: Same as dendrochronology. Not radiometric.
8. **ice core sampling**: Dates events based on layers of ice. Not radiometric.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>2</score>
