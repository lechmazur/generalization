The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score new candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

Looking at the examples:
- Nature Republic Soothing & Moisture Aloe Vera Gel
- Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Gel
- Green Leaf Naturals Aloe Vera Gel

These are all pure aloe vera gels marketed for topical use, often for soothing and moisturizing. They emphasize "Aloe Vera Gel".

Looking at the anti-examples:
- Aloe ferox gel cream
- Aloe arborescens extract
- Aloe vera capsules

These are related to aloe but are not the same specific product. "Aloe ferox" and "Aloe arborescens" are different species of aloe. "Capsules" indicate an oral form, not topical gel. "Gel cream" suggests a formulation that is not purely gel.

The specific theme seems to be **pure aloe vera gel for topical application, primarily for soothing and moisturizing**.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. Aloe vera hand sanitizer: While it contains aloe vera, the primary function is sanitizing, not moisturizing. It's a different product category.
2. Aloe vera toothpaste:  Again, contains aloe vera, but the primary function is oral hygiene. Different product category.
3. Aloe Vera juice drink: This is for ingestion, not topical application.
4. Aloe vera face wash: Topical, but the primary function is cleansing, not solely moisturizing. It's a formulated product, not pure gel.
5. Aloe vera soap: Topical, but the primary function is cleansing. It's a formulated product.
6. Aloe vera mouthwash: For oral hygiene, not topical skin application.
7. Aloe vera shampoo: For hair care, not general skin moisturizing. It's a formulated product.
8. Seven Minerals Pure Aloe Vera Gel: This directly matches the theme - pure aloe vera gel.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>3</score>
