The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples clearly point towards *engineered structures made using additive manufacturing (3D printing) for functional purposes*. The anti-examples highlight naturally occurring structures that share some structural similarities but are not manufactured.

Therefore, the core criteria for a high score are:
1. **Manufactured/Engineered:** The object must be intentionally created by humans.
2. **Additive Manufacturing:** The manufacturing process should involve building the object layer by layer.
3. **Functional Purpose:** The object should serve a specific intended function.

Let's evaluate each candidate against these criteria:

* **Coral skeleton:** Natural, not manufactured. Low score.
* **Foam core sandwich panel:** Manufactured, but not necessarily using additive manufacturing. Could be other processes. Medium score.
* **Truss bridge design:** Engineered, but the design itself isn't a physical object made with additive manufacturing. Low-medium score.
* **Plant stem:** Natural, not manufactured. Low score.
* **Spider web:** Natural, not manufactured. Low score.
* **Geodesic dome:** Engineered structure, but not necessarily made with additive manufacturing. Could be constructed using various methods. Medium score.
* **Corrugated cardboard:** Manufactured, but not using additive manufacturing. Medium score.
* **3D printed titanium bicycle frame:** Manufactured using additive manufacturing, for a functional purpose. High score.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
