The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are "folding sunshade", "collapsible windscreen", and "portable rain shelter". These all suggest a portable, temporary structure for protection from the elements. The anti-examples are "parasol", "raincoat", and "windbreaker". These are also for protection from the elements, but are worn or held, not structures.

The core of the specific theme seems to be: **portable, temporary, freestanding (or easily supported) structures for protection from sun, wind, or rain.**

Now, let's evaluate each candidate against this specific theme:

1. **poncho**: Provides rain protection, is portable, but is worn, not a structure. Closer to "raincoat" (anti-example).
2. **hat**: Provides sun protection, is portable, but is worn, not a structure. Closer to "parasol" (anti-example) in terms of sun protection, but worn.
3. **umbrella**: Provides rain and sun protection, is portable, and is a structure, though held. Closer to the examples than the anti-examples.
4. **sun visor**: Provides sun protection, is portable, but is worn, not a structure. Closer to "parasol" (anti-example) in terms of sun protection, but worn.
5. **sunglasses**: Provide sun protection, are portable, but are worn, not a structure.
6. **jacket**: Provides wind and rain protection, is portable, but is worn, not a structure. Closer to "raincoat" and "windbreaker" (anti-examples).
7. **awning**: Provides sun and rain protection, is a structure, but is typically fixed, not portable.
8. **goggles**: Provide protection (eyes), are portable, but are worn, not a structure.
