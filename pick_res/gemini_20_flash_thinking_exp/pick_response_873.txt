The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme.

The examples suggest the theme is about **ordinary, everyday objects being repurposed or modified to secretly store valuables**. The anti-examples (vault, safe, lockbox) are purpose-built security containers, which highlights the "secret" and "repurposed" aspects of the theme.

I need to evaluate each candidate based on how well it fits the idea of a common object being adapted for hidden storage, as opposed to a dedicated security device.<number>1</number><score>9</score>
