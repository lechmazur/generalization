The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the specific theme and then evaluate the candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme, not a broader interpretation.

The examples all involve ceramic objects that incorporate game pieces as part of their structure or texture.

The anti-examples involve game pieces themselves, ceramic objects with game-related imagery, or sculptures made entirely of game pieces. These are related but not the specific theme.

Therefore, the specific theme is **ceramic objects that incorporate game pieces into their physical structure**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme:

1. **A board game with ceramic playing pieces:** This is close but the game pieces are separate, not incorporated into a larger ceramic object.
2. **A set of hand-painted playing cards:** This is not ceramic and doesn't incorporate game pieces into its structure.
3. **A ceramic tile with a game-related design printed on it:** This is ceramic but the game element is a design, not incorporated pieces.
4. **A hand-thrown ceramic vase, glazed in a deep blue, with several dice embedded in the base:** This fits the specific theme.
5. **A wooden chess set:** This is not ceramic.
6. **A hand-carved wooden game board:** This is not ceramic.
7. **A ceramic mug with a game logo printed on it:** This is ceramic but the game element is a logo, not incorporated pieces.
8. **A collection of vintage board games:** This is not ceramic and doesn't incorporate game pieces into a larger structure.<number>1</number><score>6</score>
