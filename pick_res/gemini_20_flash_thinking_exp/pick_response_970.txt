The user has provided three examples and three anti-examples of a specific theme. The examples are geographical locations named after mathematicians. The anti-examples are mathematical concepts named after mathematicians. The task is to evaluate a list of candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme (geographical locations named after mathematicians) and not the broader theme (anything named after a mathematician).

Let's evaluate each candidate:
1. Boolean Algebra: A mathematical concept. Does not fit the specific theme. Score: 0-1
2. Laplace's Equation: A mathematical equation. Does not fit the specific theme. Score: 0-1
3. Hilbert Space: A mathematical space. Does not fit the specific theme. Score: 0-1
4. Gauss Crater on the Moon: A geographical feature (crater) named after a mathematician (Gauss). Fits the specific theme. Score: 9-10
5. Archimedes' Principle: A physical principle. Does not fit the specific theme. Score: 0-1
6. Ramanujan's Conjecture: A mathematical conjecture. Does not fit the specific theme. Score: 0-1
7. Galois Theory: A mathematical theory. Does not fit the specific theme. Score: 0-1
8. Bernoulli's Equation: A fluid dynamics equation. Does not fit the specific theme. Score: 0-1

Based on this initial assessment, the scores will be heavily skewed towards 0 or 1, with one potential 9 or 10. I need to ensure the scores are granular and nuanced. Perhaps there are subtle differences in how closely the anti-examples relate to the broader theme, which could influence the scoring of the candidates even if they don't fit the specific theme.

Re-evaluating with nuance:
1. Boolean Algebra: Purely abstract mathematics. Strong anti-example. Score: 1
2. Laplace's Equation: A specific mathematical equation, more concrete than Boolean Algebra. Score: 2
3. Hilbert Space: A more abstract mathematical concept than an equation, but still within mathematics. Score: 1
4. Gauss Crater on the Moon: Directly fits the specific theme. Score: 10
5. Archimedes' Principle: A principle in physics, related to the real world but not a geographical location. Score: 2
6. Ramanujan's Conjecture: A specific mathematical conjecture, similar to Laplace's Equation. Score: 2
7. Galois Theory: A broader mathematical theory, more abstract than a specific equation. Score: 1
8. Bernoulli's Equation: A specific equation in physics, similar to Archimedes' Principle. Score: 2
