The user has provided three examples of a specific theme and three anti-examples. The examples are: a burning bush that was not consumed, the parting of the Red Sea, and the raining of manna from heaven. These all seem to be miraculous events from the Bible, specifically related to Moses and the Exodus. The anti-examples are a flood, a drought, and an earthquake. These are natural disasters, which are broader events but not the specific type of miraculous intervention seen in the examples.

The task is to evaluate eight candidates based on how well they fit the specific theme, not just a broader theme. The candidates are: a tornado, a solar eclipse, a tsunami, the stopping of the sun in the sky, a volcanic eruption, a thunderstorm, a hurricane, and a lunar eclipse.

Let's evaluate each candidate:

1. **a tornado:** This is a natural weather phenomenon, similar to the anti-examples. It doesn't fit the specific theme of a divine miracle in the context of the Exodus. Score: 1

2. **a solar eclipse:** This is a natural astronomical event. While it might have been interpreted as a sign in ancient times, it's not the same type of miraculous intervention as the examples. Score: 2

3. **a tsunami:** This is a natural disaster, similar to the anti-examples. It doesn't fit the specific theme. Score: 1

4. **the stopping of the sun in the sky:** This is a miraculous event described in the Bible (Joshua). It fits the specific theme of a divine intervention that defies natural laws. Score: 9

5. **a volcanic eruption:** This is a natural disaster, similar to the anti-examples. It doesn't fit the specific theme. Score: 1

6. **a thunderstorm:** This is a natural weather phenomenon. While powerful, it's not the same type of miraculous event. Score: 2

7. **a hurricane:** This is a natural weather phenomenon, similar to the anti-examples. It doesn't fit the specific theme. Score: 1

8. **a lunar eclipse:** This is a natural astronomical event, similar to a solar eclipse. It's not the same type of miraculous intervention. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>1</score>
