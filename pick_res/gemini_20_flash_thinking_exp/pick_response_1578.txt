The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score how well a list of candidates matches that specific theme.

The examples are all about physical separation based on mechanical means and physical properties:
- Vibratory bowl feeder: uses vibration and physical barriers/shapes.
- Trommel screen: uses a rotating screen with different sized holes.
- Centrifuge: uses centrifugal force based on density.

The anti-examples are about separation but using different principles:
- Optical sensors: uses light and electronic analysis.
- Conveyor system sorting by size: uses physical barriers but relies on a moving belt and potentially sensors for size detection.
- Air jets: uses air pressure.

The specific theme seems to be **mechanical separation based on physical properties or size, often involving some form of physical agitation or force**. It's not just about any kind of separation.

Now, let's evaluate the candidates:

1. **Washing machine:** Uses water and agitation to clean, not primarily to separate different types of items. It separates dirt from clothes, but that's not the core function in the context of the examples. Doesn't fit the specific theme.
2. **Blender:**  Mixes, doesn't separate. Opposite of the theme.
3. **Device that separates items based on weight:** This aligns with the physical property aspect of the theme, similar to a centrifuge.
4. **Machine that sorts items using a linear motion:**  Could be similar to a vibratory feeder, depending on the specifics of the linear motion. Potentially a good match.
5. **Device that separates items using gravity:**  Similar to the trommel screen where gravity plays a role. A good match.
6. **Magnetic separator:** Uses magnetic force, a physical property, for separation. Fits the theme.
7. **Sifter:** Uses a screen to separate based on size, very similar to a trommel screen. Strong match.
8. **Filtration system:** Separates based on size by passing through a filter medium. Similar to the trommel screen but the mechanism is different. Closer than the anti-examples but not as direct as the examples.

Based on this analysis, I will assign scores to each candidate.<number>1</number><score>1</score>
