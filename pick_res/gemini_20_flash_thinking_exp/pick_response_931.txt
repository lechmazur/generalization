The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme. I need to identify the core characteristics of the examples and differentiate them from the broader themes represented by the anti-examples.

Examples suggest:
- Natural materials (mulberry, bamboo, clay)
- Traditional craftsmanship (hand-woven, fired in earthen kiln)
- Specific purposes (paper, fishing basket, water vessel)

Anti-examples suggest:
- Mass production (factory-made, industrial)
- Synthetic materials (synthetic dye, synthetic leather)
- Modern processes (factory-made)

The specific theme seems to be **handmade items using natural materials and traditional techniques**.

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this specific theme, avoiding the broader themes.
