The user has provided examples and anti-examples of a specific theme and wants me to score a list of candidates based on how well they fit that specific theme. The examples are Ingapirca, Kuelap, and Pukara de Quitor. The anti-examples are Tiwanaku, Ollantaytambo, and Chan Chan.

Looking at the examples, they are all pre-Columbian sites in the Andes region, specifically fortifications or defensive settlements.

The anti-examples, while also pre-Columbian sites, represent different types of settlements or have different characteristics. Tiwanaku is a major ceremonial center, Ollantaytambo is a complex with agricultural terraces and a ceremonial center, and Chan Chan is a large adobe city.

Therefore, the specific theme seems to be "pre-Columbian Andean fortifications or defensive settlements".

Now I need to evaluate each candidate based on this theme:

1. Ciudad Perdida: Located in Colombia, it's an ancient city, but its primary characteristic isn't necessarily defensive. Score: 6
2. Teotihuacan: Located in Mexico, not in the Andes. Score: 1
3. El Tajín: Located in Mexico, not in the Andes. Score: 1
4. Machu Picchu: Located in the Andes and has defensive features, but also served other purposes. Score: 8
5. Chichen Itza: Located in Mexico, not in the Andes. Score: 1
6. Sacsayhuamán: Located in the Andes and is a significant fortress. Score: 9
7. Caral: Located in the Andes, but predates the Inca and its primary function wasn't necessarily defensive. Score: 4
8. Copán: Located in Honduras, a Mayan city, not in the Andes. Score: 2<number>1</number><score>6</score>
