Taking inspiration from the list above, create a theme, category, or criterion (called theme from now on) that connects multiple elements (not necessarily on the list above) through a specific, verifiable relationship. The theme should define a precise characteristic or relationship that can be objectively verified. None of the things above have to be examples of this theme but it should be inspired by at least one of them. It can cover physical objects, ideas, or anything else. The theme can connect things from different categories. For example, a theme stating "things that use branching structures to organize or distribute information" connects river tributaries, neural pathways, and organizational charts.

You must prefer specific categories of concrete things to abstract patterns, processes or theoretical relationships.

The theme must be specific enough that when shared with others, they can understand the underlying pattern or connection and independently identify new elements that satisfy this theme, though it should be challenging for them to do so. It must be possible to derive at least four examples from this theme but the theme should be specific enough there are not many examples. The theme must be able to be written in one sentence but be complex enough to be interesting. The theme should have clear boundaries. Output this theme enclosed in tags <theme></theme>. Do not output any examples of the theme or additional explanations. Focus on forming categories or themes that revolve around definable properties. 

Some sample themes: "small things natural with cores", "1980s dance fads that were well known", "movie titles that are Eastern European cities", "first words in 2000s rappers' names".
